1,1,"Finally, Despite the chanlleges and dangers they are all striving to meet the challenge. ","Students have the tendency to not to things if told by another individual, but when the idea is introduced by oneself, the individual is more inclined to do it.  The Hunger Games is a novel that displays a similar effect; being based off of a numerous amount of decisions that could either end up in an individual's death, or survival, a certain scene in this book depicts the choosing of a weapon. The main character, Katniss, chooses a bow and arrow, being a weapon that the character has a great strength in and has a higher chance in succeeding with it. Having the ability to choose and having a personalized approach to the task makes one's task more likely to be completed with great excellence, especially if the individual personalizes the project to aid their strengths rather than their weaknesses. A teacher would not be able to identify a student's weaknesses, resulting in a weaker result than anticipated. "

4,4,In conclusion if we could possibly bulid something to survive venus we could find some amazing things like if it ever ahad water and find maybe remains of past forms of life. ,"Well, first of all, The atmospere of Venus has a THICK layer of carbon dioxide the covers 98% of the planet, in which makes Everything a much hoter place,but, to top it of with the atmosphere problem, the clouds in there have highly corrosive sulfuric acid. If we some how passes through the atmosphere, than we'll face ANOTHER problem with the ground. Since Venus is the second planet from our sun and with all those carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the surface ground temperature is over 800 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT. In which with the surface and the atmosphere, it could basically melt many types of metal with no problem. Another Problem is that the atmosphereic preassure is 90x greater than our Earth, with that much preassure could easily crushed a submarine that is built to surrvive the deeper end of the ocean. From what we gather small information from our space craft, the geology of venus pretty much have erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes. "

The people who are specializing in doing this kind of technology, are branching out in very large, and impactful ways. Many students could be interested in doing this, and sometimes if it's not in school and they don't hear of it. They can never find it. "
6,6,"The third and final reason for the abolishment of the EC is simple. The votes NEVER count, like ever. ","For many reasons, election methods must be changed to popular vote, and the Electoral College must be disgarded.

This is the only way the U.S can finally reach its long term goal-- complete prosperity.    "

8,8,Auther did a very great job finding his resouces and fact about his story he told ,"As a consultant that helps other students with writing, I see many strange things from people with half finished essays. The one that grabs the trophy, however, was incredibly ridiculous. At the beggining of a students work, they talked about how Abraham Lincoln and George Washington had a conversation. Not only did it have nothing to do with their central theme of Lincoln being the best president, but I gaurentee you they did not have multiple people help review their work. We did get them the help they needed, and through multiple peoples advice, it was transformed into a pretty good persuasive essay. When searching for help, whether it's with editing a school paper, or understanding concepts that are confusing for you in a difficulty subject, it's always important to look for more than one opinion. If you were to only ask a singe individual, their response could be flawed for many, many reasons "

12,12,"The electoral college is a process, not a place. The electoral college process consists of the selection of the electors. The electoral college consists of 538 electors. In the 23 Amendment of the constitution, the district of columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated  like a state for purposes of the electoral college. For this reason, in the following discussion, the word ""state"" also refers to the district of columbia. Next, each canidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors.  The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party,but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are.  The president election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. Also, most states have a ""winner-take-all"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential canidate . However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of ""proportion representation"".  Abolishing the electoral college! But don't worry they're not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore.  Thanks to the quirks of the electoral college, which won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voterswould prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.  Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.  You might not know this so if you dont here is something very interesting for you to know. Who are the electors? Well they can be snoyone not holding public office. Here's something eles you might know, Who picks the electors in the first place? well here's the answer it depends on the state. The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor.  The American people should consider themselces lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for must more. consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and thats those electors could always defy the will of the people. Black in 1960.  Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the hose of representatives, where state deegations vote on the president. ","When the Constitution of the United States was written our founding fathers decided on an Electoral College as the way to ellect the president instead of a direct vote. The Electoral College is a process that makes a compromise between the popular vote of the citizens and the Congressional vote. When citizens vote for president they are actually voting for a member of the Electoral College that is going to select their president, rather than the citizens voting for the president themselves. The Electoral College is made of 538 electors, the number of electors from each state varies depending on the states Congressional delegation. Washington D.C. is counted as a state for this process and alloted only three electors. "
13,13,but I do know that it was not made by aliens. ,"In 1976 the face looked like a face. In 1998 it started to not look like a face at all. In 2001 it just looked like a rock. So i believe that it was not created by aliens but that it was just something the olanet had made itself. This has certainly got the attention of the people.  The ""Face on Mars"" is not a face. If you look at the pictures from 1976, and 1998, and 2001 and in the text it says that the photo from 2001 is the most recent photo that NASA has. It still looks nothing like a face so since the 2001 picture is the most recent it shows that it is just a natural landform. It is just a natural landform. On Mars there are natural landforms everywhere and the fade away. Here on earth natural landforms are created everyday. "

15,15,What i can also personally add to this parrgraph is things are way more depenable and understanding and way more better and trustfull and when many people join their heads together. ,"Seeking multiple opinions and advice can be beneficial to someone because it can provide new ideas that previously have never been thought of, and help understand different perspectives on the topic. It's always important to ask for assistance and feedback when you need it. Because receiving that constructive criticism and working with it reassures the outcome is successful and applies to a larger audience. Overall, asking peers for their opinions can be an eye opener, and refresh one's mind in order to get their point across a variety of people. The more feedback one receives, the stronger the outcome becomes.  "

There is no good or bad option for this. It's all on the situation on hand. Both thing have there goods and there bad ,but it is up for these school departments to know if it will help the student or make it worse than it was already. ","By attending class online, students do not have to deal with the daily chores of waking up early, preparing for school, and in many cases rushing to leave in order to not be late. Being tardy for a class can be severely punished even if it was not directly the students fault, which could lower productivity and motivation. It is widely known that students complain about this dilemma already, and with online learning, it can be solved in a simple and cost effective way. "
18,18,So in the storu it talks about going to diffrenet places in our solar system so in the story it talks about how some plants can actually hold humans in it cuase it has the same things this planet has but not all of them. So they where talking about a planet in particular venus a planet right next to us we can have a spaceship go there. they talk about some of venus things like how hot it is the planet reaches 800 degrees. ,"The author also states that ""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."". This shows the readers that Venus is worth studying because there may have been life on this planet. Therefore, NASA needs to send researchers to Venus to identify if there is life or not. The author gives another example by referencing Earth-like features to show that thesremay be some form of life or a way of nature, these references include Venus having mountains, valleys, and craters. This validates the authors point well. "
19,19,"technoloy floods our brain, meaning there is so many inventions it just brainwashes us. We can use photo I.D. now for getting on to our phone.

So people are still wandering what the mona lisa represents, the mona lisa represents art and beauty. There is a song called mona lisa, and its kinda a love song, saying your my mona lisa baby. So i think the whole idea of this song is to show that the mona lisa is a thing of beauty it represnts more than just beauty.  What else does it represent, well does your expression in the mirror suggest an emotion? Do you feel mad or sad. if you felt sad and you were crying and you went to the mirror and looked in the mirror, what would you see in yourself because down deep inside if thing yuo incredibly hurt. Can your lab partner recgonize which emotion you are doing? yes there is a doctor for that. there are so many emotions you dint even know throughout the day.

How can a group of peoples say mean more then thousands of people in the United States. Also, the ""Winner-Take-All"" sytem does not help anymore then the Electoral college does.

23,23,The consequences should be very big for being on a cell phone or let alone bringing a cell phone to school. Students should at least have a detention or even an in school suspension. Students need to know their boundaries and what happens when they cross them. Discipline is a great way to turn students off their cell phones ,Student should be allowed to keep there phones on their person as long as they are turned off at all times during a regular school day. this then creates the problem of students texting during school hours and class so I propose that students who are caught texting or using the cell phone during school our not in the case of an emergency should have there phones took away for a set amount of time. much like if a student does something wrong he/she is punished with a certain amount of time. 
24,24,like the one we have today. ,"A teacher who knows their students can better tailor the lessons to them based on their learning styles and needs. For example, a teacher could dedicate more time in class to review logarithmic functions with games or act out  Romeo and Juliet to help the students better understand the concepts. Activities such as these that are beneficial to students are not possible through distance learning, and could harm a student's level of understanding about a topic. Additionally, it is harder for students to get help when they do not understand new material or need clarification through distance learning. Traditionally, students can ask their teachers questions, visit their teachers during their office hours or study hall, or meet with a peer tutor. For distance learning, a student would have to video call or email their teacher, but it is much harder to explain or understand concepts without being able to meet in person. "

The author of this article talks of how it will improve ad placements by whether you smile or frown, however I know for a fact social medias, especially Facebook, are already basing information on preferable ads by just what material you look at. Why is it necessary for a program to constantly scan our face just to see if we like something or not? This gives the computer so much power of constantly knowing what your exact emotions are on everything. It is just so unnecessary that it causes one to question why in the world would we risk giving computers that kind of power. Also, is it appropiate to constantly scan childrens' faces as they are trying to learn? Would there be a security system in place or parental agreement necessary that would allow the permission of constant invasion of privacy in the name of education? There are many ethical questions and unknown future outlooks that one would not want to subject children to that sort of test of safety and security. "
26,26,Some people thinks its funny to watch other contenets to bein war. ,"We all know where there are friends, there are foes. When you group a bunch of developing teenagers going through puberty, where emotions and hormones are swarming around, you get a sort of cesspool of emotion. Yes, at times there will be drama, fights, gossip, harassment, and many other things normal to the life of every day teens. Some may say this is a lie, but it is very well the cold hard truth.

Also stated, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"" (8). The author is promoting curiosity because it leads us to new things. Curiosity can overcome the fear of danger when exploring Venus to help us learn new things about the planet. To summarize, the power of curiosity in people is something the author uses to support their opinion of Venus being worth it to explore. "

Liars, we are liars then. Americans project an image of America to the world that we are a peacful democracy. However, if the way that we select our leaders isn't even democratic, why are we portraying this false mirage. The electoral college is an anachronism (lines 15- 16). We are a stage four country on the demographic treansitions model. Therefore, our aspirations should be looking forward and not rooted in the past. "

No one can denty however, that NASA has proven the Face to be nothing but a natural landform on the Red Planet Mars. NASA has proven this by recent pictures, scientific evidence, and real-life examples and measurements. Over the years, NASA has worked hard to figure out the mystery of the face, and just recently they have discovered, with pictyures, evidence, and measruements, that the Face is just a natural landform with unusual shadowing formed on the Red Planet Mars.

37,37,"Therefore, I agree with what the passage is saying because it says ''The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electors votes is required to elect the President.

Also in source two it states that the number of electors we have equals to the amount of members of congress we have. I propose a new system by only letting the American people select our president by votes counted all up by each state, for example if we didn't have have electoral college,  then it would be a fair vote because people votes would count the number that adds up with all votes for one candidates that will oppose another candidates and there would be technically no tie it would either ,more or less, but if we still had the electoral college then the vote would not be equally fair becuse if the majority of a state for examlpe  chose republican candidate, then that would be vague becuse some people choose democratic and there vote did not really count. but without the electoral collge, than everyones vote counts and each candidates gets vote from every one, not only electoral.

There are over five hundred members of the Electoral College, and if a canadate wants to win presidency, he/she has to gain 270 of the Electoral College's votes.

45,45,"Venus is a very dangrus planet its ben proven, not one human has lasted more than a few hours floating above the fray,its been more than three decades since a space ship has tuched venus but ","Venus, otherwise known as the ""Evening Star,"" is one of the more challenging planets to examine closely in our solar system. While this plant is often called Earth's twin, it is vastly different in terms of environment and hospitability. Despite being the closest planet to Earth at times, no spaceship has touched down on Venus in over thirty years. The dangers presented by Venus are many, but the author greatly supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite these dangers. "
46,46,I think it is a good thing then all you will have to do is say to your computers how do i feel today it will say to you ,"like its says in paragraph 6 ""Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad"". For example if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen a similar ad might follow. But if you frown the next ad will be different ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored ""Most human communication is nonverbal including emotional communication"" noted Dr. Huang ""So computers need to understand that too "
47,47,"If you don't want to make all the kids in the school do community service, then i think you should put up a sign up sheet for students who want to so they can sign up, and have a day or two every week were they leave school for a couple hours to go do some community service with some teachers that volunteers also.  ","If you get behind my idea, I know students and teachers will follow us and make a huge difference in our community.  We could even send out e-mails to each student's parents telling them of this idea.  If the parents find out about this, I believe they will certainly force their kids to take part in a small amount of community service.  All I am asking from you, is to just enforce this one little rule into our school.  It could change lives.  I am not asking for everybody to do a whole lot, just 24 hours of your life to help out the community.  There are so many opportunities for our students to help out our community.  Who knows, maybe you could save somebody's life while doing the community service.  "
48,48,NASA is working on a lot of different approaches on how to last a while or have a good landing on Venus. ,"When discussing the potential plans to explore the planet, the author states ""Many researches are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus."" This quote makes it clear to the audience that scientists are doing whatever it takes to develop multiple, efficient plans for space travel. The author also goes onto provide different examples to further convey how close scientists are to developing the safest plan possible. They specifically mention the use of simplified electronics made of silicon carbide and explain how they've already been tested in a chamber that simulate the conditions of Venus's surfaces, yet how they're still being improved upon. They also describe an old technology called mechanical computer, noting how this technology has already been used frequently in the 1940's and how it can be incorporated into space travel now. The author has given detailed descriptions of the efforts made and the options available to provide a safe embarkment for humans to support the ideas that Venus is a worthy pursit. "
49,49,I have done research ,"Cooperation is a skill which gives people the ability to build upon each others strengths and weaknesses, and is the source of many significant discoveries. Often we see that the scientific community caters to its researchers by promoting peer-reviewed journals and research to be conducted. This sentiment holds true with education in America. In order for students to learn over the summer, they should be encouraged to produce their own projects with individuals whom they spend their time with during the summer. I recall being pestered by taking on the burden of conducting a lab report by myself, which caused me to feel stressed out and disengaged. One day in physics class, my teacher allowed me to conduct a lab with many of my friends to make the lab procedure dynamic. I found that by being with my contemporaries, I was inclined to learn more about physics, and to collect accurate and precise data. Students who create their own projects are allowed the opportunity to learn through cooperation, which betters suits them especially during summer break. Many students are already flustered by the work load they receive during the school year, furthermore projects in summer break should bring students together in learning not steer them away in frustration. "
50,50,I hear you are trying to make a decision on whether all students should be required to perform community service. ,I think that you should consider making community service mandatory for all students. 
51,51,Its like the man it the moon it is just a landscape it is nothing big at all. By saying that it is an alien people today would probally believe that it is true they would go crazy. ,"Contrary to popular belief, there is nothing unatural about the supposed ""Face on Mars"". Though many would like to believe in the supernatural, this oddity is nothing but a rock formation. There are several reasons as to why the theory of aliens making this formation is preposterous, each reason stronger than the previous. "
52,52,"No one should force you too do anything that is outside of your comfort zone except your parents, they can force you to do anything they need you too do. Other than your parents and family members,no one should even think about forcing you to do something because that is just a horrible thing to do. unless they have permission from your parents, I don't think that they should be able to tell you that you can or can't do extracurricular activities because that would'nt be fair to the people who actually enjoy them. As for the rest of us, we'll be fine her as long as we don't have to do any pointless extracurricular activities. So to answer the question, would you like to have to do an extracurricular, No! not at all, but some people might ","Let's say the options the school provides are all not of interest to them, so they're forced to take something they don't want to do. How would you like to be forced to commit to something you didn't want to do to start with? I'm pretty sure no one would want that. Though extracurricular activities are great for students to do, some are just reserved and are shy when having to do things in front of people. For students with anxiety, that is extremely embarrassing. Plus, if you force someone to do something they don't want to do, they'll just do it with half-effort and that makes everything one step harder for the people who actually wanted to do that activity. I can almost guarantee that this will happen if schools force students to do this, and it'll just make the activities less fun for the ones who actually want to do it. "
53,53,we should be able to pick and choose what's in our schools ,"Ultimately, there are benefits and disadvantages to both online and public school and all students are different so it is up to parents and students to communicate and find what is the right choice for them. The question I believe should be posed when deciding between an online school and a public school is, how are people supposed to adapt and learn from the world if they are sheltered from the very world they are meant to grow with? The answer is very simple, they cannot.  "
54,54,"FACS can classify six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness just by seeing the the movements of your facial muscles. ","It can read a total of six emotions with some branches coming off of those emotions. The six emotions are stated in the quote,"" Eckman has classified six basic emotions - happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness - and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles."" The machine is able to determine whether a student is in distress or not thus telling the teacher to help the student out with the problem that they are facing. The teacher would be able to help the student cope and deal with their emotional sadness or anger and tell them how to deal with it in order to assist them in getting through it. This is not the end though of what this incredible machine can do for a school. "
55,55,"This way it will teach the students that they shouldn't litter and that it is bad, and damages a lot of our property and if they do it they will have to pay for what they have done and suffer a big punishment. For example if someone throws a drink bottle on the ground it is there responsibility and they should clean it up. ","Every time, theirs a student that doesn't care and leave their garbage on the floor. If we open up this program we could make students more responsible to the school. If the students see the hard work some people take to clean the school environment they would appreciate the work they done and might not want to throw their garbage on the floor like they used to. They would see that since now its them that pick up the garbage and not other people they would be more responsible and throw it the garbage can. "
56,56,If the principle were to make this rule then everyone wouldnt be as lazy. ,Some people are to lazy to help out . If we teach children to help out now they won't be lazy in the future 
57,57,A magority of 270 elctors votes are reqiured. 3 Electors and treated like a state of purpose. Running for president has their own group  of elcetors. Help choose the states electors when you vote for canidate. Governer prepares a Certificate of Ascertanaiment. ,"In the article  What Is The Electoral College by the office of the Federal Register, it states that the election process is held every four years along with the after election prepared by the govenor titled ""Certificate Of Ascertainment"" which sums the canadidates and electors as well as the winning canadidate. It is obvious that the voters only know so much of what they vote for and do not really get a good taste of how the presidential canadidate is like. It can be clear that as a blind election, the voters have no hints of who they might be voting towards and in the end can cause a major catasrophe if a canadidate has very little intentions for the states. In agreement to the article the text  In the defense of the electoral college by Richard A. Posner it begins to sate the election of Romney who, by increasing his plurality and possesing only regional appeal, lost the peoples desire to vote for him thinking that the man has no regards for their interest and does not have any intentions of improving their needs or helping with creating a community where the people can rely on Romney. The actions taken began to change the thoughts of the citizens and create a petrifying conclusion that the man was not on the run to be everyone's president. This dilema could have been changed around if Romney had shown that he had cared more for his state and his country and thought more about the needs he could fill and the actions he could improve, then many of the voters would have most likely shown repsect and a desire for the man to be choosen as their new president. On the opposing hand Romney had not shown any of those qualities or passion which had caused for him to be thought of as unresponisble and selfish.  The country has more than thousands and thousands of people to serve and direct. It can be understood that having a large amount of citizens can result in uncertainty towards the election and the votes cast, yet it is yet to be changed to a more reasonable way of confronting it. With many systems such as ""Winner-Take -All"" due to states titled as the ""Swing States,"" it can be an untrustworthy election fo rmany voters around the country. The election process not only need to be changed to select a more responsible canadidate, but to create a more trustworthy system of itself.  "
58,58,"Everybody is different most people that read somebody's emotion is because there a love one or a every good friend and they can read your emotion. There is just other people that don't care. Most people should be able to see if your angry, sad or happy. Those emotions are easy to see, kids show it all the time even when there not feeling so good. ","Humans can often acknowledge how they are feeling, but the acknowledgement itself does not allow them to feel better. As stated in the article, ""They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one"" (D'Alto 7). This line states that the lab partner will be able to tell a difference netween a genuine and meaningful smile from a harshly forced smile. There is a difference between the two because smiling will not make you happy although it is a happy gesture. The machine informing someone that they need to smile will not actually change the emotions of that person. Politicians and celebrities are major culprits of this action. They often smile as they are told to do, but they are not always genuine. They are typically hiding something from their spectators such as when they are not being truthful (D'Alto 8). Just because famous people smile when talking or looking at their audience does not change whether or not they are happy individuals. If humans themselves are unable to change their emotions when they can detect that something is wrong, then machines will be unable to do that also. Although it can give people a precise measurement of their emotions, it will not change how they feel. Therefore, investing in this system would be extremely useless and wasteful. "
59,59,"You are helping them by choosing wich president will help them and thier family have a better life. The citizens know what they need, they know if Obama is going to help them or not. They know who to vote for because they are providing what they need to live good life. If more citizens vote ofr one president then another, gues what? You just helped more then half of the us a citizens because they knew wich president helped them more. The trouble is out here and you can only fix it with us.  ",In conclusion changing the way people vote is easier for everybody. It saves time for electors and it gives people a chance to see who they are really voting for. Presidents would have to go to each state and appeal to them in order to get a vote. I belive that is what we need. They would be required to actually work for a position in office rather than speaking on whjat they are going to do and paying someone else to elect them. We should have faith in our president and know who we are voting for before we cast our vote. This system seems more fair and more modern to the twenty first century. This is a system most Americans would agree with. 
60,60,In 1976 Viking 1 took a photo of formations on mars. The picture looked like a face so the people of the world thought oh my god. Aliens invaded mars and they will invade us run ,"In 1976, the Viking 1 spacecraft was orbiting the planet of Mars, and it was taking new pictures for all of mankind to see. As it was passing over a strip of Mars called Cydonia, it snapped a picture that would cause an uproar in space exploration. This new picture showed what seemed to be a human face. A few days later NASA reveled these pictures for the world to see; it was an instant hit "
61,61,I think there is some good things about the Electroal College but some things I do not agree ,"There are many reasons that the Elctoral College is unfair to the voters of the U.S. State inequality, diaster, ties, and people loosing the urge to vote. The list goes on and on and if this doesn't make you see what is wrong with this system than I don't know what will. I hope you take this information to good use and use it to tear down this unfair system once and for all. If we really want to be a democracy, than we have to do away with this system. Many of Americans believe that this is the best way and several have published interesting papers on that topic that may chaneg the minds of people who are still for it. I hope this dream to get rid of the unfair and terrible system that is the Electoral College is accomplished soon. "
62,62,There are advantages to this way of life ,This way of life should be kept up and exercised by our generation and the ones seceding us. 
63,63,but if this is not a face what is it? That's what your thiniking right. We had to find out ,people had many reasons to believe what they believed. Michael Malin had to find out the answer and find out what exaclty made it. That's exaclty what he did. He found out it was just a landform that resembled a face. 
64,64,The author has different details and has found them. ,The author only provides two solutions to the numerous problems that he previously stated. 
65,65,"because you are adding and subtracting only 538 people, but if you are counting from popular votes you would have to add up millions and billions of votes that would be miscounted. If it's miscounted the wrong person could be elected for president.            ","Also, acorrding to the Office of the Federal Register a total of 270 or more electoral votes are needed to elect a president. The total amount of votes consists of 538 electors, meaning there could be a tie in elections. This implys that the system is not fool proof and can have errors. However, if the popular votes were counted more than the electoral votes there would not be any chance of a tie and a president will always be elected. "
66,66,As you can see cell phones are ,"Cell phones today are generally used for many reasons. They may be used for texting, calling, emergencies, and many more reasons. Shocking but true, in this day in time, people need cell phones. Some may be against this matter, but do they know everything besides teens texting everywhere they go? Cell phones are one of the major ways of communicating. "
67,67,"And yet, it is still how president after preseident is put into the Oval Office- sometimes wrongly as explained above. ","The general population, though average citizens, are somtimes not as qualified as Congress to make unbiased, beneficial decisions on behalf of the rest of the country. However, knowing that the next President could be a part of Congress, sometimes sways the decision in favor of a particular candidate. In this paradox of the qualification of Congress and the average citizen, the electoral college is used to fill the void. The electoral college has been used since the founding of the country. The founding fathers of America (George Washington, Ben Franklin, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, etc.)must have developed the electoral college process for some reason. According to the Office of the Federal Register, ""The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" More than anything the electoral college is a mutual and nuetral process that represents something inbetween the biased politics of Congress and the average citizen. The average working class person is the greatest example of American integrity. This person shows that in this great nation, if you set a goal and are willing to work to acheive that goal, it can be acheived. "
68,68,"How would they survive and humans can not. In paragraph nine it discribes how hard it was to even get a picture of this face. If its very hard to get a good glimpse of this image. Its going to be struggle to live and be active on Mars as well. This has to be a natural landform that happens to looks like a face. If someone really did this, they would want credit and all the fame for all their hard work and i think we would have spotted them all ready. ",The two oppsing sides in this argument have evidence to argue their opinion. The belief that the mesa is actually a face is inncorect due to evidence in the article and my essay. Mesa's are common in the area the picture was taken and the face was caused by shadows along with a low quality camera. Whichever side you are on I believe I have brought forth enough evidence to change your opinion or strengthen your opionion that there was no alien lifeforms yet found on Mars. 
69,69,"It might even make some people turn against their country, but that only goes for the people who are really into politics and voting and things of that nature. People say you can't complain if you don't vote, but if they take that perivlage away, I'm sure you'll be hearing even more complaining than if people have the right to vote, but even so, this up and coming generation isn't really into voting anyways, but it should be avalable regardless.

70,70,Other teenagers might think that it is all fun and games ,"Most students parents have and office job. The average work time is from 9am to 5pm, and school gets out at around 2pm- 4pm, so most kids are left unsupervised for around 2-6 hours. Kids left alone can get into all sorts of trouble and can be persuaded to do things that they know they should not do. Kids can be convinced to do drugs, join gangs, and vandalize public property. Instead of doing these things they can be supervised at school doing something that is fun and enjoyable instead of being mischievous. The school environment would be much safer because students wouldnt be influenced be other people to do any bad things, so they would not be doing or selling drugs and they would not be in or associated with a gang. Therefore, students would not bring in bad things into our schools. "
71,71,This a one time offer. You don't know how long this opperation will be running. ,"Have you ever seen the ones in movies? Normal mininmun wage people could never afford these vehicals.

Sooner or later all of the vehials could cost over $50,000 and a lot of people have trouble making that much money over a span of 2-4 years. "

73,73,Students should have the same rights as teachers or any adults. The constitution says that all people are created equal. That should give students the right to bring cell phones to school ,I believe that the school cell phone policy should be that all students should have their cell phones off at all times at school 
74,74,i mean yes theres alot of bandwagon fans and people who really have no idea of whats going on in their country ,"Most people would think ""I could never do that! No one could live like that and still make a living!"" Honestly though, it's been doing the city of Bogota in Colombia, a city comprimised of 7 million citizens a favor. They held a event for only one day evey year since the mid 1990s to improve and ""...promote alternive transportation and reduce smog."" (Paragraph 21, Selsky) Doing this has sparked a revolution of change thoughout the whole city. More people are willing to walk insted of drive to help the enviorment and the place they live in, and the city is giving right back to them! ""Parks and sports centers have also bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut trafic; and new restaruants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" (Paragraph 28, Selsky) "

76,76,In the begin in the story it talks about how she had 83 percent happy and 9 percent digusted smile and 6 percent fearful and 2 percent angry. And that her science teacher had graded her latest lab assignment. And that mona lisa at least according some new computer of showing her emotions. ,"In the passage "" Making Mona Lisa Smile"" the author states in paragraph 6 line 6,""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,""Dr Huang predicts.""then it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor."",this kind of technology can possibly boost testing score and even help children falling behind instead of holding them back another year. The text also states in paragraph 6 line 10 that ;""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communcation,""notes Dr. Huang."". This example actually explains alot of real world issues in the classroom, such as the fact that some students refuse to even try to communicate their confusion or boredom in the classroom so then they often disengage in the lesson and miss every part that would be essential to reaching standards created by the state. "
77,77,That cannot be true becasue if the aliens were hidden we would not have such a great picture of the faces. That completly shows that there is proof that this face is just a natural landform. ,"In conclusion, some people may think there is alien life on Mars because of past picture or conspiracy theories. No one can denty however, that NASA has proven the Face to be nothing but a natural landform on the Red Planet Mars. NASA has proven this by recent pictures, scientific evidence, and real-life examples and measurements. Over the years, NASA has worked hard to figure out the mystery of the face, and just recently they have discovered, with pictyures, evidence, and measruements, that the Face is just a natural landform with unusual shadowing formed on the Red Planet Mars. "
78,78,"No ones life should have to be put on the line to explore a diffrent planet. I personally think its a great idea.

","Overall this article's information and research was great and really did inform me about the planet, but the conclusion ruiened it all. The whole time (paragraphs 1-7) the author lead all the readers to believe that going to Venus has too many dangers and isnt in our best interest, yet the conclusion stated that going to Venus would be a great oppurtunity and that ""Our travels on earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"". If the passage had evidence all throught that going to Venus is beneficial, it would be a perfect article but i was all around confused when I found out the author was all for going to Venus and it ruiened and confused the whole article.

79,79,You have the best food out there too ,"instead of reading a certain amount of books for a grade, they can set a challenge goal like trying to see who could swim the fastest in a certain amount of time, they can record how much tropical foods they have eaten. Another example, when summer starts students can keep record of how many miles they walked or ran. Students can keep track of how many miles they traveled in the summer and at the beginning of the school year they can see who traveled the most and Whoever had the most can get a special prize. Students should design the projects because the students would have a lot more fun doing the project. "

82,82,why i think that we should keep it how it is because is concissed of it concissed of 538 electors and the majority of 270 elector votes is required to elect the president. your state is required to allotment of the electors to equal the number od members in its Congerssional delgation. Under the 23 Amendment the district of columbia is allocated 3 electors. each canidate running for state has the there own group of electors. Electors are genarall choosen by the politial party. you or who ever is voteing helps choose your states electors when you vote. but when you vote for your candidate you ae actually voting for you candidates electors. After the electon there is a Certificate of Ascertainment perpared by the governor listing all of the canidates who ran for President along with the hname sod their electors. ,"Each state gets one vote and then the electors can choose who they want for president. In source two it states that the electoral college consists of 538 electors and the most amont of elecrtoral votes is 270, in order to pick an president. Also in source two it states that the number of electors we have equals to the amount of members of congress we have. I propose a new system by only letting the American people select our president by votes counted all up by each state, for example if we didn't have have electoral college,  then it would be a fair vote because people votes would count the number that adds up with all votes for one candidates that will oppose another candidates and there would be technically no tie it would either ,more or less, but if we still had the electoral college then the vote would not be equally fair becuse if the majority of a state for examlpe  chose republican candidate, then that would be vague becuse some people choose democratic and there vote did not really count. but without the electoral collge, than everyones vote counts and each candidates gets vote from every one, not only electoral. "
83,83,"if we go to the second planet from the sun the gravity would be more tense and would have different affects on humans. the gravity on venus would pull them down more than earth because it is closer to the sun by two planets away. but we also need to think about the air and the atmosphere because if we just go there then we might die. the air on venus is un supportive to humans and the water is not there or it might be a type of water that if you drink it it will kill you. the storms on venus are acid storms, the rain is acid. so i think the only reason why the author is saying that venus is a challenge is because not only the facts above. but also that the fact is that on the serface, temperetures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit. and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we humans experience on earth. so he also might be saying that it might be a challenge because if we take a rocket, it might be torn apart if we dont have the right mesurements. ","Besides this, Venus is at times the closest planet to Earth as ""Earth, Venus and Mars, our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds. These differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus,"" (2). This could be extremely beneficial to both the inhabitants of earth and for future space travel because Venus will sometimes be our ""nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel,"" (4). All of these statements and claims that the author make support his/her claim that the exploration of Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it entails as they are quite literally explaining to their readers why exploration is as important as it is. This tactic has the ability to make audiences aware of the importance of such a mission, and hopefully persuade them to agree. "
84,84,The NASA has only one particularly compeliing to study whats beyond what people dont see or dont know for hummans can travel to other plants ,"Even if the cameras used to take these pictures weren't of the highest quality, said cameras would have been able to at least catch some photos of further signs of life. Things such as houses or buildings, for example. Now, if some one would like to argue that the aliens lived in caves or other natural formations of the sort, how would those people like to argue the fact that there are no visible creatures in any photos?

Astronmers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life. Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth.

122,122,"To commence the third reasoning let another question be asked: First, say for example that you work a double-shift, full-time, day and night just to keep food on your childrens' and wifes' plate, clothes on their backs, and a roof over their heads. When the bills roll in, your paycheck isn't won't arrive for weeks and you still haven't enough to pay, so you may have to work overtime if possible or pick up another job. No one gets rich off the government clearly, and yet we work so hard to just make it. Now here's the question: Doesn't it all feel worth it when the paycheck come in? Okay now for the deeper question: What is the sense or feeling you specifically get when you see you happy families' faces? Now for the point: Our work pays off. We work for the government (at least most of us does) together, whether to put bread on the table or otherwise. Now wouldnt it give us that sense of freedom that us hard workers get to make great decisions like these? It would.

Add three hours to the mix and I am going to bed at 11:00, giving me only six hours to sleep. Not seven, not eight, not nine, and certainly not ten. Following a routine where there is only time for six hours of sleep decreases concentration, slows thinking, damages memory, and can even stunt growth during puberty. Generic_School students cannot simply adapt to the new conditions. No middle school student can. That is why Generic_School students should not have to chronically attend extracurricular activities because it hurts students more than it helps them. "

People can be the complete oppisate of that and it couldn't be good on other people, But people can also be like Mono Lisa and it makes the inviornment a better place knowing people are happy and not sad, discusted and angry.

130,130,"If a student if feeling strong emotions such as saddness or fear; they need to talk to a friend about it, someone they can trust, not a computer. ","While school is a vaulable place to learn new information and facts, it is really a place for children to grow and become more independent and better human beings. While grades matter, the emotional and pyschological health of a student is far more valuable. The FACS technology could act as an army of school counselers. High School and Middle School students tend not to share their emotions, even with their parents. FACS could idntify students that are emotionally troubled, have depression, contemplate self harm or even have mental illness. Once students like these are identified then counselers and social workers could step in, allowing for students to be helped. Right now students that struggle with these issues do not share their feelings. They do not get help and carry on like they are fine. While many may turn out to be okay, even one taking their own life or somebody's else, is too much. While FACS may not be able to help or eliminate all signs of emotional distress, it can surely make a difference. Another benfit of using FACS is that it reads emotoins silently. Students don't have to potray a certain emotion for the technology to understand what they are really feeling. If a studnet is asked how they are, they probably give a surface level, I am fine, answer. The technology reads through that completely, eliminating awkard one on one conversatoins with conselers, and allowing for all students to be reached. "

132,132,NASA would be making our living situations a lot easier to handle of Venus by creating all of this new technology today in this age/era ,"NASA's advancements for Venus exploration are promising, ""For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such chaos,"" (7). Humans would not be able to use the most advanced technology, but durability is the goal, ""By comparison, systems (mechanical computers that use gears and levers to calculate) that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces,"" (7). If humans were to only hover over Venus, the possibilites are limited. Humans and technology have to be as close as possible. Technology that could last for a few weeks is enough to vastly expand our knowledge. Mechanical computers are now obsolete, but in Venus would be a valuable tool, just like the other electonics being made. Researchers have worked tirelessly to continue making Venus exploration a reasonable reality. "

With this in mind, if students were able to be introduced and subject to this technology, there could be future scientist that want to further improve this technology and, until then, would be more involved in it's place at school. (D'Alto 1). Also, due to the fact that this technology is not only limited to the classroom, it is then evident that other jobs could be produced out of this technology being in the classroom, sparking interest in young and vulnerable students. As the author includes, ""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive--for video games or video surgery,"" it is showsn just exactly how various the fields are that this technology could be used in. (D'Alto 6). Whether a kid is devoted to learning about medicne or engrossed in playing games, it has been shown that this technology in the classrooms would expose these kids to it's capabilities and potentially create a passion. (D'Alto 6). Therefore, by including this technolgy in the classroom with it's own purpose, the students would be subject to technolgy that is blooming in several fields and could easily inspire a child to become something that utilizes this technology in their future.

And, had NASA really claimed that the Face was an object built by otherworldly life, surely someone would let the cat out of the bag. Not to mention that, if the vast majority of NASA believed it was an alien monument, do you really think that they would wait eighteen years to investigate the subject again? On top of all of this, it's simply illogical that aliens would create such a thing. As far as we all know, the supposed ""aliens"" on Mars have never come in contact with a human, much less seen one. That only leaves possible explanation; aliens created a monument that of which coincedentally resembles a human head. An absolute coincedence. "

If you are reconsidering the cell phone policy, I believe the second one is the only way to go. Children in this school may sneak their cell phones into class without the teacher ever knowing if they are not banned. This will also lead to students doing poorly in class because they won't be paying attention to the teacher. Also, the use of cell phones in a wrong way can cause a student to get hurt. Overall, I believe your second policy to ban cell phones in class is the best choice because after being a student in school, I know what will happen if they are allowed in school. "

170,170,The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College is because it eceeds the presidents votes. Most states have a winner take all method to figure out who represents your state. It would work but it would be very different then our old presidentual voting. ,"According to source one, ""What Is The Electoral College?"", each political party has it's own set of electors that equal the amount of congressional delegates per state. Usually each state has a ""winner-take-all"" method, so the presidential candidate that gets majority in your state will get all of the electors that represent their party, not just most of them. This is beneficicial to the outcome of the election becuase it makes the ability for a candiate to get majority vote much simpler. There is less of a possibility of a tie, or an outcome where no candidate wins. Source 3, ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep out despised method of choosing president"", states that ""even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state..."" , therefore allowing the candidate to secure all votes to their side, instead of having the votes divided on the line of majority rule, and causing rifts between Electoral College voters.

He supports his ideas with evidence and also the analysis he has with his knowledge by research. He uses facts, and not a lot of opinions to express his ideas and belief that Venus is a worthy pursuit.

173,173,"Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO, in their time , agreed on? Abolishing the electoral college. Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for the slate of electors, who in turn elect the president.  Who picks the electors? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party's central comittee, sometimes the presidentail canidates themselves. Voters can't controls whom their electors vote for. Well not always .Voters sometimes get very confused about the votes in vote for the wrong canidate.  The best arguement against the electoral college is called Disater Factor. The Americans should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election in a century. Back in 1960, segregations in Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratics with new electors that would oppose John F. Kennedy.  The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the canidates who recieve the most votes. A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible, it happened in 2000, but it's less likely than a dispute over popular vote.  The Electoral College requires a presidential Canidate to have trans-regional appeal. No other region ( South, Northwest, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. The winner takes all method of awarding electoral votes. The electoral College avoids the problems of elections in which no canidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. For an example, nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes.           ","As you can see I am in favor of changing the elctoral college to election by popular vote for the president of the United States of America. Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all agreed on one thing, and it was aboloshing the Electoral College. Under the Electoral College System they vote not for the president but for a state of electors who in return elect the president. Last but not least, the Electoral College is just unfair in so many differnt ways. These are reasons why I am not in favor of the Electoral College but in the favor to elect by popular vote for the president of the United States of America.      "
174,174,"Anybodyvoted on who you wanted to win it go can cheat the number of votes to change the president they are voting for. With the Electoral College you can't do that because,  once you voted who you want to win, it get sent out tothe electors. Who from that point on count how many voted for both of them and decide a winner. ","A lot of voters who are not very well educated may not even understand what the electoral college is or what they are actually voting for when they vote. Instead of voting for the candidate that they want as the next president, they are voting for a group of electors that decide who will win. Sometimes, the electors that are assigned to that candiadate will not vote for them. This process also seems to disriciminate against the less populated states because they don't have as much a say in the college and are often forgoten in the rush of propaganda and aren't really aware of who they should pick and why they should pick them.

The electors are generally chosen by the candidates political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are. The president only haves four years, it is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. When you vote for your state they have a thing called winner-take-all system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of proportional representation. When the election is done they have a thing they do called Certificated of Ascertainment it lists all of the candidates who ran for president in your state along with the names of their respective electors.

In this statement the Office is stating on how whichever party a person might be in, the electoral college will come through.

If the state that a person might live in is Democrat then the electoral college will go for that party, and same thing for the Republican party. "

181,181,"The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as acompromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by popular vote of quilified citizens. Your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation, one for each member in the House of Representatives plus  two for your Senators. The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. You help choose your state's electors when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors. The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year. Your state's Certificates of Ascertainments are sent to the Congress and the National Archives as part of the official records of the presidential election. At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states the know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on thje tight  races in the ""swing"" sates. During the 2000 camaign, seventeen states din't see the candidates at all, inckuding Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters inn 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad. If anyone has a good argument for putting the fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in Ohio, they have yet to make it. The electoral College requires a presindential candidates to have trans-regional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Rommey was in the South, has no incentive to campaing heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win. This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a succesful president. The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised, to feel that their votes do not count, that the new president will have no regard for their interests, that he really isn't their president.    ",Do you know what the Electoral College is? It's a process that the founding fathers established in the Constitution as a compromise between election of President by a vote in Congress and election of President by popular vote of qualified citizens.

","Multiple times, the author delves into a side-topic as opposed to continuing on with the topic of Venus exploration. They start off the article with two sentences that have no relation to the story, yet confuse readers. The sentences are about Venus' nickname, the ""Evening Star"", and how even though it is a planet, it is still called this. This is completely irrelevant to exploration, as everyone knows it is a planet, and the ""Evening Star"" name is never mentioned again. Later on in the passage, the author rambles on about World War II-age computers and how they functioned properly even before the digital age. Once more, this is slightly irrelevant and does not contribute to the story at all except to add another paragraph instead of focusing on the specifics of how NASA is using them to help with Venus. "

When citizens vote for president they are actually voting for a member of the Electoral College that is going to select their president, rather than the citizens voting for the president themselves. The Electoral College is made of 538 electors, the number of electors from each state varies depending on the states Congressional delegation.

""Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote..""(Posner). So these Electoral College followers agree with the electors actually selecting the winner because they don't have to do anything. People can just sit back and watch the electors take the power, while the others do nothing but be slumps. In source one, the Office of the Federal Register mention that ""when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors."", which means that if voters have friends in the position of an elector, voters might just vote for the elector because theres nothing else to really pay attention to.

The Electoral College is a huge part of this process also, and to destroy that would be heartbreaking for the nuerotics that can't stand any change in routine. If the Electoral College were to be abolished, and popular vote was to be instigated throughout the country, any semblance of a schedule would be torn away. Problems would spring up all over the place, and everything would all go to hell. Instead of recounts for counties, whole states would need recounts. If a populous state like Texas were to need a recount, never mind a week, a month wouldn't be enough time to recount it all perfectly. The government would be stuck without a leader, and worst case scenario, the United States of America could be put in a state of anarchy by the end of the decade.

By driving less, we can reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. ""Paris bans driving due to smog,"" by Robert Duffer, is a prime example of the reduction of air pollution after limiting car usage. ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"", writes Duffer. One Friday, the smog of Paris ""rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world"". On the following Monday, motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a $31 fine. After only one day with less cars on the roads, the smog had nearly dissappeared. This shows that even a day with less cars can make a huge difference in the amount of air pollution. Rosenthal's article, "" The End of Car Culture"", states that many sociologists believe that if the pattern of less cars continues, ""it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment"" because transortation is America's second largest sourse of carbon emissions. Less air polution is a very important advantage of less cars.  "

If you were to look at the photo furthest to the left, you would assume that it resembled a face, but If you compair that photo to the one taken twenty-five years later, you would begin to understand that to photo was out-dated and that the camera was not as clear as the one taken later. In addition, why would an alien make a structure of a human's face.  "

The United States of America, born and based off of popular soverignty, should be just  that ; decided by the people.

It's true that they have different kinds of emotions but what if it is fake? ,"Life contains many differences, includes positive and negative things, truthful or untruthful. Some people said emotions are never lie. We could figure out the statue of someone by looking at their face, and that's true. However, life is something really complicated, sometimes things in front of you don't mean like what you think. Likewise, even though the expression from people face is the most authenic, when they are trying to hide their feelings, we literally cannot know their real emotions. The changing of teenager is issue that causes headache for parents, their characters aren't the same like before, their emotions are changed. Both of them could not find the common speech, and push them further each other. That is the moment, the childrens easily fall in the darkness. For real instance, children or students aren't agree about their parent's thinking, or the education from school completely. Most of them don't say it out, or talk back.

My guess is not very often.  ,"Another example of how seeking multiple people's advice can help you make a better decision is If you were debating whether or not to end a friendship. You would most likely want your other friends advice on what to do. Chances are you would go to multiple different friends and ask them for advice on what to do. If you were to just ask for one of your friends opinions, it would be less accurate than asking for five of your friends opinions. Your one friend that you asked could be prejudice against your other friend, and give you a false, or bias, opinion. "

Along with the sensors the radar will help with the antilock system to make that dream come ture.  BMW has already annouced the development of ""Traffic Jam Assistant"". It's a car the can handle driving up to 25 mph, but touch sensors keeps the driver holding the wheel in case of a malfunction.

It saves time for electors and it gives people a chance to see who they are really voting for. Presidents would have to go to each state and appeal to them in order to get a vote. I belive that is what we need. They would be required to actually work for a position in office rather than speaking on whjat they are going to do and paying someone else to elect them. We should have faith in our president and know who we are voting for before we cast our vote. This system seems more fair and more modern to the twenty first century. This is a system most Americans would agree with.

Citizens of the United States of America have not exactly chosen to not use cars, but some have, the main reason Citizen of America have limited themself is due to a lack of money. During our ""recession"" Americans were ""unemployed"" and ""unable to pay (The end of car culture 32)."" Because citizens were not able to pay for cars, they did not use them, thus as you get adapted to a new situation you tend to stay with it.

231,231,They talk about what they going to bring and how far it is and what they are going to be doing. in the passage he talked about what happen in the war and how did it affect . and maybe having electronics up there too. ,"In the article, the author continously offers alternatives for exploration. He does this is paragraphs' 5,6, and 7 where he gives examples of organizations that are working towards this exploration. However in all of the paragraphs, the author seems to only be giving ""what if"" scenarios or in some cases just simple ideas that have been thought about and are possibly being examined. He fails to provide any real data or statistics for these things, except when he mentions the simplified electronics in paragraph 7. Even then, those devices are only able to survive for 3 weeks, so it would still take many years to just improve those devices. Also, in paragraph 6 the author states, ""Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus"". This statement is very broad, and it does not key in on any form of information that should lead us to believe that to be true. These details from the passage prove my point on the amount of years it would take, as well as the fact that nobody has any idea how long. The question to be asked here is, ""Is it worth the wait?"". For these reaons I stand behind my claim that the author supported the idea of exploring venus very poorly.  "

234,234,"First, I would like to say that this is a really good topic the author brings forth to the table, ",I believe the author is trying to say that Venus is worth exploring to see if it is able to be like Earth once more 
235,235,"In paragraph 4 the author tells us even though Venus's surface had conditions five times more extreme than what we see on Earth, long ago it was covered with large oceans, rocky sediment and craters. If Venus's conditions used to be so similar to Earth then could it possibly have supported life? ","The author explains points in Venus' history that have intrigued astronomers, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largelyt with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, "" (4). Besides having been closer to Earth's ""twin"" many years ago, Venus may be more similar than humans thought, shown through ""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters,"" (4). Studying Venus could lead to us knowing why this planet is such a far cry from Earth now, and this could provide valuable with how humans interact with their environment. If Venus has such similar features to Earth, like valleys, then there is probably more to discover on Venus' surface. This peculiar connection between this planet and Venus shows how valuable exploration could prove, just as Venus' proximity further supports how worthy of a pursuit Venus is. "
236,236,These facts lead to the evidence is many ways ,"Bias can be hard to detect in many cases, especially when the thing biased to is smaller and less prevalent. Research done by the California Critical Thinking and Development Organization, 72% of people were unable to identify bias in articles. For what seems like such a simple skill, it is surprising in the amount of people who are unable to preform it. Taking to multiple sources makes bias easier to identify, because more conflict will occur in the information. One source may leave out information to angle the evidence, while the other states all the evidence. Even in cases where bias in unavoidable, taking to multiple sources may provide better results. As Generic_Name, a researcher for the University of Oklahoma states, ""Researching biased topics may prove challenging, but combining evidence together to rid the bias is a helpful strategy in reducing the nonfactual information.""

These deaths and accidents from distracted driving with your phones can be very managed. If people were to follow the law of not using them in the car and to be more careful then these outrages percentages will become more and more less. Also, I would like to express the fact that there are many options in vehicles that allow you to use your devices via Bluetooth and voice control. So, if there was an emergency you can answer and talk on the phone without even having to pick up your phone and looking away. This concludes my essay I strongly believe in not using your devices while driving and I hope to have expressed the effect is has. "
239,239,"In paragraph 6 the author uses the exmple of how we could use this new technology during school for example he wrote, ""If you smile when a web ad appears on you screen a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, th next ad might be different."" ","The information gathered from students could be used for selfish purposes, as explained in the sixth passage of the article, ""if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different,"" showing that companies have use for this technology to better their businesses. If ad companies managed to get this emotional information from students all across the country, either from the government itself or through illegal actions, they could use that information to make new products and ads that would try to exploit the emotions of children. Because of this and the added concern of giving the information to the government itself, many parents would oppose a system that tracks and records the emotions of children. "
240,240,because it's a place where we vote on President and Vice President ,"The Electoral College is a method of voting for President and Vice President that was produced by our founding fathers in the articles of the Constitution. The Electoral College has been in use for centuries, but it is time that we disregard it. "
241,241,It's quite simply one vote makes one person win the presidentcy. ,"If two candidates receive the same number of electoral votes and tie in an election, the House of Representatives then chooses the president, while the Senate choose the vice president, but their votes may not show who voters want as president, seeing that voters often vote one party for president while the other for their representatives (Plumer 12). The vote for president is distributed unevenly, and states with many voters will only be represented by one vote. this could lead to the House of Representatives choosing a president that is only liked by a small population and this cannot easily be undone. Swing states are the only thing that can cause or prevent a tie in elections, and a tie has almost occured in 1976 in Hawaii and in 1968 in Ohio. "
242,242,The Electoral College consists of 538 electors the majority only 270 votes is required for the final dessision. Each candidate running for the president has his or her own group of electors but the state law varys how many are selected. The presidential election is held every four yearson the tuesday after the first monday of november.  The states are called districts for example the word state also refers to the disrict of Columbia. ,"Each state gets one vote and then the electors can choose who they want for president. In source two it states that the electoral college consists of 538 electors and the most amont of elecrtoral votes is 270, in order to pick an president. Also in source two it states that the number of electors we have equals to the amount of members of congress we have. I propose a new system by only letting the American people select our president by votes counted all up by each state, for example if we didn't have have electoral college,  then it would be a fair vote because people votes would count the number that adds up with all votes for one candidates that will oppose another candidates and there would be technically no tie it would either ,more or less, but if we still had the electoral college then the vote would not be equally fair becuse if the majority of a state for examlpe  chose republican candidate, then that would be vague becuse some people choose democratic and there vote did not really count. but without the electoral collge, than everyones vote counts and each candidates gets vote from every one, not only electoral.

245,245,By doing a Facial Action Coding to a classroom full of students would be different and interesring ,"Based on the evidence given in the article, the use of Facial Action Coding Stystems in the classroom would be wildly valuable. The computer can detect many levels of emotion to accomodate their program to the students' needs. If a particular lesson bores a student or that student has lack of focus, the computer can adjust and change many aspects of thier layout to catch the student's attention. Also, students can receive the correct level of work- whether that be too easy or too hard. And not only can students benefit, but teachers, as well. They can track student progress to further accomodate their needs. While technology can be used for many unethical things, the Facial Action Coding System would be extremely effective in a school setting.     "
246,246,"This means that the larger the state (in population, not size), the more their overall vote weighs ","Every state gets a minimum of 3 electoral votes, and then more are added depeding on the size of the state's population.  WIth 3 votes for a population of 500,000, Wyoming has more votes per citizen than the larger states do.  Large states with ten of millions of people may have only a few more votes than Wyoming does, giving it's individual citizens more power in choosing the President.  "
247,247,"By keeping the Electoral College, we will be able to express our different political references. ","Most people hear the word ""Electoral College"" and think that it is a place.. But they're wrong, it is a process. The Electoral College is widely regarded as a thing that seems to belong to the past and not to fit in the present. The advocates whom are conflicting with others are saying that the Electoral College method isn't democratic in modern day society, which is correct. The Electoral College is a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens which was founded by the founding fathers.

Every year a new generation becomes legal to vote and be part of the election but if they dont know how to vote or how it works then they wont be able to. Some people dont know anything about poitics but, still want to be able to vote so, it should be easy for them to vote for who they want to be president rather then the long process of, voting for the canidates elector and most of the time they dont vote for who they want and they vote for the wrong person.         "

He knows that hundreds of thousands of candidates apply each year, but only a small number of people are accepted.

Generic_Name told him that with his work ethic, he would surely get fired during his first week of the job.

253,253,in the u. s. it is a law that you have to have your phone down from your hands while driving or at least have a Bluetooth device that can connect to your phone to your car so you don't have to look at your phone to call or answer a call while your driving a car ,"The new ""hands free"" law is a law where no one can hold their phone while driving. This has effected people with older cars and even newer cars to this day. As this law is in set, people have to connect their phone to Bluetooth to be able to talk on the phone. For example, if you're driving and someone calls, you have to have your phone connected to Bluetooth to be able to talk. In some cases this can be bad for the driver and other people driving on the road also. If your phone isn't connected to Bluetooth while you're driving, there can be a high risk of a crash when you're connecting your phone to Bluetooth. In some cases, there could also be an emergency call you have to answer, and people that don't have Bluetooth in their car can be effected by this law "

So remember always be fair especially if it's about phones everyone again I'm going to say everyone loves their phones. I would take in to consideration that you would select policy 1  ,. Lets say that students are in class and they feel the urge to text because they have not used the phone that day. They will want to use it in class but they will do it secretly so the teacher wont take it away. For example there was this kid in my class and while we were in the middle of the lesson he would take out the phone while the teacher had her back to us and start using it. If you put the policy that will let us use our cell phones in school during lunch periods and free time then we will have enough texting done so that we will not need to text anymore until school is finished or until their next free time. 
257,257,"the challenge of exploring venus is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot. however, this nickname, is misleading since venus is actually a planet.

While venus is simple to see from the distant but safe ventage pointof Earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely.  MY ESSAY.  The callenge of exploring venus is one of the biggest points of light in the night sky, these differences is speed mean that sometimes we are closer to mars and others times to venus. Because venus is sometimes right aroundthe corner in space terms humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud draped world A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent dioxide blankets venus. Also notable, venus has the hottest surface temperature af any planet in our solar system, even though mercury is closer to our sun. astronomers are fascinated by venus because it may well once have been the most Earth like planet in our solar system. long ago, venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. Today, venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such ass valleys, mountains, and craters. Imagine a blimp like behicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling venusian landscape. However, peering at venus from a ship orbiying or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions bacuse most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendiring standard forms of photography and videography ineffective.

260,260,"The Electoral College has a consist selection of the electors, the meeting of electors where they can vote for President and Vice President, and counting electoral votes by congress.  The Electoral College has 538 electors, and majority of 270 electoral votes that is required to elect the presedent. Also, under the 23rd amendment of the constitution, the distric of columbia is allocated 3 electors and treated like a state for this reason, the word ""state"" also refers to district of columbia.  Plus, the presidential election is held every 4 years on a Tuesday after the first Monday of in November, and when you choose your states electors when you vote for president, you also are actually voting for your candidates electors. After the presidential election, the governor of your state prepares a listing of all the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors called, ""Certificate of Ascertainment"".  Your state also sends a Certificates of ascertainment to the Congress and National Archives as part of the official records of thee presidential election. The Electoral College is also a widely regarded as an anachronoism, which is a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by the candidates who recieved the most popular votes the winner.  This positions are correct in arguing that the Electroal College method is not democratic in modern sense, but it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When people vote for the president they are actually voting for a state of electors. ","The Electoral College has served us for more than a century in determining our nation's new president. ""The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress,"" states the article ""What Is the Electoral College?"" written by the Office of the Federal Register. This means that we do not vote directly vote for our new president, but instead vote for electors that vote for a candidate running for office. Though many individuals are in favor of keeping the Electoral College, if kept, it will continue to cause problems in our nation. "

So maybe it was there fault, all I'll tell you this, they were not very lucky ","The article ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" written by Bradford Plumer states, ""The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the sytem allows for much worse. Consider that state legislators are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people"". This means that the people never know if their electors are going to go back on their word and vote for another candidate. "
263,263,striving to meet the challenge presented by venus has value. because human curiosty will likely lead us into many equally intimidating enveavors. travelers on earth and beyond should not be limited by danger to explore venus more. venus should be expanded to help meet the edges of imagination and inovation.  ,"The author supports their claim by giving numerous details and supporting his ideas.""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endbeavors."" A big issue that is brought up are the harsh conditions Venus brings. ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Farenheight, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" Knowing this, you might think that they must stop there with their research because there's no way they can discover Venus now because it's to dangerous and harsh. That is false, ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray."" Their solution is to have a vehicle hovering over Venus that would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. It would still be toasty but not deathly. The author claims, "" Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" The author supports his claim by saying yes, the temperature is a challenge they will face, but NASA has one particular compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus, and they will continue to challenge themselves and find solutions to these conflicts they face.

264,264,but if they think about it instead of waisting your time just guessing what their emotions are you would know if they use the proper techonology. They had made a process that began when the computer constructed a 3-D computer model of the face and it showed that all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles. ,"The human body has way more than just six emotions so getting a high accuracy reading on how you are really feeling is out of the question because FACS uses the a process of a 3-D model Dr. Huang states ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles."" This quote explains that it has to use a way of making a model which can sometimes take some time depending on the processing power of the computer not only that but human emotions can change quite quickly and if the pc doesnt make the model fast enough the computer can easly fail at getting and accuarate reading.

This quote makes it clear to the audience that scientists are doing whatever it takes to develop multiple, efficient plans for space travel. The author also goes onto provide different examples to further convey how close scientists are to developing the safest plan possible. They specifically mention the use of simplified electronics made of silicon carbide and explain how they've already been tested in a chamber that simulate the conditions of Venus's surfaces, yet how they're still being improved upon. They also describe an old technology called mechanical computer, noting how this technology has already been used frequently in the 1940's and how it can be incorporated into space travel now. The author has given detailed descriptions of the efforts made and the options available to provide a safe embarkment for humans to support the ideas that Venus is a worthy pursit. "

My immediate answer was yes because NASA was my dream job even when i was younger i wanted to be in NASA.  ","If you ask someone for advice, they may be able to take something they learned from a choice they had to make. You can apply that to the decision that you need to make. When I was in fifth grade, I was in my last year of Cub Scouts and I was getting ready to cross over into Boy Scouts. I had to choose what Boy Scout troop I wanted to cross over to. I couldn't decide on which one I wanted to go to, so I asked my great uncle, who was a very successful scout, how he decided which troop he wanted to join. He told me to ""find a group of scouts that I would enjoy sharing a meal or a tent with, because if you have that, your time in scouting will be much more enjoyable."" That advice led me to Generic_Name, they were all really nice people, so I ended up joining their troop. Four years later I'm still enjoying Boy Scouts, I've gone on dozens of camping trips, and made some of my best friends. Asking my great uncle for advice was really helpful in that situation. "

275,275,Studying venus would be really interesting but venus is hard to study because it´s dangerous and it has really high pressure.  ,"People have studied the many planets in our solar system and are fastinated by them. People have also studied the solar system to help explore and give information about the planets around us. One planet that scientists have studied for a good amount of time is Venus since it shows that at one time, the planet might have inhabited living organisms. However, Venus is a very dangerous planet since many attempts of landing spacecraft has failed on Venus and the clouds of the planet are made of sulfuric acid. Venus is not worth the pursuit of knowledge since the planet has a very dangerous enviorment for humans and that not a single spacecraft has landed safely on the planet and returned. "

","Emotion is in the brain, not the heart. The way the FACS understands emoion is simple. It maps out a 3-D model of the face, looks at the shape and positoin of all the muscles, then it associates the different facial movements with differet emotion. For example, your orbicularis oris (muscles around your mouth) tighten your lips to show when you are angry. It even works when a person it trying to mask emotions. During a fake smile, the zygomatic major stretches the mouth sidways, while in a real smile the zygomatic major lifts the corners of the mouth. These examples can show how science IS able to understand emotoin, probaly better than most humans. Arguments that use that falshood, that science is unable to understand emotion, is completly false.

278,278,I honestly think it has been made up by an illusion. ,"Some of the biggest tricks played are constructed by the eyes. When the first image of the face on Mars was revealed, the features such as the eyes and nose were most likely created by shadows.

282,282,"If we used democracy, only 51% of voters would be needed. But with Electoral Votes, it keeps little states from having too much power and say. ","It only makes sense that the larger states with a larger population should get more of a say in their government, and recieve more electoral votes than a small state with fewer people. With this system political infulence is restored to the larger states making the canidates focuss on the more populous areas. More power to the more populous states also means that run-off elections are avoided. In 1992 and in 1968 run-off elections were avoided due to the use of the Electoral College; ""Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority of the Electoral College"" P.22. A run-off election extreamly complicates the election process however the chance of this happening is greatly reduced when using the Electoral College which almost always produces a clear winner. "

At the end of the day it is still your choice to make, regardless of what anyone thinks or says. There are an endless amount of decisions that people seek personal opinions on no matter how serious. When you're going out to eat with a group you ask them where they want to go. The NFL or NBA Most Valuable Player isn't chosen by just one person, it's asked about by fans, coaches, and players to see who the majority thinks deserves it.

They vote for who they believe would lead our society and modern day world in the right direction.

That is better way to improve skills. Students become work hard and study hard. They will get good job. ","It decreases the time to finish work at home rather than at school. Most online school programs offer as much time as you need on an assignment. Although, once you've started one there is of course, a deadline. Attending online school at home is very benefitial in this reason because it would make it easier for the student. On that note, if a student were to be having trouble with an assignment online they would be able to turn it in once they have understood it completely or if not the student could move on to another subject and come back to it. That is what makes online school at home very helpful and beneficial. In a classroom that would not be possible, in some cases, they would have no other choice but to turn it when needed to and accept the consequences. "
293,293,A dispute over the outcome of an electoral college vote is possible it happened in 2000 but its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote the reason is that the winning candidates share of the electoral college invairably exceeds his share of the popular vote in 2012's election for example Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney .  . . . because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner take all basis even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral vote victory in that state A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes 538 is an even number but it is higly unlikely .....  ,Certainty of outcome: A dispute over the outcome of an electoral college vote is possible-it happend in 2000-but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular group.

297,297,its a good process and it keeps us from having the problem of elections in which no candidates receives a majority of the votes cast. ,"In an election their really is a process of voting and voting again. Instead of couting the number of people who want a certain president and so on. We are viewed as a state and some states having more say than other even if the votes are in the same margin. This is the reason why some states are focused on more by the candidates and are heavily educated on the topic and given more attention than smaller states whose votes wont change much. an even bigger problem is te fact that most states operate on a winner-take-all basis so even a slight majority vote one way will give that person all of the votes. A very worrying prospect as expressed in source two is the possibility of a tie. in which the election would be given to the house of representatives. Each state only gets on vote so a representative representing 500,000 people would have as much say as representatives representing 35 million people. "
298,298,"The things that are wrong with use the electoral college is that is the person gets their votes for thir state the might just win because, the more the people that live there more of the votes that they might get.

If there was no Electoral College, the votes that they put in could contribute to the greater pool of that parties voters, while with Electoral College the votes are pointless and basically disapear. That, to me, is robbing the citizens of the U.S. of thir right to vote. According to Richard A. Posner, the Electoral College restores some of the weight that the large states hold in a presidental election. However, the large states may not have all of one party and those other votes can really make a difference. "

","In the novel,  Educated, by Tara Westover, Tara's family did not allow her to go to public schools that were endorsed by the government. Instead, Tara was home schooled, inconsistently, by her mother, through her middle school years; but she primarily worked with her brothers and father in a junkyard. Westover and her family lived a simple, somewhat poor lifestyle in the mountains of Utah. Some families suffer from the same burdens and need their children to work on the farm or in the shop with them. Rather than quitting school altogether, the children could take online courses to receive the education required to build a better life for themselves, while at the same time, helping their family.  In the same way, not only would online courses allow students to fulfill duties to the family, such as working, students can also prioritize their hobbies and ambitions;. For example, in this generation, common teenagers gain fame and fortune from becoming social media influencers. This requires them to travel for meet and greets with fans, have tours, always take pictures, make videos and advertise products. Additionally, some athletes are apart of extremely competitive travel teams that require them to travel often for tournaments and competitions. Such extracurricular activities should not be given up because it interferes with school. Those activities are the passions and hobbies of some individuals and online schooling would allow them to get their education and participate in events they love.  "

Companies involved in this new technology will test the product far before the release of any of their final product. The last thing they want is to have a disaster of driverless car failure. The fact that people support these ideas rather than oppose them shows that the majority of the population will want these vehicles on the street.

304,304,To me I like it if you all would let it be the popular vote not by some college. ,"If I had a choice between keeping the Electoral College or a popular Vote, I would pick a popular vote cause the Electoral College is pretty crashed and it really fair. I say give people a chance and let them vote.  Picking a pedigree plurality of votes from the Electoral College then from the Popular votes isnt fair based on us. No voters vote swings a national election,and in spite of that,about one-half the eligible American population did vote in the election of 2012,as said in pharagraph 23. I think that Voting for the popular vote would be better then Electoral College cause it would be the states vote instead of just a majority of peoples vote that only want a president that is not validated for success for us.

So, if there's a big problem that needs to get solved and the advice of one person isn't working, try one more person, and if that doesn't work, one more, if that doesn't work, keep going until it does, because there's a high chance that someone can help with whatever the problem is, even if it isn't your inner circle of friends or colleagues, the advice that you need could be close by and you could never even realize it, it could be at multiple points nearby, and you could never even know that several people is what you're looking for.

The Electoral College relies on archaic methods to make tallying votes simpler for the government, which results in problems. It's like the government is rounding the votes. The winner-takes-all method of the Electoral College can render a voter's vote completely useless, and it even allows representatives to vote for the presidential candidate that is against the voter's wills. Presidential candidates will not bother campaigning in states that are loyal to their adversary or are too small to be worth their time.

326,326,"It keeps a steady stream when it comes time to vote because aslong as someone had 270 votes you know thats who will get picked. so why try changing that and have a whole new system put in and then not know what to do when it comes time to vote.

I think its fair that they have it set at 270 for voting that way everyone havs a chance to vote instead of it being so low that only a few people get to vote before they shut it down because they have reached there number of tallys that they need.  So if they change the number of tallys that a president needs to become president that will be stupid and people will act out on it because they wont think its right, and because the people who didnt vote will not like the fact that they didnt get to put there vote f in before they stoped the voting and because they meet the number that they needed. Its a vote why do they need to title it as a the vote of a president or a popular vote of a president. Why not just vote for there just electors instead of saying vote for your candidate when really you are just voting for the electors. If you are voting for a certin thing there is no reason that u have to re-word it just to vote, if you are voting for something do it the right way instead of changing stuff and making it seem one way when really its the other way. Why should the electoral get just as much as the winning presindent? They are not doing as much as the president  and who is helping him out.. so they should not get the same reword.    ","Since most of the big states already have their votes planned out on who is going to win them over, president-to-be's don't try to persuade them because they know they have those votes. Mostly they try to change the swing states, or the smaller states because they could change from Democratic to Republican during anytime in the election.

Some electors are even faithless in their party's canidate so they dont even vote for them at all! How can we rely on a group of people who dont rely on their party? "

If they go to the national championship they will change to that team. This voting shopuld change to the peoples votes instead of this winner-take-all system. It is more fair and balanced.  Think of it this way in 2012 that more people voted for Mitt Romney but the electors didnt think so that is unfair. Right? The voting needs to be changed once and for all to a popular vote system instead of the Electoral College. This is the best way for the United States to deal with this madness. One solution and you are one step forward to a better Nation.  ,"According to source one, ""What Is The Electoral College?"", each political party has it's own set of electors that equal the amount of congressional delegates per state. Usually each state has a ""winner-take-all"" method, so the presidential candidate that gets majority in your state will get all of the electors that represent their party, not just most of them. This is beneficicial to the outcome of the election becuase it makes the ability for a candiate to get majority vote much simpler. There is less of a possibility of a tie, or an outcome where no candidate wins.

Unlike Earth, Venus has an atmosphere that is ""almost 97percent carbon dioxide"" with a surface temperature averaging ""over 800 degrees Fahrenheit"" and an ""atmospheric pressure [that] is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet""(Paragraph 3). Due to these extreme differences in temperature, pressure, and air content, Venus would be fairly inhospitable for humans. Usually when NASA launches missions to other planets they are trying to find alternatives habitats for the human race in the event that they cannot survive on Earth. If humans will not be able to withstand the conditions of Venus it is no longer a good option; therefore, it is not worth looking into since the author provides evidence that Venus would not be a useful living environment in the future.

NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditiond on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. If you image blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or more miles above the roiling Venusian landscap, it would be a shocker. Temperatures would still be tasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would ber close to the level of the sea and Earth. ","They are considering a blimp-like vehicle that would float above the suface of Venus to meet the challenges presented. This blimp would avoid the poor conditions of the Venusian landscape by floating some thirty miles above the surface. Conditions around the blimp would still be slightly hot, but the pressure and toxicity would be similar to that on Earth. These conditions are not ideal, but they would be sufficient enough to study Venus further. Another one of NASA's ideas is to use mechanical computers to study Venus. These mechanical computers do not require electronics, and they would be more resistant to the poor conditions of the surface. These new innovations in the study of Venus is what makes the dangers tolerable and the study worthy. "

Another thing that lowers the morale is the absence of candidates in states that can't be won very easily. If a candidate is pretty sure he can't win over a state, he won't visit it because it wouldn't be worth his time. He also wil prioritize large states over small ones because they have more electoral votes. All of these can make a state or person feel as if the election isn't really in their hands, and when people feel like their vote doesn't matter, they don't vote. "

379,379,I learned that doing activity's can bring you together with so many people its basicly changing how we act around or with others.  ,"For example, schools have their students build collaboration skills through group projects; online schooling or video conferencing does not provide this same benefit of collaboration. When a student is working from the comfort of their own home, they are not actively collaborating with other students; it is essential for students to have the ability to cooperate with other people in the real world. These group projects add the benefit of teaching students how to work with others in order to get certain tasks done, preparing them for when they have to inevitably work with other people they may not necessarily like. Online schooling is largely independent, and requires the student to rely on themselves and only themselves, while classroom settings teach both independence and dependence. Students must learn how to work with other people so that they can learn how to deal with individuals who are difficult to cooperate with, and so that they learn to rely on others when in need of assistance.

386,386,Online school would be the best choice to many students that just have it the ruff way and not easy. ,"Because classes are taken online, the teacher or instructor utilizes different technological tools and resources for lesson plan and activities. It broadens the possibilities of how information can be delivered to students and the different class work students can participate in. Online classes can also seem a more appealing option to in person classes, as lessons and assignments tend to be more direct and straight forward. Often times, school teachers give ""fluff"" assignments that don't necessarily have a purpose or that don't offer much learning potential. These assignments are given to pass time and give students an activity to do whether in class or for homework. I have endured my share of ""fluff"" assignments throughout high school. During my sophomore year, I despised English class because I didn't seem to gain anything out of it. My teacher would assign miscellaneous assignments such as a food poem or a repetitive packet of work. Online classes tend to include less of these ""fluff"" assignments because they differ from traditional in person classes where students meet personally with teachers. There is less of a worry to keep students occupied with different assignments each class. With the Generic_School Online Campus, students are given assignments to complete each week with the due date at the end of that week. Teachers tend to give less unnecessary assignments because the class can be more spread out throughout the course. "
387,387,"The reason why people go out to vote, is because they have a specific person in mind. Although throughout election time, many people are brought to different conclusions that one candidate is better then the other, or they both have their flaws yet, they strongly represent one thing the other candidate dispises. Either way, there are those types of people who just cannot decide. They may be left undecided, and have changed their minds by the time it's ready to vote ","because when a state feels like they have a chance of having their candidate win, they put more thought into the vote they cast knowing that their vote counts. Having voters put more thought into their votes instead of not caring as much gives the better candidate a greater chance of winning, if one candidate was truly better than the other. The more thoughtfull canidates in a swing state will pull more information from the candidates campaigns. Popular vote does not use the winner takes all method so the idea of swing states will no longer have any effect in the election. "

392,392,"In the second sentance of the fourth paragraph it explains that astronomers are curious because it may have been the most Earth like planet in our solar system. The planet resembles a surface with rocky sediment and includes things such as valleys, mountains, and craters.  In the fifth paragraph it states that NASA is coming up with possible solutions to avoid most of these issues. One of them is inventing is a small vehical that resembles a blimp floating 30 miles above Venus's landscape.  ","The Earth comes right after Venus in the solar system, making it fairly close given the long time frame of space travel.

Venus also ""has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters"" (Paragraph 4). In the event that Venus became a viable option for humans to inhabit when Earth collapses (as mentioned earlier), humans would have already been exposed to some of the landscape there. Although this would make Venus more assimilable, its similarity to Earth does not outweigh the dangers that still come with the planet being an unknown land changing from its previous state. With this evidence the author provides an advantage to exploring Venus, but it does not hold up against the established points about Venus' overall uninhabitability. "

395,395,"The single best argument against the electoral collage is what might be what we (the american people) might call the disastor factor, We should consdier ourselves lucky that in the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a centry; the system can allow much worse.

402,402,The reason I think that the voting regulations is broken is that smaller states like Rhoad Island is a state that gets 3-10 votes and Claifonia gets 55 votes. If the only thing that make people happy is to be heard by the bigger people in life. If you where a 18 year old kid in a small state trying to make a  new product that could help millions but your in that state that wont let you be heard by the rest of the country.    ,"It also means that larger states have the advantage, because they get more votes, like California (55), Texas (38), and Florida (29), while smaller states get less, such as Alaska (3), Rhode Island (3), and Hawaii (4). Just to add insult to injury, this means that larger states are more fought over by politicians, leaving smaller states practically ignored. This is unfair to people in the Dakotas or Montana have no information to base their votes on, instead just picking a canidate by mainly party affiliation. the biggest political battles are in fact fought over the biggest states, in the forms of advertisements and propaganda. Although the propaganda is truely just that: propaganda, there is some truth in them, and the voters in bigger states are more well versed in the political and practical advantages of one canidate over the other. Article 3, while defending the Electoral College, in fact condems itself, by saying that voters in so called ""swing states,"" where there is no true dominant party, are likely to be given the most information on the canidates as they battle over who will get that state's votes in the college. The same thing can be said for the bigger states, because neither politician can really afford to let the other gain the upper hand in that state. Therefore smaller states, or states that are basicly marooned on one party are ignored or disregarded as worthless and unattainable in any case, so they widthold information from them, forcing them to vote blindly in favor of whichever party they choose, which votes may be discarded anyway. With an uncensored popular vote, the political canidates will be forced to advertise for all of the united states, instead of just the bigger or indevisive states. this will also remove all of the unfair advantages from the larger states, including more information as well as an unfairly weighted voting system.

","In the 2012's election, obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes. Obama won cause of the electoral college. Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality in a state creates a lanslide electoral-vote victory in that state.

In our brain we usually only think of our own opinion. Our viewpoint. But, there are two sides to every story. We often forget about our peers opinions when making a decision. Having an outsiders opinion can help you learn other peoples opinions and point of views on the situation and it can help you learn how your decision can effect others.

Giving students the opportunity to customize the projects to a more time conservative approach aids in both the learning experience because the work is still getting done accordingly, and there is still time reserved for a summer break that the students deserve and should be able to fully enjoy.

419,419,"The Electoral College in the other hand, allows votes from states to be made. It is an easier method to get the states to vote for the president, and it takes less time. ","Presidential elections provides the United States of America with an opprotunity of unification. The process of choosing the next leader of the United States always brings the people of the country together knowing that all of them play a role in the election. This is present in the popular vote, a vote consisting of the general population. However, the popular vote is not always accurate, as anyone of any background can vote as long as they hold proper citzenship. The electoral college on the other hand, is a process that serves as a compromise between Congress and the rest of America. "

This way the delegation people can pick who's good for president. ,"I read an article stating that if a tie were to happen the election would be thrown to the house of representatives, where state delegations vote on the president.

421,421,"Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over sixty percent would perfer a direct vote than have the elctoral college vote also. The vote could be very close even if one candidate wins by much in the popular vote due to the presidency vote. If there was a tie in the electoral vote the election would be thrown to the House of Represenstatives. Instead of all that work if there was only a popular vote it would be quick and simple. ","A presidential candidate that wins by a large majority in a state will win the electoral votes of that state, however, if another candidate wins a very close election, he/she will also win a state. For example, in the 2000 presidential election between Al Gore and President Bush, Al Gore won the popular vote of the people but lost the election for president because of the electoral college, the very fact that we know what the popular vote was is proof of neccesity of change. Not only this, but sixty percent of voters want to vote directly. This makes it possible for a candidate to have more individual votes but less electoral votes, making the system somewhat corrupt. "

They also may becuase they might have a problem going on and don't know what to do and ask for help and advice. They also may be in a serious siuwation and need advice badly to make their next more. ,"Why is it more beneficial to seek multiple opinions when making a decision? When people ask for advice, they are usually conflicted about something, or don't know what to do. The reason that one person asks for advice could be because they don't know what shoes to wear, or it could be because they need advice about something bigger, like what house to buy. Either way, they are still seeking other people's opinions. When you are asking a person for advice, you want a definite answer. You could ask one person for advice about what shoes to wear, and they could say black, and then you could ask someone else for advice about the same thing, and they could say a different answer. "
423,423,I feel like if you take an online class you have a greater chance of pasting to the next grade than me. I have an good and bad response to online classes. In an online class you have no consequences like student's in school have. Online classes is unique because you do what you want when you want. ,"In conclusion, online course do not benefit students because gaining an in-person experience with teachers can help a student learn better from their mistakes on certain types of questions. They also do not benefit students by having more of a likely chance to cheat during exams online. Because of this, this does not prepare students for further growth of knowledge if they want to continue to do school after high school. The final reason students do not benefit from online courses is that students need friends in person because that is what makes them have a good childhood and become a better person based of off their opinions. To conclude, online courses are not a way to help students at all during this day and age. It has too many flaws that can not be fixed unfortunately. A lot of things are growing in this society, but this should not grow any further. "

432,432,"For projects with the intentions to keep students learning while on summer break the first issue would be students making projects on subjects that have no relevance to school, this would be very inefficient in the efforts made by school boards to keep students learning. ","Summer projects are something to make sure students keep learning over their break. It's clear to see that teacher-designed projects are much more efficient. Without the guidance of teachers, students could make simplistic projects that offer no benefit for the teacher or student. The teacher's knowledge about the project could make it helpful for their students to keep learning different ways about the material. It is also common for students to forget or lose interest when they are given too much responsibility for an assignment. Student-designed projects can leave room for a large quantity of errors and mistakes that could ultimately defeat the purpose of a project. Therefore, teacher- designed projects are better in the sense that they can keep the student learning as if they are still in school but give them time to enjoy the benefits that come with summer break.           "

Another example that the author proves is that Garvin said it reminded him of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face and perhaps alien markings were hidden by haze. Also NASA can be hidding information about the Face.

The author of this article talks of how it will improve ad placements by whether you smile or frown, however I know for a fact social medias, especially Facebook, are already basing information on preferable ads by just what material you look at. Why is it necessary for a program to constantly scan our face just to see if we like something or not? This gives the computer so much power of constantly knowing what your exact emotions are on everything. It is just so unnecessary that it causes one to question why in the world would we risk giving computers that kind of power. Also, is it appropiate to constantly scan childrens' faces as they are trying to learn? Would there be a security system in place or parental agreement necessary that would allow the permission of constant invasion of privacy in the name of education? There are many ethical questions and unknown future outlooks that one would not want to subject children to that sort of test of safety and security. "

And, had NASA really claimed that the Face was an object built by otherworldly life, surely someone would let the cat out of the bag. Not to mention that, if the vast majority of NASA believed it was an alien monument, do you really think that they would wait eighteen years to investigate the subject again? On top of all of this, it's simply illogical that aliens would create such a thing. As far as we all know, the supposed ""aliens"" on Mars have never come in contact with a human, much less seen one. That only leaves possible explanation; aliens created a monument that of which coincedentally resembles a human head. An absolute coincedence. "

We could even send out e-mails to each student's parents telling them of this idea.  If the parents find out about this, I believe they will certainly force their kids to take part in a small amount of community service.  All I am asking from you, is to just enforce this one little rule into our school.  It could change lives.

It also stops you from making a bias, or prejudice, decision. It shows you what the majority of people think, and lets you hear from everyone.

This is not how a republic is supposed to run. People are supposed to be granted the opportunity to elect the president of their choice, not of somebody elses. The most popular vote would take into consideration of every citizen's opinion with a direct percentage of votes to elect a certain candidate. In the article, ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President,"" Richard A. Posner states, ""The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president."" This may be true but if the most popular vote system was put into place, there would be an even more exact number of how many people voted for each candidate. The Electoral College does not voice the opinions of all citizens because in reality, a person is not directly voting for their desired candidate. They are voting for other representatives that will hopefully, in turn, elect the candidate they want. Obviously, the Electoral College is definitely a system that should be abolished in the United States of America. "

Things such as houses or buildings, for example. Now, if some one would like to argue that the aliens lived in caves or other natural formations of the sort, how would those people like to argue the fact that there are no visible creatures in any photos? Do they expect people to believe that every living thing on Mars decided to hide from a satelite they would not even be able to see from the surface? "

It's valuable because it can tell how Mona Lisa demontrates is really intended to bring a smile. ,"Emotion is in the brain, not the heart. The way the FACS understands emoion is simple. It maps out a 3-D model of the face, looks at the shape and positoin of all the muscles, then it associates the different facial movements with differet emotion. For example, your orbicularis oris (muscles around your mouth) tighten your lips to show when you are angry. It even works when a person it trying to mask emotions. During a fake smile, the zygomatic major stretches the mouth sidways, while in a real smile the zygomatic major lifts the corners of the mouth. These examples can show how science IS able to understand emotoin, probaly better than most humans. Arguments that use that falshood, that science is unable to understand emotion, is completly false.

462,462,Having good guidelines and being told what the expectations are will give students a better chance at success. ,"Having set rules and requirements created by teachers, ensures that students will complete the tasks to a high level. During the summer, students would rather not have educational work to focus on, but projects created by the teacher enforces these students to do so. If these projects were student-designed, it could potentially allow them to finesse the system, and create a project that does not require much thinking and work. Student-designed projects also leaves room for error. Projects constructed by students leaves the door open for many mistakes, which will ultimately hurt the student in the end. This prevents students from working efficiently and fully understanding the topic they are working on. The goal of teacher-designed projects is to not control the students, but to make sure that the students are obtaining knowledge, understand the assignment, and are producing high quality work. Students may be confused or have numerous of questions with student-designed projects since there are no specific guidelines and rules, so having teacher-designed projects are ideal because they explicitly state what they are looking for.

Taking online courses can have a negative and tragic effect on a student's body leading to eye problems, the eye being a very important body part. This may eventually let the student become unproductive and lazy. Also many students prefer having a face to face teaching session to make learning more efficient and better to understand overall. Students across the world should be able to learn the importance of physically being in school where there's plenty of teachers and resources around. Being in school is very important and can greatly benefit students. Technological advancements in the modern world is also very important and have been beneficial in helping with education and making education better. But students should not let the technology of today make them lazy and they should be willing to work hard and diligently.                      "

As the author states in the article, ""most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"" something which computers are unable to detect (para. 6). Not only this, but the author gives an analogy that states ""if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a smilar ad might follow"" and explains that in a classroom, similar techniques can be applied to benefit the student (para. 6). Using this program will allow technology to advance and in turn will benefit the student. "

But afterwards after that happening, it saids how some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile the defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an acient civilization on Mars. Also, although few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact photographing Cydonia became a prioprity for NASA when Global Surveyor arrived at the Red Planet in September. 1997, eighteen long years ago after the Viking missions ended. ","So in conclusion it is not a alien made face it simply in a mesa or a landmark on Mars. The proof is in the article when you see the 3 picutes that were taken to prove it wasn't a alien made artifact. No matter how cool it would be if it was not to mention that it could make NASA famous or rich it just doesn't have the proof you need to be a alien artifact. If you look more into the passage it even says it was not a alien made artiffact. Yes this face was very famous it even says ""The ""Face"" on Mars has since been a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, apperered in books, magazines, and even radio shows."" (5). See how famous that face was 25 years ago is amazing but it still doesn't mean it was a alien made artiffact. So in final say it is not a alien made face and nor will there be enough proof its just a landmark on Mars that was very popular to people everywhere!           "

People have also studied the solar system to help explore and give information about the planets around us. One planet that scientists have studied for a good amount of time is Venus since it shows that at one time, the planet might have inhabited living organisms. However, Venus is a very dangerous planet since many attempts of landing spacecraft has failed on Venus and the clouds of the planet are made of sulfuric acid. Venus is not worth the pursuit of knowledge since the planet has a very dangerous enviorment for humans and that not a single spacecraft has landed safely on the planet and returned. "
472,472,By students getting the chance to try new things they could step out of their comfort zone and get the chance to explore new talents.

This can also make students get more creative with the project when it comes to design or topic that others may find interesting. If students had more freedom with their project allowing them to be creative and showing the teachers what they can do could benifit them because the teacher can give the student more opportunities when doing future projects. Also if the school some very creative project than the student can be recommended to events or major schools in the future. Also when giving students more freedom it can allow them to express themselves or maybe make a point when doing a project on their own. Also when doing a teacher-designed project then students will fell more restrained and more like they are forced to a project. If students had to do their own designed project than they would probably do it more willingly. "

The author of this article talks of how it will improve ad placements by whether you smile or frown, however I know for a fact social medias, especially Facebook, are already basing information on preferable ads by just what material you look at. Why is it necessary for a program to constantly scan our face just to see if we like something or not? This gives the computer so much power of constantly knowing what your exact emotions are on everything. It is just so unnecessary that it causes one to question why in the world would we risk giving computers that kind of power. Also, is it appropiate to constantly scan childrens' faces as they are trying to learn? Would there be a security system in place or parental agreement necessary that would allow the permission of constant invasion of privacy in the name of education? There are many ethical questions and unknown future outlooks that one would not want to subject children to that sort of test of safety and security. "

Often these canidates do the right thing and vote based on votes gifen to him by the public ","This means that our votes don't really count for much. It also means that even though we voted for someone the slate could have voted for someone completely different. Also we the people have no idea who the electors are. Who even picks them? The electors that are chosen depends on the state, sometimes it's the state conventions, sometimes the states party's central committee, and sometimes it can be the presidential canidate himself. Some voters didnt even see campaigne ads, so how did they chose their presidential caidate? They didn't, the Electoral College did. "

492,492,"Selecting the Electors,the meeting for the president and vice president,and the counting of electoral votes by congress is a better idea than 60 percent of voters  prefering a direct election to kind we have now. I understand that under the  Electoral College system,voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors,who turn elect the president. If you lived in texas for instance and wanted to vote for john kerry you'd vote for a slate of 34 democratic electors pledged to kerry,On the off-chance that those electors won the statewide election they would go to congress and kerry would get 34 lectoral votes. Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidates,s political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their reponsibilities are. At the most basic level the  Electoral College is unfair to voters because of the winner take all system in each state,canidatdes dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning.  Election by popular vote for the president of the  United States  Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral votes compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and romney becausw almost all states award electoral votes on a winner take all basis even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral vote victory in that state. A tie in a nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes 538 is an even number,but it is highly unlikely but each party selcts a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely. It happened in 2000, when Gore had more popular votes than bush yet fewer electoral votes,but that was the first time since 1888 thats happened. there are five reasons for reraining the electoral college despite its lackof democratic pedigree all practical reasons not liberal or conservative reasons. A disput ove routcome of an electoral college vote is possible it happened in 2000 but it's less likley than a dispute over the popular vote. ","""Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" This shows that more than half the voters, would rather just vote the president instead of having the Electoral College do it for them "
493,493,"Now it is possible for somebody to secretly change the names that way but it is a higher stake, or risk to take not having the Electoral College. ","Electoral College should be abolished because the electors may help ruin the president election and large states are not vistied or spoken to from the president other than small states. Electoral college may seem an unfair disadvantage for most voters many of their campaign that they want to win can be rather at a disadvantage or advantage depending on their electors,  many electors may betray their campaign because they're not pubilicly held in office. Lastly the disadvantage is that many voters want to see what and how they are going to change or improve their well being, but most electors and campaigns do not visit the states that want view and know the candidates better. The electoral College should be abolished for the matter of the voter and the United States of America. In my opinion we should be allowed to vote on our own, for example instead of voting for an elector we should just vote on the type of campagin whose better and meet our daily bases needs.  "

495,495,Sometimes the votes get overulled by the popular vote. The electors really only focus on the swing states.

There are no recounts in Electoral College, whoever they like the most becomes President, and that ins't fair to the people. Bigger states tend to have more members in the electoral college.
