Statistical proof show where it may help and real life examples of some of the effects of reducing, or getting rid of altogether, cars in one's daily life. While ""recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by"" (Source 4), is that really enough or for the right reason? There are plenty of reasons to stop, or limit, the amount of cars being driven on the roads for every kind of person, from the hippie to the businessman, from the mom to the college student. "
1	With so many things in this world that few people agree on, this is a nice change to see in regards the removal of so many cars. Why would they all agree, one might ask. Well, there are plenty of reasons.  
2	"It is no secret that morning traffic jams and 5'o'clock traffic is often enough to send any driver into a fit of unadulterated rage and what better way is there to prevent that than to simply not drive at all? Mother and media trainer, Heidrum Walter attested to this after moving into a mostly car-less community, claiming ""when [she] had a car [she] was always tense. [She's] much happier [that] way"" (Source 1). If that were not enough, businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza who participated in the Day Without Cars in Bogota, Colombia, after just a day was able to say ""it's a good oppurtunity to take away stress"" (Source 3). Just one day was enough to de-stress this man and if that does not speak wonders, one has to wonder what does. The event ""[left] the streets of [Bogota] eerily devoid of traffic jams"" (Source 3), which goes to show how stressful it was everyday, with traffic jams a common occurance. No one enjoys them, so why continue to suffer through them? "
3	the environment suffers greatly from the many car emissions let out on the roads. 
4	"""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe ... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"" (Source 1). This alone should be enough to horrify anyone out of such copious amounts of car usage. If that were not enough, ""transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions"" (Source 4). It is clear that cars are only doing more harm to this earth all humans live on and happen to only have one of, so there is no need to continue on knowing this without changing something about that. Even car-pooling could significantly reduce emissions as there would be less cars out there, which is possible through ""more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work"" (Source 4).  "
5	, adding the last two reasons together makes for another very important factor in all of this: everyone's general health. Both stress and high concentrations of smog can do a toll on one's body and the reduction of cars, once again, helps to reduce this terrible down-sides to the easy transportation option 
6	It is also worth noting that cities that have embraced a no car lifestyle such as Vauban or Bogota have generally improved as a community and have given back anything the newly car-less citizens may have been missing out on through saving them time and money. 
7	"In Vauban, ""stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway"" (Source 1). This is not only much more cost-efficient, but also convienent. This is saving both time and money, just like in Bogota where ""parks and sports centers [] have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up"" (Source 3). Not only does this help individual citizens and business owners, it helps the overall economy of the city as well.  "
8	Individual car use isn't bad. Millions of individuals using cars, however, is very bad. Note the emphasis. Even just making a concious effort to car pool, bike to work or school, use public transportation, or use some sort of alternative transportation could be enough to clear up the air of some of it's emissions, keep oneself and others happier and less stressed, save time and money, and improve their city all in one little decision. It's just a matter of going ahead and doing it, so what is stopping anyone from going out and making that change now? Be the change you want to see and limit your car usage now.  
9	easy plagiarism 
10	teachers' knowledge on how to deisgn and grade a project. 
11	"When i was in the 6th grade, for fun, our teacher assigned the class to design a volcano that had to shoot up as far as possible into the air, made with paper mache, glue, and other accessible materials. There wasn't much instruction on how to do the volcano, as long as we were the ones building it, and the idea/design was original. Most kids' volcanoes looked pretty amateur, with varying degrees of success. However, the kid whose volcano shot up the highest, was disqualified for copying his design and materials exactly from a project someone had shared on the internet.  If a student can plagiarize someone's work from a project loosely designed by a teacher, then even more students can plagiarize a project that ""they themselves"" designed. "
12	Often times throughout middle school, my teachers would give the students each other's assignments to grade themselves. And afterwards, we would see in the grade book that the grade changed because the students weren't grading the assignments the way they should have been. The student grading was meant to engage the classroom, but it turned into a showcase of how students dont really know how to grade the way teachers do. If students are unaware of how a project is supposed to be graded, they can not successfully design a project that tests whether or not they understand the material. 
13	"Some people may say, ""but allowing students to design their own projects will allow them to focus more on their work during the summer."" "
14	Whenever I'm given a summer assignment, I know for a fact it I won't even look at the assignment until maybe about a few days before the first day of school. Which would lead to me rushing a lazily put together assignment and a not so good grade. Giving students the opportunity to design their own assignments will lead to students rushing their projects, and justifying it by claiming that the level of quality meets the standards of their assignment. 
15	Have you ever been bored in a class room such as your highschool english classes? Well do to a brand new algorithum made by Dr. Paull Eckman, creator of the FACS(Facial Action Coding System), you can finaly be exited about learning about greek and latin roots. This program can detect how you are felling and in what precentages 
16	In the more populated citys, people are using more bikes and less cars. Its easier to get around a city where there are thousands of people on the streets alone. 
17	This is a place for clean air and no pollution from the car fumes. As of right now, this experiment seems to be running quite nicely. 
18	Have you ever ever been required to do a summer project that your not intreasted in? Certain schools in America require students to complete summer projects to ensure they are still learning over break. Students are often assined teacher designed projects. While most students complete these over summer projects many students don't due to lack of intrest in the assined topic. 
19	To improve student input schools should move towards student designed projects so students will be more intrested and and involved in the project. 
20	While a summer project is not something most students would like to do over there break, teachers could allow there students to choose a topic or unit to base there project on. 
21	Students can use this to there advantage and choose a topic they were intreasted. Students could learn and still enjoy working on the project. Students also have an easier time working on topics that they have knowledge on allowing them to complete there work easily. Students can take advantage of being able to design there own project and choose a topic or unit that they struggled on through out the year. Working on these weak points can strengthen your skills for next school year. Students can go back and look at past notes and worksheets helping improve there skills in that topic. 
22	Students being able to design there projects could allow the student to create something they enjoy doing over the summer with friends and family, rather then students thinking of it as another teacher assined project that is boring 
23	 Overall schools that require summer break projects should move towards student designed projects over teacher designed ones. When students have the ability to choose from certain topics and units they can decide what is best for them. Using the project to work on material that they were intrested in through out the year and want to further research and learn about or use the oppurtunity to study material that the student had trouble with over the school year so that they can be caught up for next year. Furthermore students can create projects that will help them with future cirriculum for next year. In conclusion schools should use student designed projects because it allows the student to choose how they want to utilize the time for either further studying a topic, going back and reviewing areas they had trouble in or learning future topics for next school year. 
24	Almost every student knows the dread of going back to school. The easy and laid back summer fads out and suddenly it's back to the old grind. The sleeping in till noon goes back to waking up at six, bathing suits get put back in the closet, and the sun tans fade. Yet, almost every student can relate to the one thing that always keeps them tied to school during the summer, the dreaded summer assignment. It could be a book report or a math packet, either way it burns in the back of their minds while they cannonball into pools. It seeps into thoughts while they try to fall asleep. 
25	If teachers gave students the opportunity to discover their own work, and maybe even a passion, students work would be of a higher quality and it might actually have them excited to go back to school. 
26	When students have the ability to decide what they will study in a project, they are more excited and more willing to get the work done. 
27	Now, this assignment can not be a free for all, that would not be completely fair. There may be some students who go above and beyond while some may do the bare minimum and call it done. 
28	To avoid this scenario teachers could implement some sort of rubric or guidelines for what the student chosen project would have to include and how they will go about grading it. This way the playing field is level and everyone has the opportunity to succeed. 
29	With a student chosen project, students may feel more inclined to do their work because working on something that interests them won't feel like such a chore. 
30	The end of summer is not fun for anyone involved, students and teachers alike. Why would we want to dampen the vacation with unexciting work looming over students heads the whole time. Students should feel excited to go back to school and be they should have something to look foward to sharing with their classes. It is common knowledge that doing work that is uninteresting to you lowers your performance and makes the work that much more of a chore. With student selected summer assignments we can prevent that and create a new wave of excitement about returning to school.  
31	Many students have a lot of things to do at home and they're already busy with other things. Students have a lot of homework to do from different teachers. For an example students are given a lot of homework and have chores to do at home like cleaning clothes, taking care of their pets, cleaning the house or taking care of their siblings. Some students are already tired from school and might not want to participate in any other activity because they have to wake up early for school and have to do school work really early even though science say that the human brain starts working correctly when it's ten in the morning so that means the human brain of a middle school might not work so well at six or seven in the gosh darn morning. 
32	How much value would come out of going to Venus? Scientists have tried many times to study Venus. Unfortunatley, they've always come out as failures. People could argue that the effort of studying Venus is useless and ineffective. However, scientists have little to no knowledge of how the planets in our solar system were made. Scientists could have more knowledge of Venus if they found a way to study the planet. 
33	Students may also use this feature in art classes to really capture what the artist was depicting in the work. For instance, this new software was able to create percentages of Mona Lisa's emotions. The latest innovation in computer software may be very useful for art classes, knowing how a person may be feeling in a painting may help students to depict the artists work, a bit better. As humans, we can tell how someone may be feeling by the look on their face, or the look in their eyes. Most of us would have trouble trying to describe what facial expressions convey being happy, besides a smile. The computer can make exact percentages on each emotion you may be feeling. 
34	You may like soccer, art, or even debate. The possibilities are endless to any activity that you could join at your school. Extracurricular activities are important to every school. Though every school has different activities, each and every one of them play a key role. Students may wonder why their principal would make them have to stay after a long day of learning. Students may think that extracurricular activities aren't interesting, but they may not realize how many options their school has to offer. Our principal should start putting up sheets that inform you on what activities we have and a brief explanation about them. 
35	Every student matters and can make a difference. A good way to be involved at school is to join an extracurricular activity. For example, if someone joined the SCA then they would be involved by organizing school dances and events. Giving ideas to the student council is another way to be a part of your school. Say you thought that the dress code needed to be adjusted, you could join a club and talk about it. These clubs can be used to spread awareness for bullying. Someone could of been bullied and they want to feel part of something so they join a club for bullying awareness. Students should encourage others to be part of something at their school. There are numerous ways to be involved at your school, all you need to do is put yourself out there.  
36	If you are generally a shy person then a club or sports team will help you meet new people. For instance, if you get on a sports team you and your team will become one big family. You all will work together during games which will create a bond. Another example is if you join an art club you will have something to talk about because you both will like art. Sometimes it can be hard to open up to people and make friends but trust me doing an activity will help that tremendously. When I first joined JV soccer I was really intimidated by all the big kids, but then I talked to them and they seemed really nice and talked to me. This goes to show that extracurricular activities can help you make friends that you would of never made if you didn't join that club. 
37	Even if you have no experience with an of the choices, but it sounds interesting to you then you should go for it. Trying out new things is good and you never know how good you'll be at it. If you try photography for the first time you could like it so much that you do it again next year. Also, you could join the tennis team and realize that you're really good at it and end up becoming a famous tennis player. However, not everyone is going to like the choices that they have. Well, our school could have an option that students get to create a club that they would like. This solves the problem because other students could like the same thing as their peers so they would want to join that club. Someone could want to create a club for ROTC and another student may want to be in the military so they join that club. Instead of joining a random club because you have to, try to actually find one that you enjoy. There are many choices for students because the principal want everyone to be able to do an activity that they like. 
38	I agree with Dr. Hung that the software would be useful to help decipher mixed emoitions. 
39	"""We have to join a club?"" Generic_Name said shocked, ""Like, we have to?"". Generic_Name looked confused and slightly angry. ""Yes Generic_Name, you do have to join a club, it's a requirement for the new year."" said Principal Generic_Name. Generic_Name looked down than looked back up at his principal, ""Great."" Generic_Name said sarcastically. Generic_Name spent that school day looking around and asking about the different clubs the school offers. While Generic_Name was looking, one club caught his eye. The gaming club. When Generic_Name was out of school he always played video games, it was his favorite pass time! Since the gaming club was the only club that sounded remotely appealing to Generic_Name, he signed up. His first day in the club, he was skeptical, but he quickly realized the club was far better than he expected. 2 weeks passed since Generic_Name joined and he already made plenty of new friends and learned about many new games that he grew to love. "
40	having students join and participate in an extracurricular activity can help them meet new people and make new friends. 
41	"Joining an extracurricular activity such as a club or a sports team can be very beneficial to students. Having students join clubs can help shy students talk to new people and make more friends. Even someone who is frequently talkative and already has a lot of friends can meet and talk to new people who share the same interests as them in the club. Having friends who share your interests is something that every student wants, and joining an extracurricular activity can help students achieve that. It was only Generic_Name's first day in the club when he met two people who would later become his best friends. ""Hello,"" said a voice Generic_Name has never heard, ""My name is Generic_Name."". Generic_Name looked at Generic_Name and shook his hand, ""Hey Generic_Name, i'm Generic_Name. Nice too meet you"". The person standing behind Generic_Name introduced himself next. ""Sup Generic_Name. My name's Generic_Name, I'm Generic_Name's Friend."" he said. ""Nice too meet you as well Generic_Name."" Generic_Name replied. Generic_Name, Generic_Name and Generic_Name quickly became good friends because of their similar interests. "
42	requiring students to join an extracurricular activity can introduce students to something they've overlooked in the past, or something completely new. 
43	"Students have their interests, they either like something, or they don't. Something might not come off as interesting to them at first glance. They might only start to realize something is interesting to them when they take another look. If schools do an event that shows off each different club, students will get that ""second glance"" that they need. For example, my older brother wanted to join a club in high school. He looked through the website and found that nothing sounded interesting to him. He decided to look again, this time actually reading the descriptions of each club. He eventually found the art club. He read the description, thought it sounded interesting and signed up. "
44	"ubs and sports are very social activities. If they're in a club, students are basically required to socialize with others. This for the most part is a very positive benefit, allowing students to talk to others who share similar interests with them. Students may even spend time outside the clubs with the people they've met. For example, my cousin Generic_Name's mom, forced Generic_Name to join a club. She said Generic_Name wasn't socializing enough and spent to much time time on his computer. Generic_Name asked around to find a club that was preferably easy. He eventually found the computer club which aligned with his interests, and his want to spite my aunt by ""playing on computers"" in his club. Despite that my aunt got her wish and Generic_Name became more social outside of school with his new club.  Generic_Name had spent his entire 10th grade year in the gaming club. Now that summer was approaching for the first time in his life he felt sad about leaving during the summer. Generic_Name never thought by joining a club his perception about school would change this drastically. The next day Generic_Name and his club talked about meeting up over the summer, everyone was ecstatic about the idea. Generic_Name, Generic_Name, and Generic_Name all have met up before outside of the club before, but the entire club has never got together like this. School ended just as fast as it started and the day quickly approached when the club would get back together again. "
45	schools should make it so all students have to participate in an extracurricular activity such as a club or a sport because it helps students make new friends and build relationships, it can introduce students to something they've overlooked in the past, and it can increase social activity among students. 
46	"According to the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" there is a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) that enables computers to identify human emotions. This technology is relatively brand new. It creates a 3-D computer model of all fourty-four major muscles in the face that move like human muscles as well. Then, psychologists have classified six basic emotions that are associated with different movements in the facial mucles. This new technology could result in many benefits in our community as well as all around the world "
47	The use of the Facial Action Coding System to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable 
48	it would allow teachers to know when students become confused 
49	are being dishonest 
50	or are depressed and possibly having problems at home. 
51	In the classroom, it is common for students to tend to get confused while being taught a lesson. It is also common for students to get bored and become uninterested in the lesson at hand. With the Facial Action Coding System, teachers can make sure that their students are acquiring the best education possible and absorbing all of the material. 
52	"Teachers can adapt their teaching style according to how students respond to the lesson being taught. This way, both the students and teachers can be on the same page, making education easier for students and teachers. The article states,""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor,'"" (D'Alto). In this quote, Dr. Huang is telling the reader how this new technology could possibly develop into something much bigger where it can modify the lesson for students who become bored or confused, making it an easier and better experience for the student. "
53	The technology could be able to detect if a student is being dishonest, which could prove very handy when dealing with situations with delinquents and trouble-makers. 
54	Just before the bell rings to dismiss students for year, teachers are struggling to keep the attention of students when explaining their summer assignments for the break. The students know that the summer assignments are important, but their attention is on the bell that declares summer vacation. Summer assignments are designed to ensure that students continue their intellectual journey over breaks. Both teacher-designed projects and student-designed projects accomplish this goal, however, one of the biggest challenges is deciding whether teacher-designed projects or student-designed project would do a better job at accomplishing this goal 
55	 Summer projects should be teacher-designed because teachers have a better understanding of the material, 
56	the project will be less stressful for students 
57	teacher-designed projects will prevent misjudgment of students by teachers.  
58	Teachers should design summer projects because they have a better understanding of the material they are trying to teach. 
59	They also tend to have a clear understanding of what they expect from students for the projects they assign. By assigning teacher-designed summer projects, the teacher can guide the students to learn what the teachers want them to discover. They also provide a more specific rubric so the students know exactly what is expected of them. For example, AP Biology has a lot of material that needs to be covered in just one year. To solve this issue, they assign a teacher-designed summer assignment that consists of an introduction to each unit learned throughout the year. This way, students are prepared when going in depth with all of the concepts in class because they already have a grasp of the topic learned during break. By assigning teacher designed projects, teachers can guide the students to ensure that what they are learning and exploring can help them perform better in class. 
60	Another reason teachers should design the summer project, is that the project will be less stressful to students overall. 
61	Although teachers are expected to be unbiased, they will always have personal beliefs that may clash with a student's beliefs. During student-designed projects over the summer, students do not know the personal beliefs and preferences of their teacher because many students have not spent much time with their future teacher. Student-designed projects are often stressful in this situation because students do not always know the teacher's expectations. Students do not want to receive a lower grade on their project because of the biases of the teacher. Students also feel anxious because they never know if their project is unique enough to get a good grade and if the teacher will find it as interesting as the student. For example, many science classes require students to conduct experiments in a field they find interesting. Not only is this assignment very vague, but it is also unfair. There are many different ways a student could take this project and some projects require more time and effort than others. For example, testing to see the effects of personal care products that get into waterways on marine life requires a lot more time, effort, and materials compared to testing which brand of paint needs the least amount to coats to adequately cover the walls. Both of the projects meet the criteria, but one project may be considered better than the other by a teacher. This gives many students anxiety because they never know if their project is good enough. Student-designed projects are too stressful and often end up diminishing the quality of the student's summer break by giving them anxiety.  
62	Some teachers may argue that student-designed summer projects are an outlet for students to show their creativity. They believe that students can showcase their intellectual level by completing student-designed projects and the teachers can get a better understanding of their students' beliefs and preferences through student-designed projects 
63	However, student-designed projects are not always the best reflection of the students and their work ethic. 
64	However, with teacher-designed projects, students can work with their future teacher to plan ahead to complete the assignment or complete a different assignment entirely depending on their situation. Students would not be forced to settle for something that is not a true reflection of their work ethic because of their circumstances. 
65	Teacher-designed projects are the best way for schools to ensure that students continue learning material for classes during break without causing anxiety in students or misjudgment of students by teachers. Summer projects are meant to help students but student-designed projects can sometimes harm students instead. Every student should be allowed to spend their summer without stressing about how they will be perceived by their fellow classmates and teachers the next year. Summer projects should encourage students to continue to learning while also spending quality time with their family and friends during their break. 
66	Growing up in a constantly changing environment, students have had to learn to adapt to the world around them. In school, students are taught to be open and ready to learn, while still facing the ups and downs in the journey of childhood to adulthood. Students make close bonds with their friends and even a few choice teachers. Students choose to whom they share their emotions with and at what time they wish to do so 
67	Emplimenting a computer system in schools that is capable of reading a students emotions is inappropriate, lazy, and dangerous. 
68	In school, students are faced with one major task: to learn. Teachers are faced with the task of teaching. A teacher's job is to engage students and the students job is to stay engaged with the teacher. 
69	Emplementing facial reading teachnology is innappropriate and dangerous to the privacy of students, and it threatens the basic principles school systems were founded upon. 
70	"Furthermore, this technology could be used in the wrong situations. The article stated that a smart school computer could tell when students are getting bored or confused and change the lesson, ""' A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. Then is could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.'"" This example puts teachers in an awkward position. Letting a smart, facial reading technology teach students would mean the teachers aren't teaching "
71	Giving power to technology is complacent, instead of working with people to improve learning habits or teaching methods, adults would be taking the easy way out. 
72	Their job is to connect and work with students. When introducing a computer system, students may realize they are just another task to be completed in the work place. Every year, students are analyzed to see where they place on the national benchmark for their education, they take standardized tests to see how much they know, they do hearing tests and eye tests, but a computer has yet to analyze them to see how happy they might be. If computers are introduced to read emotions, students may feel like they are just a number or rank of emotions. If students go to their counselors, they want to be talked to and connected with. Bringing in a computer can divide the connection from child to adult. The child may feel alienated and refuse to converse with the adult. This computer may seem like a helpful tool, but it destroys the importance of human connection. 
73	The age of computers is inescapable, but it doesn't have to be. Instead of computer analyzed emotional connection, people should put their phones down and ask each other how they are. Not every person wants their emotions analyzed, especially in schools. Students bonds with teachers are simply student to teacher; a child must trust an adult before they talk about their feelings. Computer facial technology might be helpful, but not in schools. This technology falls flat in the category of connection. Don't take the easy way out, instead of analyzing emotions with a computer, ask someone how they are. If a student looks upset, sit down and talk with them. Show someone they are valuable and deserve one on one human interaction 
74	Students often moan and groan about summer projects that their teachers assign them to do over summer break to assure they continue learning over the period they are not in school. The projects most of the time, have a set rule book to follow that was issued by the teacher and it makes the project boring and not enjoyable for the students to do, basically being a burden the students have to over come during their relaxing summer break. 
75	Having the project be more student-designed, students would not have to struggle with limitations and can be more creative and use their own ideas for a better outcome of the project. 
76	Teachers often put a strict instructional guide or manual on what to do and what not to do, during the assignment and limits what students can do and blocks any originality. However, having a student-designed project will unleash a wave of ideas and flow of creativity between each student that would not normally be received from a common project. The whole outcome of the entire project will be changed drastically because of the freedom students will have on their own projects and in which, in the end, will satisfy them. During research projects, teachers also frequently limit the student on what they can look up and use. If the project was student-designed, students can freely look up and use what interest them and learn about something that will make them more engaged into the project. They can not be held by idea blocking rules that will make the project disengaging, they can have creativity run free throughout the entire assignment and it will show. Overall, a student-designed project will make a more standout project due to the original ideas students will leave throughout the project. 
77	The sound of a project over the summer break already sounds boring and a headache of a time for any person in school to do but students will always be more engaged in a project that will allow their own unique spin on it and uses a piece of mind from them. 
78	"The thought of a project is always a dreadful one that all, will have a hard time to get them self to do it but a student-designed project will make it at least, a more enjoyable experience. Students can utilize their brain and knowledge to make it a project to remember and have fun while thinking of an idea to blow teachers and fellow classmates away once they return from break. For example, a science fair allows students to show a unique idea with experiments, this causes fun competition and a enjoyable process on how the project is going to ""wow' the judges. Speaking of competition, if the project would also have an incentive to try to achieve the best project, students would even be more thrilled. The student-designed project will show a big amount of their own ability to the assignment and make them strive for the number one spot. This would heighten the accomplishment of the project and give them a sense of excitement for their own unique project to compete with classmates. In the end, rather than having a normal boring project, students who have a chance to design their own project, will have a lot more fun and excitement in the process of doing the project, in which, will still allow them to learn and not interrupt with their fun and relaxing summer break. "
79	Projects also have a based way of learning, a way teachers think it's best for our generation to learn, but they are not our generation, they do not know what is best for us, they just think it; by allowing students to freely design their project, they can learn in their own ideal way. 
80	When teachers assign projects that are related to the class, it is reasonable because it help us understand the subject more, but when they assign a regular project, especially one over summer break, it is often a misguided project on what they think students want to learn but does not really aid them. Giving the chance for a student to do something they want to learn about, will get them more engaged and give them their ideal way of learning. They would not have to worry about what teachers think they should learn but rather what they want to learn and will aid them in the future. Students who do a project about what they want to learn will make doing a project like that more enjoyable over a summer break rather than a set learning experience. They will gather more information to aid them in what they want to do, instead of being given something they think they should do, this will make the learning experience way beneficial for them and not waste their time in the long run. They can continue to learn educational information for them and gain more knowledge that matches their learning style and will satisfy what they have learned. Therefore, students would have a better learning experience if they could do projects their own way and had design freedom and not be held down by a set learning path.  
81	Projects being put out during summer break will always be a boring and overbearing thing to complete and in some cases even ruin summer break for them overall just to learn information that teachers assign. Having the project be student-designed, however, will change the entire assignment in all, giving more creativity, better pacing, more enjoyment, and a better learning experience for students all around, it will benefit them rather than a teacher-designed project. All projects, even ones put out over summer break, should be student-designed because the outcome will have more uniqueness with student's ideas, the project overall will be more fun, and students will learn in their own learning way.         
82	Summer projects are given to students so they can continue to learn and not fall behind in the coming school year. But would it help if the summer projects are created by teachers? Well yes, teachers have been teaching and making projects for a long time and they would know what they are doing. As a high school student I could prefer that my teacher makes the projects verse some student who not much of an expert on the topic.  
83	they have more experience, 
84	the project can be less confusing, 
85	the project can give the student an insight of what the class will be like. 
86	With so much experience and training they would know how to design a project that will allow the students to continue to learn through out the summer. For example, I am taking AP chemistry and there was a summer assignment. This assignment was created by the teacher and it was easy to comprehend and do. This made my experience with working on the project much more productive and less time consuming. 
87	Many of the projects that I have done were mostly teacher-designed and they were easy to understand and finish without too many hurdles. If there were to be any confusion it would be much easier to contact the teacher about a question than a student. When there are less mistakes in the project it would be more time effective and one would be able to finish the project faster.  
88	This would help students to be prepared for the coming year and they would also know what to expect. For instance, when I had received a summer project for AP statistics as I was doing the project I was able to understand more about what statistic is and how the class work would be like. However, if a student were to create the project it might not have given a picture of how the class would be like through out the year. 
89	schools should have summer projects that are designed by teachers. This way students would be more benefited due to the teachers knowledge on the topic. When the teachers do create the project there will be more clarity on what the student should do. The students will also be able to get a feel of the class in the coming year.  
90	It's 9pm, you haven't finished your homework. You would've finished your homework, if you had the choice to go straight home. However, the extra curricular you have to participate in, took too much time. That's the view of a student, if they would have to participate in a extracurricular activity. Students would have no time to play their Xbox, and have no time to finish that 8 paragraph essay, if they had to participate in a extracurricular activitiy 
91	Extracurricular activities, are for people who want to be in that activity, or feel interested in it. If student's aren't interested in that activity, then why should they be forced to do it? 
92	Phones and Driving, should it be a thing? Today over 5 billion people own a mobile device, and a little over 1 billion own some sort of vehicle.  These are two of the things people feel they need in life. But maybe the use of both at once is a bit too overwhelming. Driving while texting, or even making a phone call is excessive. It can be dangerous and hurt people in multiple ways 
93	For example, in February 2018, a 17 year old in Alabaster, Alabama killed a ten year old and her father in an accident because the teen was texting while driving. If the teen would have been paying attention to the road and not their phone the accident maybe could have been prevented. Not saying all accidents are caused by phone use, but a majority of them are. 
94	Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents involving texting and driving. 4,637 people died in the year 2018 because of the accidents. If that does not scare one into not using their phone while driving, then I don't know what will. This is one of the many reasons why I believe driving and the use of a phone should be banned!  
95	Another reason cell phone use while driving should be banned; if adults use their phone while operating a vehicle their children will possibly be strongly influenced by it. 
96	The children will start to think it is okay to do so. It is the year 2019 and all that this generation raves about is having a car and the newest IPhone if we are taught that it is okay to text and drive, someone can earnestly get hurt by these actions. Most accidents involve teen driving, we don't want to give them another reason to be absentminded while driving. 
97	The use of a mobile device while operating a vehicle should be prohibited. Now is the time to admit that driving while using a phone or any mobile devices is dangerous! You wouldn't want you or a loved one to end up critically injured, dead or disabled. Phone usage while driving is one of the many reasons accidents happen everyday. You can always wait until you are out of the car to make that call or answer that text !   
98	"There is a saying that goes as this; ""You can't make everyone happy."" One would typically use this saying if an action they make improves the situation for one person, but creates a worse situation for another. However, if Professor Thomas Huang's new 'Facial Action Coding System' proves to be what he says it can be, then Huang believes that there actually is a way to make everyone happy, even in the school setting. "
99	The implementation of technology able to read the emotional expressions of children in the classroom is valuable for both the teachers and the students. 
100	With this technology implemented, anytime a student starts to fall behind during the lesson, the computer could make slight adjustments to the teacher's plans to help redirect the student back on track. 
101	It is common knowledge that the more a student falls behind in a class, the harder it becomes to catch up, which in turn makes the student fall behind even more. It is a viscious cycle that all stems from a day of not paying attention that could be averted by this technology 
102	"This technology could also help both students and teachers in a long-term manner. In paragraph 7 of the article, it is revealed that this new technology could ""even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one"" (Paragraph 7). Say there is a classroom without an emotion-sensing computer. In the classroom there is a student who, behind the fake smile is dealing with something that they cannot tackle on their own. The teacher never notices, and the child goes on without help. Now imagine if there was a computer in that class "
103	Once it sensed the troubling expressions on the child's face, it could flag down the teacher and alert him or her to the students problem, resulting in the child getting the counceling he or she needs. 
104	"The amount of improvement a classroom could see if this technology was implemented correctly would be immeasurable. The system could prevent students from falling behind in class because they cannot relate to how the teacher is teaching, and the technology could see through fake expressions hiding more troubled thoughts. With this sort of system, it may actually be possible to ""make everyone happy.""    "
105	The national safety council estimates that 1.4million accidents occur every year due to people using their cell phones. 200,000 of those accidents alone are from texting and driving. How some people believe that texting and driving needs to be closely monitored because of the risk it involves. While other people think that it's alright to use your phone while driving as long as you keep glancing at the road as you are replying to your text 
106	Using your cell phone causes many distractions for your eyes, your mind, and your actions. 
107	It is easily possible for your eyes to slip off the road. Therefore, instead of your eyes locking in on your phone they should be locked on watching your speed, the road and the traffic. At the same time, while driving your mind can only process so much. In addition, your minds need to focus on one thing while driving and that is the road. Simultaneously, the usage of your phone while driving makes your unaware of the happenings that may occur on the road. Current health teens a recent magazine advises when you aren't on the road there's a great danger of missing something pay attention listen because it only takes a matter of time before you get in a wreck. Concentrating is important while driving and breaking the concentrating cause a risk for an accident if you're on the phone tell that person you are driving and that you will call them back later. 
108	Texting while driving not only endangers yourself but other people on the road as well 
109	"Texting while driving can limit your response to someone coming out of nowhere, whether if it's a child, an adult, or a group of teens. When having less time to respond to something in the road while texting and driving it may lead to many accidents and deaths. In addition, the usage of your phone while driving can cause a dangerous environment to the people around you on the road. Anyone can walk into the road at any time of the day and staying off your phone prevents anyone including yourself from getting hurt. In the same way, texting while driving causes many dangers risking not only young teens lives, but also adults lives in future accidents. Texting while driving ""causes own deaths and others, and need to pay attention to what's going on"". Meanwhile, while driving needs to be taken more serious you never know what to expect on the road. "
110	You can avoid texting while driving by texting before you drive. You can avoid texting while driving by texting before you drive. Henceforth, having safe driving habits all start with keeping both hands on the wheel, eyes on the road and mind focused on what's happening. Moreover, texting and driving may have a reachable desire but there is a solution by placing your phone out of reach. Above all, placing your phone out of reach helps you pay attention to driving instead of wondering what your messages says. Additionally, to prevent texting while driving simply ignore your phone by turning it off. Drivers safety websites notes to turn off your cell phone. Let your voicemail capture your voice and text messages. In summary turning your cell phone off will prevent any possible accidents making a safe environment. 
111	let students gain leadership skills, 
112	let them express their creativity. 
113	One of the many needed traits in life is leadership and is gained from setting a goal and reaching it. Leadership is an important trait because it shows your character and is necessary in a workplace. An example of a student-designed project is the Science Fair. The Science Fair allows students to choose a project of their own and complete it for a grade. The Science Fair is a perfect example of successful student led projects which also help gain leadership. Another example of a student-designed project is the MYP assignment. The MYP assignment is assigned to 10th graders, in Virginia, and are supposed to make a project from scratch. Their project is allowed to be anything they want and in any format which helps the students gain leadership skills when they finish. Important traits like leadership are gained from student-designed projects 
114	A student that loves cars will try more on a project they designed about cars then a teacher telling them to design a project about Anatomy. Also, if a student knows a lot about a specific topic then it would be easier to write about it compared to a topic they have almost no knowledge of. For example, if I know almost everything that has to do with Poker then I would rather write about that instead of computers which I know nothing about. During the summer, many students will be on vacation with their families. The summer is the one time students get a long relaxing break and are free from work. Summer projects assigned by teachers can be stressful and confusing at times which is why it should be a student-designed project. Students designing their own project would allow them to work on it at their own time and do it at a comfortable pace. Creativity is an important skill which students should be allowed to express. 
115	Teachers-designed projects would allow students to have a baseline of where to start from. One positive of teacher-designed projects would be they are professionally designed (by the Teacher). 
116	However, many teachers assign projects without thinking of the difficulty or issues that students could face. What if a student doesn't know anything about the topic? Well the teachers expects them to learn it themselves which is another reason giving students the ability to choose for them self is a good idea. A project designed by the teacher can take longer than they expect if students aren't fully educated about the topic. Consequently, this leads to students wasting more of their summer from trying to learn about then complete the teachers project. 
117	Remember in elementary school you used to get summer reading logs and checks on books you were 'required' to read during your break? Some students never had a problem with these types of assignments because they loved to read any chance they could get. Unfortunately, there were also the kids who would dread reading and give up after ten minutes or pretend they did the entire assignment. Though at this age, it really didn't matter whether or not you did the reading logs, it was just a little nudge your school would give you to do summer learning. However, when students reach higher levels of school, especially around high school, the requirement of summer projects is actually a requirement. Lots of students complain that it is unfair to do assignments over the one, long break they receive, but depending on the class subject it is for, sometimes these projects are essential. 
118	Summer is the only substantially long break that students receive off of homework, assignments and tests. Through the months of August until June, school does not cease. Almost every week, robotic-like students must wake up early Monday morning, suffer through eight hours of sitting and listen to a teacher go on about something like, why did the War of 1812 happen, how to dissect a frog, or solve for x. Five days are filled with this repeating schedule with two days to spare, and in my experience one of those days is set aside for weekend homework. No matter how much someone loves school and learning, eventually they need a break. Summer is the time to cut loose, hang out with friends, travel somewhere you've never been before and relax. Almost everyone has seen in a movie how students throw their books and papers up in the air as soon as that last day bell rings. Imagine receiving a final project the last day of school, requiring students to turn in on the first day of their next year of school. Now if that project was teacher-designed it might require a student to: 'write an eight page essay on the effects of propaganda use in your society' or 'create a tri-fold and 3-D display of a past, indigenous, tribe's village'. Just picturing these assignments make some people cringe. However, if summer projects were student-designed, people could create a piece of work that interests them and hopefully enables them to put in more effort on the assignment because it wouldn't feel as much like a school task 
119	Student-designed projects could focus on what students question or wonder about in their day to day lives, peaking their interests and making the task feel more fun and creative. Students could receive a broad outline like 'write an essay' or 'create a display', and turn it into a unique piece that expresses themselves; something like a paper on endangered animals. 
120	During summer a lot of trips and vacations are taken whether with family or friends, near or far. Nevertheless, each one requires people to leave their homes and travel with the minimal amount necessary to save space. In my experience, I once was gone for almost the entire summer. One week I was in Pennsylvania with my relatives and the next I was swimming in the crystal clear waters of the Bahamas. Now imagine if these vacations, no matter how long the duration, were to be taken away from students because of a teacher-designed, summer project. If one was to receive a project of this type, there is no way of telling how much time or the location required to get it done. For example, if teachers were to design a summer research paper on the history of where you live, it might be necessary to go to the public library to view history records. No one can do that or go there if they're skiing all the way in Colorado. 
121	Some, especially teachers, might argue that having students design their own summer projects will lead to the minimal work necessary and a poorly done assignment. Teachers might say that students are primarily focused on their summers and just having fun, rather than getting something done that could benefit them in their next school yea 
122	However, if the project is required for school, that typically means it is graded. Students won't try to do the least amount work possible just to save them time, if that means they will earn a D on the project. They will start the year off poorly. The overall effect of the project will outweigh how much time and effort is put into it. 
123	Overall, student-designed projects would be more beneficial for both teachers and students because these types of assignments create a unique idea of who you are as a person because it shows individual interests. If a project was deemed boring and just based on facts, teachers would be more likely to receive non creative and possibly plagiarized work. Students wouldn't care to try their best because this one task is taking time out of their long awaited break from school. In addition, student-designed projects also allow teachers assigning them, to have a sense of who their incoming students are, based on their projects. 
124	Students across all age groups look forward to the last day of school, the day summer vacation begins. From the endless memories summer entails, to the exciting, fun experiences, summer vacation is one of the most beneficial times for students. For many high school students, teachers assign summer assignments or projects that relate to a class they may be taking in the upcoming school year. These assignments tend to require an expansive amount of time and also tend to be rather ineffective. In the summer students want to fill their time with exciting activities that they would enjoy. We live in the age of self exploration with some the most inquisitive students, but we still conform to the age old summer assignment system. 
125	In a new modern classroom setting, students should have the liberty to design their own summer projects 
126	because students are more inclined to learn when they have the liberty to decide their work, 
127	the process of self exploration is the key to molding successful minds. 
128	When given a task you do not enjoy, most people do either of two things. The first thing they do is rush the task to get it over with, and the second thing they do is push it off as much as they can. Similarly, when a student is given an assignment that is not of interest to them, the quality of work is very low. In reference to the summer, this general idea is heightened; a majority of students tend to push off assignments to the very latest, creating lackluster work and also not learning much from the assignment. Personally, I have experienced this repeatedly. When I was given a summer assignment for my English class this year, I was eager to read the book. While, the book was interesting the assignment was extremely long. The intended goal of the assignment was to expand the knowledge and analysis of the book, but after completing the assignment, I felt like that once held excitement and knowledge was gone. If I had the ability to design my own assignment relating to the book, I most likely would have enjoyed completing the assignment, allowing for an expansion of knowledge. This does not only apply to my experiences with summer assignments, but also applies to my overall experience as a student. When given the liberty to decide my own work, I am not only excited to work, but I am also more dedicated. When my education is in my hands, I produce some of my best work. Currently as a junior enlisted in a self led research class, I have learned so much about myself and the overall topic I am researching. Although at first the task at hand was daunting, I learned how to organize myself effectively and complete a thorough research project that I am happy with. By having the research project on my own, I am constantly thinking about it and I spend more time to work. Giving students the ability to decide their course of work is one of the most beneficial decisions a teacher can make for the future of a student. 
129	Some of the most successful people are regarded for their fame and success due to self exploration. In Benjamin Franklin's famous autobiography, he shares his experiences through self exploration. Growing up in a poor household, Franklin's father could not afford to send him to a traditional college education, but through Franklin's own personal endeavors and exploration, he became one of America's founding fathers, discovered lightning, and paved a legacy that is still remembered today. Simple self exploration can start with these summer projects. When a student is given their own freedom, remarkable results can follow. The purpose of a curriculum is to mend our future minds into strong, independent thinkers, so by implementing simple strides of self exploration, schools and teachers are able to mold the minds of successful students. In my own experiences, self exploration has made a remarkable impact. When I was 15 I started my first company, learning everything on my own with the help of a few mentors along the way. Not only did I grow as a person, but my knowledge for business also grew tremendously. Through the use of online resources, videos, and contacts, I was able to produce something I am truly proud of. The work I put in, was time I wanted to because I was truly passionate about what I was doing. That passion is what we need to strive for. From simple opportunities for self exploration during the summer to long term projects, as a society we need to move towards encouraging self education and self exploration. 
130	The overall benefit of students having their education in their hands, outweighs the potential negative repercussions. 
131	Some may predict that students may slack off when given the opportunity to create their own summer projects. 
132	You can help people and animals when needed. 
133	You would also see great places like China, Greece, and other places in Europe! You might get to see the Great Wall of China, too! Wouldn't that be amazing! 
134	You might save lives and meet great people who are talented and smart and would also need you.  
135	You get to travel on seas! 
136	For students, summer projects can feel like a lot, summer break is supposed to be filled with fun times and vacations while projects are almost the exact opposite. Removing summer projects all together isnt an option, 
137	"so when it comes to the question ""should summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed"" teacher-designed projects reign supreme, as it benefits both the student and the teacher in multiple different ways.  "
138	As a teacher, your main job is proving students with a learning experience that will help them grow as people. Having a student design a summer project would not be nearly as powerful as the impact a teacher-designed project would. 
139	Creating a teacher-designed project as opposed to a student-designed one, would be far easier to grade and create a rubric for 
140	. In student-designed projects you have a lot of variety and no one follows a central guideline, however in a teacher-designed project, you can maintain the variety but also contain a set of rules that benefits both the students and teachers, as the students have more clearly defined rules to guide and provide structure to their projects. This also benefits the teachers, as they can easily grade the assignment and provide a fair grading experience. 
141	Finally, teachers have everyone's best interest at heart when designing projects. Teachers will always design something challenging and beneficial to the students education. 
142	Students, especially younger ones, cannot be trusted to design a project that would be as beneficial as a teacher-designed project. Students often take shortcuts or the easy way out and while sometimes this can be beneficial to the students and their education, it is more often harmful then doing it the right way and teaches them to be lazy. A teacher-designed project on the other hand, would be designed with the thoughts of providing an enriching experience to the student and hopefully making them a more successful and educated person. 
143	Teachers play well informed, and important roles in a students life while they develop, and education is a very big part of student development so, projects should be designed with a teachers interests at heart. Because of that, when it comes down to it, teacher-designed projects are generally more helpful, easier, and responsible then a student-designed project would be. 
144	"There are many dangers that come along with studying planets. Along with the dangers, there are also countless benefits to learning more about different planets. In the passage, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author addresses the point that Venus is worth taking a closer look at and focusing on, no matter the dangers it could put one in. "
145	Although many people believe that the author doesn't support this idea well, the author provides researched evidence and past experiences all throughout the passage to support this idea. 
146	"When explaining NASA's ideas on sending humans to Venus, the author states, ""NASAs possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray."" This provides evidence that shows what a solution is to avoiding some of the difficulties that occur when trying to explore Venus. The author was able to support his idea throught the use of NASA and it's research. The passage continues to come up with a plan on the best way to float above Venus when the author says, ""At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth."" This factual evidence that is included ensures that the author is supporting this idea to the fullest of his potential. Researched and factual evidence that is provided all throughout the passage shows how the author supports this idea thoroughly and well. "
147	The also supports his idea of studying Venus depsite the dangers because he includes past experiences that make this idea stronger. 
148	"When explaining past explorations to Venus, the author states, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" Facts that have been presented that occured in the past help the author support his idea that there is reasons why people should look into further studying Venus. These past facts present the idea that Venus once looked like Earth did, and if that is true, there are reasons why it should be looked into further. "
149	"The passage later explains examples of NASA's approached to studying Venus when the author says, ""Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers. These devices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during World War II."" The idea of looking back on past resources to help the studying of Venus would help the process. This past project is a key tool that helps support that Venus should be studied even though it can be extremely dangerous. Using past experiences such as the ones included helps support and grow the authors idea. "
150	Ultimatley, it is understandable why one would believe that it isn't smart to look into studying and experimenting with Venus; however, the examples of the researched facts and past experiences help to support the authors idea that despite the dangers, Venus is worthy of studying. There may be many dangers that come along with studying different planets, but based off the evidence the author provided, Venus has avoidable ways to make it safe to study. 
151	As the end of a school year comes to a close, the summer is just beginning. Many during summer use it as a time to have fun and take a break from school. Some schools though require students to complete a summer project to ensure learning continues throughout the year. This can help to make sure that the student mind is awake and ready to learn when the start of the new school year begins. 
152	creative projects would be produced 
153	it would give students an opportunity to take control of their education.  
154	Student-designed projects would give students the opportunity to take control of their education 
155	Students would learn the responsibility of completing a project without a teacher telling them the process they should follow. The students would have to research and create a project based on something that they are passionate about. For example, every student has their own interest such as baking, rocketry, and architecture. With student-designed summer projects, each student can complete their own individualized project based on their own interests. As to where a teacher-designed project the student has to go with what the teacher assigns. If the teacher is interested in types of frogs, students would have to complete a project based on the interest of the teacher. Student-designed summer projects would give students the opportunity to take control of their education.  
156	When a teacher assigns a project, there are strict guidelines on how the project should be completed. To combat the harsh guidelines, a student-designed project would create more creative projects. 
157	Some may argue that if summer projects were teacher-designed, then the teachers could regulate and prepare the students better for the upcoming school year. 
158	This may be true, but considering that throughout the normal school year teachers design and assign work to students, it would be more beneficial to give students the opportunity to learn how to take charge of their own work. 
159	Continuing to have teachers dictate the types of projects students complete year round will not prepare them for the world. A student-designed project would prepare students better for the world. 
160	Once the students enter the world, there won't always be a teacher telling them how to complete the task assigned to them. Giving students the opportunity to experience independence over the summer is a perfect way to prepare them for the world. Preparing students for the world out of school is more important than preparing them for a few weeks in the future when school starts. 
161	Schools that require students to complete a summer project should make the projects student-designed. Student-designed projects would cause for more creative projects compared to teacher-designed projects, and it would give students the opportunity to take charge of their education. Having summer projects to insure students continuous learning is a terrific way to enhance a students education. But done incorrectly, it can cause a student to dread school more. A well executed summer project would be student-designed, where the student gets to decide on their own project based on an interest of their liking. Making sure that students are positively active in their education is crucial to developing a well rounded individual. 
162	I think you should join the sea cowboy program because it would be a learning experience for all. The sea cowboy programis a life changing expirence that i think you would enjoy! 
163	mandating that students participate in after school activities could improve kids' work ethic. 
164	"a study titled ""Extracurriculars and Students"" by Professor James Wood at UVA proves this. Wood found that 65% of students who participated in extracurriculars said they enjoyed the additional challenges that were presented to them, and actually continued to work harder and challenge themselves not only in their education, but also in the workforce. This means that teens and kids who entered after school clubs and sports teams worked harder and were able to learn how to overcome obstacles and challenges. This also goes to show how students that entered extracurricular activities did indeed improve their work ethic. In general, I think you'l find that this is important because it shows how adolescents were able to benefit from after school activities. "
165	requiring students to join extracurricular activities could help students get into better colleges. 
166	a statement released by Harvard University said that 80% of colleges look for (and accept) students who participated in one or more extracurricular activities. To put it simply, after school activities have been known to assist students in getting into better schools. This relates because it shows how kids and teens who entered after school activities could manage getting into excellent colleges and create a better future for themselves. This matters due to how it shows that extracurriculars can broaden the horizon for students. 
167	It's actually been shown that clubs and teams could improve a students' health. 
168	"A professional from Johns Hopkins said in an interview, ""...Students who participated in activities after school were reported to have a better attitude, more motivation in and outside of school, and possessed an overall healthier lifestyle than their peers who did not join any extracurriculars."" In other words, adolescents who joined activities after school tended to be in better condition than those who decided not to participate in any clubs or join any sports teams. This displays how students have been able to thrive and even better themselves thanks to extracurriculars. Overall, I think you'll find this important because it shows how kids and teens can greatly benefit from after school activities. "
169	"some might argue that students should not be mandated to take part in extracurricular activities, and say that teens may already have a ""full plate"" and thus become stressed "
170	A statistic from the Teens and Mental Health Welfare Society revealed that 48% of students who participated in after school activities reported an increase in stress levels. To put it differently, close to half of the kids they talked to felt stressed due to their extracurriculars. This also demonstrates how a few students are actually pressured by their after school activities. Ultimately, extracurricular activities may stress students. 
171	In fact, I personally was able to learn how to budget my time between school, family, friends, and extracurriculars. While I did have a lot on my plate at first, my extracurriculars like sports, newspaper, and a few of my other hobbies enabled me to learn how to equally set aside time to complete all of my tasks in a timely manner, and still have time to relax. To put it in an alternate way, my after school activities were able to teach me an important skill that I'd be able to use for many years to come. You'll see that this shows that, truly, extracurriculars can teach students how to budget their time effectively. Ultimately, my extracurricular activities taught me an important life skill that could benefit me in many area of my life. 
172	In the end, I think that we should mandate participating in extracurriculars, as it could improve kids' work ethic, assist students in getting into good colleges, and even keep them healthy. Imagine a school with no after school clubs or teams offered to students; kids would be bored, unhappy to go to school with no chance to socialize or get active, and, most importantly, no chance to broaden their horizon and truly reach their full potential. 
173	it gives the teacher a chance to gauge the students academic level 
174	base it on what they will be learning that year 
175	and learn the learning style of students.  
176	Some say that student designed summer projects are better because they allow the student to pick something that they find interesting and that they understand. 
177	And while it may be good that the student is interested in the topic they are working on it sort off defeats the purpose of the project. Because the projects are suppose to be a introduction into the next year and a way for the teacher to learn about the students 
178	A student who is knowable able about history may design a project about Ancient Egypt,but if they already know the topic,they aren't learning anything. And while having the students create the projects may allow for more originality in the type and topic of them. That dosen't give the teacher the view of the student that they are meant to give teachers. Most students will design the project if given the chance to be easy so that they can have a good grade to start the year out. But that dosen't let the teacher see their strength and weakness,and the puts them at a disadvantage because the teacher wont know were the need help till it might be to late. If a student knows they have an English timed writing in Ms. Generic_Name class when they get into school,and they get to pic the book they analyze for it. They will pick and book probably that is on the easier side and that they understand. But if they are assigned a book by Ms. Generic_Name, she can see what skills they need when they do the writing. 
179	Teacher-designed summer projects allow teachers to gauge students academic level on various topics. 
180	The teacher can create different problems bases on different levels of understanding to see which students get what level. This allows them a more direct view then viewing grades or passed assignments because the students may have improved since that was done. Once the teacher can see what academic level the students are on it allows them to create curriculum that allows everyone to understand and be successful during their class. If Mr. Generic_Name has a majority of people in his algebra 2 class that dont understand functions,he might spend some more time on the basics since a majority of the year will be using functions of some sort.  It also allows them to see who might need extra help in a subject and who can do it by them selves. 
181	eacher designed summer projects also allow teachers to give a glimpse into the years curriculum.  
182	Students can get a glimpse into the curriculum of the year from teacher designed summer projects because they can insert preassesment questions to get a handle on prior knowledge or have questions that tie ideas from the previous year into the new one. For example,Mr. Generic_Name could put in a questions about the cold war to see what people know. If a majority of the class has an understanding they can spend less time on that during the year and more on areas they are more shaky on. English and Math teachers can have problems were they have student uses old methods to solve new types of problems. This allows them to see if they need to spend more time on the basics before moving on to more advanced topics. 
183	Teacher designed summer projects in addition allow teachers the ability to see the students learning style and learn them. 
184	Teachers can see the learning style of students by including different types of questions bases on different learning styles. In the projects,they design they could included questions that appeal to visual learners as well as topics that appeal to mental learners. In math and science,they can included different ways of getting to the solution to see which way the student do the best on. This allows the teacher to create assignments that cater to the students. Since every batch of students is different this allows the teacher to change their curriculum to fit the students they have this year so that they can leave successful and ready for what ever next. Not all years are going to be the same, Ms. Generic_Name might have a bunch of auditory learners one year but the next she has a bunch of tactile learners and if she designs her projects to look for that. She can plan accordingly and change her style a little so the students still leave her class successful. 
185	"After scientists did a little research on their own, ""The Face"" turned out to actually be a messa that is common around the american west. "
186	Creativity is the heart of our current society, when given the opportunity those who have the ability to think outside the box create unimaginably beautiful things. In schools students arent given the opportunity to be as creative as they could be because of how restrictive and bland the projects and assignments made by teachers are. If our society depends on the creativity and skill set of the current generation in schools why not give them the opportunity to develop their skills and be able to flourish in their own success? 
187	its helps students learn to become more creative 
188	helps prepare them for the future. 
189	If students were allowed to design these projects themselves it would give them the will and incentive to do it because they would have designed it in a way that it would seem interesting to them 
190	By letting students design their own projects to do over the summer it also helps them develop real life skills that they can use in the workplace. Students dont tend to learn anything new over the summer since they are focused on their break and enjoying it as much as possible but doing a project that takes time and interests them helps them learn what goes into making a project and what the requirements are. This helps students to use their new found abilities in the workplace to much more easily express their creativity since they now know the tools to show it. 
191	Which is why when a student makes their own project they can be more creative and choose a topic or idea that interests them related to the class doing their best effort to portray how much they care about it. 
192	It could be argued that if students made their own projects they would make it easy that it wouldnt take any time for them to finish it. 
193	Although some students would just want to be done with their project and do something easy most students would want to use this project as an opportunity to get their point and ideas across 
194	There is so much good that can come out of letting students design their own projects not only for them but for their future as well. If teachers give students the opportunity to design their own project then they would be teaching more than the class but skills they can use in the future as well. Since creativity is the backbone of everything in the world when teachers start to make new ideas to have students think more creatively it helps the development of new ideas and innovations in the future. 
195	whether students graduate or not shouldn't be determined by an extracurricular activity that they may or may not have done 
196	most of the students already do an out of school activity 
197	Just because they didn't take part in the chess club, or the yearbook committee doesn't mean that they should be held back. Someone could be the next Albert Einstein and focus on school so much that he didn't have time for extracurricular activities, but you decide to hold him back because of a silly little thing he didn't do. Whether students do extracurricular activities or not shouldn't determine if they proceed to learn new things. The administrators should look at their grades and their work habits. It does not make a valid reason for them to be robbed of their opportunity to be smarter, if they just didn't participate in an extracurricular activity. 
198	What if you dont have time? Most students already do an after school activity like sports, or a youth group. Some students even do multiple sports and still balance that with school. So for them to try and balance their after school activities, school, and now an extracurricular activity, it would be chaos. Students already go through enough stress with peer pressure, and their grades, and maybe just problems at home, so they shouldn't have to worry about this too. For example, maybe some students want to get a scholarship through playing a sport,and maybe their really good and actually have a chance at getting one. If you enforce that rule they would have to focus less on their sport and more on the extracurricular activity. 
199	Some students have trouble socializing with others. So maybe they didn't apply for an activity because they just didn't want too. Some students also enjoy their free time, time where they can do homework, be on their electronic devices, or just take a nap. So they didn't want to do an extracurricular activity because they didn't want to give up their free time. Students shouldn't have to feel like they are forced to do something. I mean it is called extracurricular activity for a reason, because it's for extra credit, so it shouldn't be a mandatory thing that they have to do. 
200	Students graduating shouldn't be decided by if they did an extracurricular activity or not,and the students who already do after school activities don't have time for for extracurricular things,and students should not have to be pressured to do something if its not mandatory, so I don't agree that students should have to take part in an extracurricular activity.  
201	"The human body has way more than just six emotions so getting a high accuracy reading on how you are really feeling is out of the question because FACS uses the a process of a 3-D model Dr. Huang states ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles."" This quote explains that it has to use a way of making a model which can sometimes take some time depending on the processing power of the computer not only that but human emotions can change quite quickly and if the pc doesnt make the model fast enough the computer can easly fail at getting and accuarate reading. "
202	Another reason why it is invaulable is that a human is already prepared to read another persons emotions because it is a task that is already done each and everyday. 
203	"Dr. Huang is talking about the device using video images to pick up the emotions of each person. Dr. H states ""using video imagery, The new emotion recognition software tracks these facial movments in a real face or on a painted face."" This quote brings to light that the machine can read emotions but one could say since it is still in new development that not all of the bugs or glitches have been worked out not only that but you also have to devote more resources to keep the machine working which can average to be a heafty hit to your wallet. "
204	"Dr. Huang is talking about how it can change the ads you see and veiw if you dont look happy when you look at them. Dr. Huang states ""For example when a web ad appears on your screen and you smile a similar ad may follow, But if you frown the next ad will be different. A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts. This Quote and prediction of Dr. Huang states that is has potential to keep students intrestred into work "
205	but the problem being is that a program so complex like that requires so much code and algorithms that it requires a beffy computer to run so you would need to make multiple servers capable of holding that much information not only that but the school would have to divert much more of their budget toward stronger computers 
206	"Dr. Huang states Your home Pc cant handle the complex algorithms used to decode smiles"" This saying from Dr. Huang proves that a PC for home use is not strong enough for this program so what makes you average home pc different from a school one other than filters put on the pc which reduces preformance but the worse thing that could happen is what if the power happens to shut down or go out do to a surge that program requires power to run so that is also a big problem. "
207	In conclusion, The use of FACS in a classroom enviroment sounds like a great idea but when you put it in different catagories it fails in almost every one of them you dont need a computer to read emotions when a human is perfectly capable of know how you feel even if it is just a little bit. The schools will need more funding diverted to even run the program and keep it working when schools already have a budget that they have to work on and they will need to be prepared to do something if the power goes out because that system will not run if it has incffecient power. 
208	"The curiousity about Mars has been going on for centuries.  People say that there is or once was life on Mars, and now they are saying that there is a face on Mars.  Humans all around the world have questioned whether the ""Face"" was created by aliens or just a natural landform. "
209	"In 1976, Viking 1 took photos of Mars and found a huge rock formation that remebled a human head with shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth.  This was soon to be known as the ""Face on Mars"".  "
210	On April 5, 1998, NASA's MGS flew over Cydonia, the siting of the face, to snap more picture to reveal that the Face was just a natural landform and nothing more 
211	The Face Theorists weren't satisfied with it being just a landform and tried to find evidence to prove NASA wrong.  The Face Theorists found out that the location and date of the April '98 photo was during a cloudy winter.  Skeptics said that the alien markings were hidden by the haze. 
212	With advanced technology, the right location, and the right season, NASA got the clear picture of the Face they needed to show that it was just a landform.  NASA even suggests that it may be a butte or mesa 
213	Extracurricular activities have been a controversial topic of discussion for decades. Parents, teachers, students, and principals have felt the need to express their opinion on the implementation of extracurricular activities. I attend Generic_School, a place where students have many extracurricular activities to choose from, all of which take place after the school day is over. Some choose to attend and others choose to abstain. I partake in them occasionally, but I tend to go home once the final bell rings. That was before my principal decided that all  Generic_School students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, whether it be sports, yearbook design, student council, or something else. This decree has denied the freedom of choice to not only me, but hundreds of other students at my school with regards to extracurricular activities. 
214	tremendously decreases the time that a student has to complete schoolwork assigned to them. 
215	rather than giving students time to relax, it depletes their energy. Generic_School students are tired as it is. 
216	To understand how fatigued they are, allow me to use an example of someone who is exhausted without the addition of extracurricular activities to their schedule: me. I wake up at 5:50, board my school bus at 6:30, attend school from 7:30 to 2:15, get home at 3:00, and do homework for four hours before eating dinner and going to sleep. Add three hours to the mix and I am going to bed at 11:00, giving me only six hours to sleep. Not seven, not eight, not nine, and certainly not ten. Following a routine where there is only time for six hours of sleep decreases concentration, slows thinking, damages memory, and can even stunt growth during puberty. Generic_School students cannot simply adapt to the new conditions. No middle school student can. That is why Generic_School students should not have to chronically attend extracurricular activities because it hurts students more than it helps them. 
217	rather than giving students a sacred time and place to complete schoolwork, it massively decreases work and study time. 
218	"At Generic_School Middle School, there is a particular extracurricular activity called ""Generic_Name's Work Zone"" or ""WWZ."" WWZ is a place where students are able to sit down and complete schoolwork. Those that attend for the sole purpose of doing work choose to do so at Generic_Name's Work Zone rather than at home because WWZ is a silent work area, which should aid concentration. The problem is that most Generic_School students who attend do not come there to do work or to study but to instead play games which can distract those who are trying to work. Trust me, I know from experience. I could not do more than 30 minutes of work before being sucked into my cell phone. WWZ lasts for an hour, only half of which I used for work. That is why I stopped going. However, I do not have that option anymore now that I must participate in at least one extracurricular activity and somehow make time to work without being distracted, however difficult it may be. That is why Generic_School students should not have to routinely attend extracurricular activities because it takes work and study time away from them. "
219	I strongly disagree with the decision of my principal because forcing Generic_School students to participate in extracurricular activities wears them out and decreases the time that a Generic_School student has to finish assigned work. First of all, extracurricular activities melt a student's energy and can negatively impact a student's health and well-being. Second, extracurricular activities lead to students being distracted, ultimately depleting work and study time. Extracurricular activities were supposed to be a way to help students complete work, come to school happier, and get better grades. However, force-feeding extracurricular activities to Generic_School students will not produce the desired effect that my principal hopes it will, and that is a fact. 
220	have more resources 
221	have more experience.  
222	All teachers know what content they will be teaching giving them an edge to designing summer projects for students. 
223	With an understanding of the content they will able to create projects that will be beneficial to the the students. Moreover, the teacher can plan summer projects that include information that the students will learn throughout the school giving the students a head start. For example, a math teacher might give his or her student a math related summer project which will cover topics that will be learn't in the upcoming school year. This makes the project something that will be helpful for the students and keeps their minds working. It will also make their school year easier since they've already learned some topics through the summer project.  
224	Teachers also have more resources to be able to produce summer projects for students to keep them engaged. 
225	Many teachers attend workshops and meetings to learn about ways to make their lessons better. This gives them immense amounts of resources they could use to put together helpful summer projects. They also have connections to other teachers and programs that students don't have the access to. These connections are important since they provide useful information. With that said, teachers would produce better summer projects than students would. 
226	Finally, teachers have more experience when it comes to designing projects 
227	A big part of a teachers jobs is to create projects and worksheets for their students all year long. This gives them experience regrading what the students will enjoy and how to plan the projects. They would also know how to assure that the students are learning but in a fun way based off their experience. Teachers go through college to learn all this, so they have a lot of experience and a good understanding of what projects should entail. 
228	However, some might say students should be able to design the summer projects because they are the ones that have to do it 
229	It is true that students are the ones that have to complete the projects but the teachers know what will be better for the students to help benefit them 
230	For example, a student might create a project where they have to play video games. This would not benefit the students in anyway since they will not be learning anything 
231	Summer break is the most anticipated time of year for students and teachers because it is a grace period that allows for relaxation and refreshment,of one's soul. The summer sees,the mental maturation of many students without the hindrance of a classroom,holding them back. The learning experience offered in a classroom setting is limited only to what the teacher and state permits. Students are not fully able to express their learning passions because they are forced to learn what the teacher permits. Whereas, during the summer students are free to conduct their own personal investigations on topics that peak their interest, resulting in a much maturer student by the time fall rolls around. 
232	To coincide with the theme of change and growth summer promotes, students should have the ability to choose their own projects, to further their educational experience and mental development, without the influence of a teacher.  
233	The ability for students to choose their own summer projects would enhance their outlook on education,because they would study topics that interest them,and not teacher selected topics that would seem like a task. 
234	It is a scientifically proven fact that students retain knowledge that speaks to their own curiosities and that holds the most relevance to them. During the summer, many students travel to new places or try new things. For example, last summer I was blessed with the opportunity to travel to Japan with my friends and family. While I was there I tried new cuisines,participated in festivities and I was able to learn about their history. My time in Japan, sparked an interest that I never knew I had in Japanese Geisha. I spent hours upon hours researching everything I could on them. But, my research was limited because I had to complete an AP Human Geography summer assignment administered by my future teacher. My assignment was to write a paper and create a brochure about a country. I thought it would be a perfect opportunity to write all about my trip to Japan. That is until I realized the teacher had already selected countries based on our last names. I was stuck with Great Britain, a country I already had a lot of knowledge of from history class and videos. I like many students completed the assignment without gaining any new information because doing the project felt as if it were a chore. Though,I do still remember the information I learned from conducting my own research into Geisha. 
235	Many teachers would argue that a student designed summer project would lack information or seem to rushed. 
236	Which would not be the case at all. Many students would take their time in crafting a project that meets all standards and would probably write more than what is expected, due to the project peaking their interest. Teachers would in fact, see an increase of higher marks. However, if a teacher feels that the project is not up to standards they could always low score it and have the student try again. In allowing students to design their own project teachers will receive projects that exceed all requirements due to the students behind the projects being interested in what they were learning. 
237	If students were able to create their own summer projects, the result would be a more creative,responsible and independent thinking person 
238	Which is great in theory,but not in the long run. It does not benefit the student to have a guideline or rubric, it only benefits the teacher because the projects would be easier to grade. 
239	In the future, once students start working, supervisors will not give them examples of how to properly execute a project. For example, my mother is a graphic designer who is required to come with new ideas for campaigns, brochures and websites. Her boss isn't giving her instructions on how to complete the tasks, at all. She must be responsible in using her mind to come up with creative new ideas that she thinks would satisfy her boss. However, at her old job all the graphic designers were given an example they had to follow. Which resulted in the closing of her old company because they only produced the same design. Luckily for mom, she was able to find another job fast because she was to create designs without assistance. The skills my mother used to think creatively and on her own, was taught in school. But, with teachers designing projects, students get used to a formula they have to follow and are not taking responsibility for their own thinking. Students creating their own summer projects would force students to take time and think of a project that they think would satisfy their teacher. It would stimulate new thoughts and force them to activate the create side of their brain that has not been used for a while,due to teachers constantly creating a rubric and examples for the student. The summer is a perfect opportunity for a student designed project because they would have time to develop their thoughts. Teachers shouldn't design summer projects because it aides in diminishing a student's ability to creatively solve projects. 
240	Students should have the ability to create their own summer assignments because it would promote mental and educational growth that would otherwise be hindered in a classroom setting. Summer break allows students to embark on new experiences that can further expand their knowledge on topics that interest them. It would also allow more time for students to develop their ideas for the project. Which would strengthen their creativity and responsibility skills. Student designed projects would help grow character.                   
241	People have studied the many planets in our solar system and are fastinated by them. People have also studied the solar system to help explore and give information about the planets around us. One planet that scientists have studied for a good amount of time is Venus since it shows that at one time, the planet might have inhabited living organisms. However, Venus is a very dangerous planet since many attempts of landing spacecraft has failed on Venus and the clouds of the planet are made of sulfuric acid. Venus is not worth the pursuit of knowledge since the planet has a very dangerous enviorment for humans and that not a single spacecraft has landed safely on the planet and returned. 
242	According to the article, 97 percent of the atmosphere of Venus is carbon dioxide, which is unable to be breathed by humans. Another detail the article states is that on the surface of the planet, the average temperatures is over eight hundred degrees. The climate and enviorment of Venus is too dangerous for exploration. The planet does not hold nowhere near a safe enviorment for people or even machine. 
243	The article says, ¨... humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world,¨ and then says ¨... since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours.¨ If a spacecraft made by people can not survive the landing on Venus numerous times, how can we even come close to surviving the trip? Venus is too dangerous to explore and it is a waste to even send a spacecraft. The spacecrafts cost a good amount of money to make and for them to be wasted on a inhospitable planet is not worth the information we would achieve.  
244	NASA has came up with a ¨solution¨ of the problemof gaining knowledge of Venus which is for a vehicle to hover over Venus and scientists would safely observe the planet that way. 
245	However, the article says that this can only give us a limited amount of information on Venus since the planet has a very dense atmosphere. The effort of creating a vehicle to hover the planet only to gain bits of knowledge is redundant and is not going the benefit anyone´s cause.  
246	Venus is not worth the time, effort and resources to explore. The planet proves to be too dangerous for mankind and even for machines. Curiosity is not sufficiant enough of a reason to explore and learn about a inhospitable planet unless it is going to benefit mankind more than what it costed to gain that information. The resources that are going to Venus should be redirected to another cause that will benefit society and life as we know it. 
247	The direction the researchers are taking are great, but the choice of where to put it needs to be different. Just putting it into a classroom would be a waste of time and money. 
248	There is so much wasted potential if the system is put into a classroom.  we could use this technology for bigger and better things. For instance better facial recognition security systems so it can be more accurate reading faces and does not open or let in anyone that looks like the person. Or lock the person out of anything that is protected by facial recognition. Another example of how this could be useful in other ways is the facial recognition can be used in the police force to find a match of a person that was caught on camera to be tracked down and captured. 
249	I believe that participating in extracurricular activities has many benefits on a child's social life 
250	Making friends while on a team or a club will be much easier, the students will have connections with others, and everyone will have something to talk about. Some students may find it hard to make friends, but by being in an extracurricular activity, there are many chances to find a long lasting pal.  
251	"You may think, ""It's nice that the students can find a friend, but what if there is nothing they would like or want to participate in?"" "
252	Well, i'm sure there is something they would enjoy, because there are many options 
253	Extracurricular activities can also help shape students into better citizens. 
254	There are many clubs that help students learn about acceptance, kindness, and taking care of our Earth and environment. Partnership club is where students work with special needs children. These students learn how to accept and help care for others who are a little bit different. Diversity club is where students who are all shapes, sizes, colors, and sexualities can learn about each others backgrounds, and the everyday struggles they may deal with because of how they act or look. Environmental club is where students can learn about how the environment is deteriorating and how we can help stop it from being destroyed. Also, they participate in many community service projects, from picking up trash, to measuring the PH balance in our water systems. Students learn everyday what being a better citizen means.  
255	On social media there are examples of students who have found a loophole in the directions in order to do less work. For example there is this one person who had to write an essay, topic is unknown. There was one rule that was not clearly stated, that being the font and size, the student used that missing rule to their advantage and used a font made up of shapes, something unreadable. As a student I know that students tend to find a way out of work, setting expectations will give students less of a chance to get out of work. 
256	In my experience not all the projects I have gotten have all the guidelines. This leaves me stuck. The guidelines help me determine what material I need to research and how much of it. Sometimes it might even be that I dont know what kind of product I am making to convey that said research. This not only provides lack of a acceptable project but also not giving good guidelines gives unwanted stress towards the student. For example some students I know worry that their project is not good enough to meet the expectations of the teacher, or that they are not doing the work that is wanted. Giving guidelines will provide less stress for the student and with that a better outcome with their project. 
257	Most classes follow a curriculum schedule that the teacher need to follow. Without the teacher giving the project the student might not learn the things required or not learn enough for the curriculum. When I had an online class my online teacher was very good. She provided me with enough guidelines that I was able to learn the material needed for me to pass the class. Having the teacher design the project will make sure that the student learns the material required for the curriculum. 
258	If my principal ever decided to make students participate in an extracurricular activity, I would agree with their decision. Joining certain extracurricular activities can bring many benefits to students' lives and open up more opportunities for them in the future. Think about all the things you could learn through extracurricular activities. 
259	Joining a certain group for an extracurricular activity can help you make experiences that can open up different pathways for you in the future. 
260	If you ever wanted to pursue a career in a certain field, extracurricular activities that you participate in now can help you prepare for what those might be. For example, if you wanted to pursue a career in a job like graphic design, it could be helpful to join an art club or even yearbook club. When you join clubs like these, they help you build certain strengths in areas that your preferred career specializes in. Yearbook club, for example, allows you to design a cover for the school yearbook, which would in turn give you the experience of designing covers. A poll performed by Oxford University has showed that 76% of people who now have jobs in the art field participated in some kind of extracurricular activity at school when they were students to help them learn more about what their future jobs would be like. It can also be helpful to build experiences for things like college. Many colleges and universities today look at not only students' grades, but also what things they participated in outside of the classroom. The more activities that you participate in both inside and outside of school, the more qualified you are to go to certain colleges because of your strengths. It helps prepare you for different paths in the future. Participating in extracurricular activities such as clubs and teams can not only help you build experiences for the future, but it can also help you discover what you're passionate about. 
261	 At first when you decide to participate activities such as school clubs, you may be hesitant because you don't know if you will enjoy what you're going to do there, but your ideas might change after spending time there. If there was a rule saying that students did have to participate in an extracurricular activity, some students might feel as though they are being forced and won't enjoy their time participating in it. However, a lot of students' viewpoints may change over time and they grow to love the activity that they're doing. These kinds of activities can help students discover more about how they like spending their time. A poll performed on Harvard University students showed that 84% of students didn't know what they wanted to major in before joining an extracurricular activity in either middle school or high school. A similar experiment performed by Generic_School showed that, when the principal decided all students must participate in an extracurricular activity, 92% of students enjoyed the activity that they participated in throughout the school year. It also showed that 65% of those students decided to continue that extracurricular activity the following year because they liked doing it. Schools offer many different kinds of activities to participate in, and they can help you discover both your passions and hobbies. When you discover what your passionate about in a certain activity, it also gives you the opportunity to socialize with peers participating in the same activity that might be interested in the same things you are. 
262	When you join an extracurricular activity, you're put in situations where you must work with and cooperate with others. This type of interaction gives students the chance to meet and connect with new people. Most activities like these use team efforts. For example, activities like Science Olympiad require you to collaborate with others in order to win competitions, it helps you both get along with others and develop teamwork skills. Overall, this can help with your future in situations where you work alongside co-workers. You can even make close friends through extracurricular activities. The students there most likely will share similar interests because they are all participating in an activity that focuses on a certain field that they probably enjoy. Sports teams, for example, give people opportunities to work with others who are very passionate about the same sport that they are. Teammates have to cooperate with each other and work together in order to accomplish tasks. This is similar to most other extracurricular activities, they can help you form bonds with your peers that can last a lifetime. This chance to socialize with others is only one of the reasons I would agree with the prinicpal's decision to make students participate in extracurriculars 
263	"Cars have always been apart of American culture. From the ""...birth place of the Model T; the home of Detroit; the place where Wilson Pickett immortalized ""'Mustang Sally'""(The End of Car Culture, Rosenthal) Cars and automobils have impacted our everyday lifes from going to the store to hanging out with friends, but car usage has been stedily decreesing and for all the right reasons. "

265	"The infamous smog is not only in Bejing, or the United States, but also in The City of Love. ""Paris typically has more smog than other European capitals...[Last] week Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter (PM) per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London..."" (Paragraph 17, Duffer) The city is not so lovely as you'd think it would be, but the trend has cought on in Paris! "
266	"Most people would think ""I could never do that! No one could live like that and still make a living!"" Honestly though, it's been doing the city of Bogota in Colombia, a city comprimised of 7 million citizens a favor. They held a event for only one day evey year since the mid 1990s to improve and ""...promote alternive transportation and reduce smog."" (Paragraph 21, Selsky) Doing this has sparked a revolution of change thoughout the whole city. More people are willing to walk insted of drive to help the enviorment and the place they live in, and the city is giving right back to them! ""Parks and sports centers have also bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut trafic; and new restaruants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up."" (Paragraph 28, Selsky) "
267	Just one day a week could cut down smog and other green house gasses a lot and help our enviroment and the edodomey.  
268	"Back in the 1950's people had to use cars to do eveything. From talking to a friend face to face to going to the nearest resturant. But now you can do all of that in your own living room, due to technology that has advanced us to be able to use Facetime, Skype, or Oovoo to talk to our friends face to face using out phone, tablet, or personal computer. And to drive anywhere we need to we have apps the diliver taxies to our houses for us.""...the Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends...Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps have facilitated more flexiable commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared can services fro getting to work."" ( Paragraph 35, Rosenthal)  Working everyday will effect this because no one wants to miss work. Missing work means less money and creates more stress for the person missing work. By saving maybe $10 on gas that day you're missing out on the $125 you could've made by working, but there's another solution to this also. Car-pool! Even if you're driving the car yourself or you're in the car you're saving fule and money. "
269	By not using our cars as much, we can help ourselves and everyone aroud us by making a better world that makes it better for our children, or even our childrens' children. 
270	Although, cars are used very often and are a useful form of transportation, they are also very hamful. Taking a break from driving isn't a bad idea. 
271	The summer is a time for students to enjoy a break from schoolwork. Most students spend their time on vacation or relaxing. Summer projects may impede on students' time to relax, and they may take away their freedom. 
272	It is the students' break, so they may want to decide what projects they have to do. Summer projects should be student-designed 
273	it allows the students to do projects they are interested in 
274	that work with their summer schedule. 
275	Student-designed projects will interest students more than teacher-designed projects. 
276	If the students designed their own projects, they would be able to design them to fit their schedule. 
277	Many people think that the freedom of student-designed projects will allow students to be lazy and off topic 
278	However, this freedom gives the students the opportunity to turn schoolwork into something that interests them, thus motivating them to do well. 
279	they can prepare the students for the upcoming curriculum, 
280	introduce their style of teaching, 
281	set expectations for work ethic and quality of work for assignments throughout the year. 
282	Some could argue that it is more beneficial for students to design summer projects because students can make them more enjoyable. 
283	However, this should not be the case because it compromises the whole point of summer assignments. If students were to create them, the content of the assignments would not be as helpful. Summer projects are not necessarily about being enjoyable. Their purpose is to ensure that students do not become to accustomed to doing nothing over the extensive period of wasted time called summer break. They keep students tethered to reality and are reminders that the beginning of school is nigh. They are helpful because they keep students' brains used to learning and working over the summer in order to make the start of the new year less painful. Teachers need to design the summer projects to ensure that the assignments retain their purpose and that they are helpful in keeping students busy over the summer. If a student designed them, they would not be as serious or helpful, and they would lose their purpose.  
284	For example, if there was a summer project for a chemistry class, the teacher would want to develop it so that it relates to the upcoming curriculum and provides a good introduction for the year. So, perhaps the teacher would assign work on the basic topics of chemistry, namely what an atom is and what the parts are, the periodic table, nomenclature, and simple chemical reactions. By doing so, students begin the school year with knowledge that can allow them to grasp the later curriculum with more speed and ease. Summer projects are perfect for setting the foundation for the school year, laying the ground upon which the building of knowledge can rise. Teachers are the only ones who can create the most efficient and effective summer projects to maximize their students success, considering they know the material like the back of their hand and they are the ones who are teaching it. 
285	It can be a shock, for some students, starting the school year blindly without any hints as to how the teacher is going to relay the curriculum to them. For example, one teacher may enjoy using textbooks to teach the subject, so he or she might assign pages to read or even a problem set for the summer. On the other hand, a teacher may prefer lectures, hands on learning, or visual learning. A summer project could match the teachers style of teaching, providing a proper introduction to the school year. Therefore, only teachers themselves can create a summer project that is successful in reflecting their personal style of teaching. This allows the students to know what to expect when starting the new year, and can lead to more success, more confidence, and less anxiety about staring anew with a teacher. 
286	Along with a summer assignment, a teacher could attach a rubric, for example, to clearly state what he or she expects out of a student. They can highlight how much effort the class requires, and state that students should put pride and care into all of their assignments throughout the year. If these expectations are not created over the summer, the beginning of the school year could be rough for students if they are not sure about how demanding each assignment is. By the teachers designing the summer projects, they can eliminate any confusion students may have over the summer, resulting in a smoother transition into the school year. 
287	teachers should design summer projects in order to prepare students for the year, introduce themselves and their style of teaching, and set the expectations for the school year. Think about the real purpose of summer assignments: to make sure students are still learning over break, and though summer assignments may not be enjoyable, they are invaluable and indispensable to the school year, so they must be created by teachers in order to assure their effectiveness.  
288	more interesting and engaging for students, 
289	a compelling scientific foundation for its effects on childrens' learning. 
290	This is mostly due to the fact that students can choose the things that better relate to their interests. They become interested in both the project and the relevant part of the curriculum. Applying the information you learned in previous school year is an excellent way to test what you've learned - and applying it to something you genuinely care about is the best test of your understanding. Also, people must be interested in a project before they can be enthusiastic (or willing at the least) to engage with the it, and everyone knows that engagement is a good thing for learning. Students incorporating something into their break makes them even more likely to do it, a fact that has had especially important bearing for me this last year, where it's been challenging to stay on top of the workload. The few times I've taken some days off to relax, I noticed that it was comparatively really difficult to get myself to do stuff when starting again. I feel even more apprehensive if I get out of the habit entirely. It's simple: when you give a student a break, they're more likely to engage in school projects if they feels like a part of their break, so not only does letting students design their own projects provide quality, but quantity. Here's an example which fits perfectly with what I'm saying: I walked into my History of the Americas class at the beginning of the year, and many of my peers who were top students had not finished reading the books they were assigned during the summer and fudged the details on the accompanying paper. When listening to them, the most common remarks were about how dry and uninteresting the prescribed book list was and how having to do it in the summer was an annoyance that they just wanted to put off. Meanwhile, most student-designed projects I know of provide much better learning and motivation. The biggest example I've in my mind when writing this is my experience with the I'm in the IB program, where students are required to complete an  Extended Essay, a 16 - 20 page paper on a subject of your choice. Because I can do mine on the physics and mathematics of a diabolo (similar to a yo-yo), and I spend a lot of my free time invested in this object anyway, I've never looked forwards to a project so much in my life (not to mention I love math and problem solving)! I started last summer by doing some experiments, and have since been leaning towards the math side to discover new math (like the calculus in a Lagrangian) and push myself, actually using what I've learned in school. 
291	The opportunity for involvement and motivation offered by student-designed projects (especially during the summer) is great enough that I believe it would be worth it for teachers to adopt in place of more traditional assignments. 
292	Some people say summer projects have to support the student for the rigor of the following school year, and that student designed projects will not demand the same skills needed to prepare them for the next year. Therefore, teachers instead of students should make summer assignments 
293	But to the contrary, a large body of evidence supports that with minimal guidance from the teacher over the summer, taking longer breaks from hard and tiresome work isn't that detrimental for your learning. 
294	While I realize that student-designed projects may fall short in providing the work ethic needed for the following year, I don't think that's the point of summer work. 
295	The point is that you take a long break to refresh you for the next year so you don't burnout (e. g. senioritis). Furthermore, most people figure out how to keep up with the workload by the end of the following year anyways. And, even if students make it slightly easier, it is still reflective the curriculum - and in the long run it's that knowledge that matters, especially later in life. Likewise, if students can put it off for a month or so, that isn't really a bad thing. Spacing, or leaving what learning and then coming back to it right when you're almost forgetting it, is one of the most scientifically backed learning techniques we know of. In one study, students were asked to memorize words in Spanish, but split into multiple groups. As compared to the control of 8 hours of straight studying, the group that studied four hours, then four hours an entire month later, did over twice as well on a test of that vocabulary after the study. 
296	Because of the clear benefits of avoiding burnout and spacing, it's best if students take advantage of the freedom how they feel, so long as they engage with something 
297	Student-designed projects that can spark student's creativity also help teachers, since it's much easier and safer for them just to let a student create it themselves. Sure, there is a chance the teacher might get it right, but it's not guaranteed. And finally, there's nothing to lose. Yes, kids might cram it in the week before break ends, but remember that most kids already do that. It's fair to say that student-designed projects are a win for learning, creativity, teachers, and students alike that we're missing out on.  Student-designed projects both prepare students better for the next year while helping them consolidate what they've learned previously better than most teacher made assignment ever could, with few exceptions. So, while I don't think that student-designed projects are the key to perfect learning, but they are definitely a part of it.  
298	"Venus, otherwise known as the ""Evening Star,"" is one of the more challenging planets to examine closely in our solar system. While this plant is often called Earth's twin, it is vastly different in terms of environment and hospitability. Despite being the closest planet to Earth at times, no spaceship has touched down on Venus in over thirty years. The dangers presented by Venus are many, but the author greatly supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite these dangers. "
299	Venus is one of the most challenging planets to examine due to its very extreme environment 
300	Paragraph 3 of the article is all about the extreme environment that Venus presents. Venus has temperatures over 800 degress Fahrenheit, an atmospheric pressure 90 times greater than that on Earth, erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and other obstacles that prove challenging for scientists to overcome. Additionally, Venus has clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in the atmosphere which prove to be challenging to scientists. These dangers may seem impossible to overcome, but scientists have been developing new methods to further their knowledge of Venus.  
301	NASA is one organization that has been developing particularly interesting ideas about how to further study Venus. 
302	They are considering a blimp-like vehicle that would float above the suface of Venus to meet the challenges presented. This blimp would avoid the poor conditions of the Venusian landscape by floating some thirty miles above the surface. Conditions around the blimp would still be slightly hot, but the pressure and toxicity would be similar to that on Earth. These conditions are not ideal, but they would be sufficient enough to study Venus further. Another one of NASA's ideas is to use mechanical computers to study Venus. These mechanical computers do not require electronics, and they would be more resistant to the poor conditions of the surface. These new innovations in the study of Venus is what makes the dangers tolerable and the study worthy. 
303	According to the article, astronomers are interested in Venus because it was likely the most Earth-like planet in the solar system at one point. 
304	Venus used to be covered in oceans and supported life. Additionally, Venus still has features that are similar to Earth's such as a rocky sediment with valleys, mountains, and craters. Insight into the Venusian landscape would further allow astronomers to determine how closely related Earth and Venus were. The author also states that humans should not be limited by their fear to go out and explore. In the final paragraph of the article, the author describes how human curiosity will lead humans into many intimidating expidentures. However, the author believes that travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited simply due to danger, and humans should travel as far as their innovation will take them. 
305	The author of this article supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers by stating the insight to be gained from further exploring Venus and by presenting new methods that are making new insights possible. The danger of Venus is extensive due to the high temperatures, extreme atmospheric pressure, and wild weather patterns. These obstacles are being dealt with though by new ideas from scientists at NASA. One big idea from NASA is the idea to use a blimp to observe Venus from above the surface. Another idea of theirs is to use materials that would be able to withstand the extreme conditions of the Venusian environment. All this is in the hopes that futher insight will be made on the planet that once was the most Earth-like planet in the solar system. 
306	To make most effective use of their time in the summer, kids should conduct student-  designed projects. 
307	It's through this process that students will become more engaged with the learning material, 
308	produce higher quality work, 
309	begin to store information in their long term memory. 
310	One of the major gripes students have begun to have with school is undoubtedly the lack a independence as it applies to their learning experience. 
311	"It forces children not only to display their knowledge of course material, but to apply said knowledge in a creative setting that requires a ""bigger picture"" understanding of the given topic. It goes without saying that students will take greater pride in their own work. They'll want to show up on the first day of school with a project that they feel proud to present to their peers.  "
312	When all the work is theirs, students will feel increasingly inclined to show that they have a full understanding and mastery of the topic. Nobody wants to feel left out, and, especially as kids age and progress higher up through the school system, the way classmates perceive one another becomes all too important. 
313	"With recent generations of learners displaying less and less focus throughout the years, some might to disprove the effectiveness of student based projects. ""Given full control over the projects parameters,"" one might claim, ""students will become far too focused on obsolete details like font, backgrounds, and pictures."" Someone who might hold this point of view believes a hands-off approach from teachers will only result in lower quality work and declining focus on the course material. "
314	However, we can observe time and time again in every day life that critical-thinking tasks can teach skills at an exponentially greater rate. Take an athlete for example, basketball and soccer players will often dribble while counting the number of fingers a partner holds up in front of them. Just like in a school setting, this exercise builds good habits and requires people to apply their newly learned skills in unfamiliar circumstances. 
315	It's through a plethora of ways that student driven learning can benefit school systems around the world. More effective forms of education during the summer are invaluable in cutting down the amount of start up time at the beginning of any given school year where teachers struggle to prime their students for the year ahead. In place of the traditional project type, designed by teachers and administrators, more free reign forms of summer education produce a more enjoyable learning experience and prompt kids to retain far more knowledge than they would before. Overall, a shift towards more student liberties in this day in age could see monumental benefits for everyone involved in and around modern public schools. 
316	countries all over the world are trying to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and smog. Paraguay, France, Colombia, and even America is trying to get people to use different types of transportation and reduce smog. So citizens all over the world should just for one day not use a car. One person can start a revolution for their community, city, or state. If everyone all over the world could do this we would reduce tons of greenhouse gases amd smog. We can make earth a better place and more healthy enviroment.                  
317	"Venus is the closest planet to us in our solar system, which means we should explore it. At least, that is what the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" believes. "
318	he does not support this claim very well 
319	as he gives only one vague reason to explore it, 
320	he names several dangers and obstacles of exploring it, 
321	provides very few actual solutions.  
322	First of all, he does a good job of naming the several dangers and obstacles of exploring Venus 
323	"such as the extreme atmosphiric pressure. The main problem though, is the temperature wich as the author states, ""average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit,"" (Paragraph 3). This poses a problem as most metals and other materials melt at such high temperatures. However, the author fails to give very many solutions to these issues.  "
324	The author only provides two solutions to the numerous problems that he previously stated. 
325	"Those solutions were to stay above the atmosphere where it is not as hot, and to create mechanical computers that were more reinforced. These solutions would be all well and good had he not brought up a problem with the first in which he states ""peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only little insight on ground conditions"" (Paragraph 6) thus, it is not a true solution to the problem at hand. But maybe there is good reasons to keep trying to come up with new ways to explore Venus. "
326	Sadly, the author only provides one vague reason for which scientists should still try to come up with new ways to explore Venus. 
327	"This reason of his is,""It may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system"" (Paragraph 4). The problem with this is that it does not go very deep into why it being similar to Earth matters. A scientist at NASA might understand any signifigance in that statement, but an average person might not. For that reason it is a very weak argument. "
328	In short, The author does not support his idea for exploring Venus very well because he only gives one vague reason to explore it and he names several dangers and obstacles of exploring it while providing very few actual solutions. Had he named more solutions and reasons to explore Venus it would have supported his idea far more. He named too many dangers without ways to properly combat them, which is why the author's support for his claim was weak. 
329	It is the last day of school, the only thing on your mind is your exciting vacation and the warm weather, the only time that you are free from teachers telling you to what to do and when to do it. When all of a sudden your teacher says that you have a long and tedious project that is due at the end of summer 
330	Throughout the school year, projects that are assigned by teachers don't capture student's true capabilities and skills. However, if students designed their own projects, they could finally display their strengths, which would lead to an increase in motivation for perfecting the project 
331	Furthermore, students have responsibilities and activities during the summer that may cause a low quality project to emerge if they don't have much motivation. For example, students who compete in the school science fair do very well because designing your own project increases motivation for yielding a higher quality project. 
332	" I once heard, ""necessity is the mother of invention."" This quote is indicating that when their is high demand for something, or if someone is wondering how or why something works, new inventions and innovations are made. When considering projects, the same rule applies; questioning what you are interested in yields innovation that have built this country since day one. For example, Bill Gates wouldn't have founded Microsoft is he didn't research and look into what he was interested in. "
333	This proves that when students create their own projects based on questioning and logic, their is a greater chance for success. 
334	During the school year, everything is designed by teachers: tests, projects and homework. In response to this, I raise an important question, how do you expect us to be the next generation of well rounded and intelligent people, when we have been told what to do and when to do it since day one? The only way to give students this freedom of choosing how to design the project without disrupting normal school schedule, is to assign it in the summer 
335	Not only does this bolster self thinking and creativity, but also it utilizes the summer months, a long period of time, to think about and develop this project.  
336	In response to the question of giving students the right to design their own projects, I argue that in order to increase specific skills, bolster creativity, and gain experience, the best choice is to give students this ability to design their own projects. In general, these skills will help students prepare for adult life, where they will need the specific skills that are full filed through this project. 
337	"Every Summer, as school is nearing an end, the other students and I are ecstatic to have some of our future teachers come into our classes and tell us about what we have to look forward too after the break ends, as well as finding out what lesson we will cover, fun projects, and the supplies we should for the class. What does not please any student however, is when they find out that they have to finish a lengthy assignment before their summer ""break"" is over. Created by teachers who have no idea of your level of learning, nor who you are, students will inevitably feel overwhelmed "
338	The students taking the classes themselves should created the assignment,as even though the teachers may make the plans for the class, 
339	these students understand where the new students are coming from 
340	as well as the challenges faced inside the class. 
341	Although teachers try to fill their summer assignments with care, they fail to understand what the students they are getting actually know. Just because the students should have learned everything from the previous year, most of the time other factors would come into play. Some material was overlooked due to time constraints, while some material was discarded in the depths of the students mind as they felt like they would need it. Nothing felt worse than having a lecture by a ne teacher a material we should have learned the year before, but no one at all could remember it. Having the upperclassmen, who were inside similar shoes to the newer students, make the assignment, they would reinforce what the students will have to know walking into the class day one. Upperclassmen would also be able to address through the assignment what material they never learned that the students would need for the beginning of the school year. Even though the teacher should plan for the students to not have learned all the information from previous years, the upperclassmen, through experiencing the class would be better able to give specifics on what future students need to know before school 
342	Even though the teacher makes the lesson plans for the year, the previous students remember what is actually important for the class. 
343	Many times before, upperclassmen have been able to help me through classes by giving me advice on what material was important for the final tests of the year, ranging from simply names of people we have studied about, to entire units that made up big portions of the test. Some times the teacher might skip entire portions of the class, causing the students to miss out on very critical information. Having students create summer assignments allows them to fill students on what they have to know for the year. Instead of being surprised by content they would have never known about, the summer assignment would serve as a guide for the year, preparing new students for what to come. 
344	Some may argue that it is the teacher job to prepare the students, and create summer assignments to reflect the year, 
345	but the students who took the class ultimately know what the students will need to pass the final tests. 
346	By understanding and experiencing the challenges the class faced before and during the school year, The upperclassmen would be able to create a better summer assignment for the new students. throughout school, not only have i sought out upperclassmen, but underclassmen have came to me asking for advice on classes or help studying. Students for a bond with one another, despite the grade level, in order to survive in the educational ecosystem. Unlike teachers, students know what they need in order to succeed as well as regrets and mistakes they will urge the underclassmen not to do. What else would be better in helping new students for the year than a guided assinment created one of their own? 
347	Summer projects are something that some schools require students to complete. They are given so students may continue to learn, even during their summer break. However, there is a debate whether summer projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed. 
348	While some may argue that a teacher-designed project would give some guidance for the students, others believe that a summer project designed entirely by students would allow students to let them be more creative, 
349	Summer projects should be entirely student-designed to give students a better learning experience during their break. 
350	 First, students can choose a topic that they are interested in for their student project. For example, if a student likes video games, then they would be more motivated to do their project than a summer project with the topic of gardening. The students will be more motivated doing something they like, simply because they enjoy it. No one wants to do a project that no one likes. In addition to that, students may also be more knowledgable in their topic if they are able to design their project. A student could know nothing about gardening and complete a poor project. However, if a student knows everything about video games, then that student can create a very excellent project, because its a topic they like 
351	Student-designed projects allows students to do what they want to do, and have control over it. 
352	Next, with a student-designed project, students can have more freedom in what they want to do. 
353	"Some students may not like what topic the teacher gives for a project. This can decrease the motivation for some students to do it. However, with a student-designed project, students can be more creative with their project, because people like to learn what they are interested in. Freedom will also make students more motivated to complete their projects, because they are free to do anything.. Freedom can also allow students to be critical thinkers. Some students are the ""go by the book"" students. This means they always follow what they are supposed to do and not think outside the box. Student-designed projects allow students to think differently and not just use what they have always learned in school. Freedom is key for summer projects. "
354	If a projects asks for the solution to a problem, then students can choose a problem that affects them. This would allow students to have a better understanding of the problem and how to solve the problem. It would make students more motivated to try to create a solution, because of how the problem affects them. For example, if a student chooses a topic about global warming, most students know about the dangers associated with global warming, which gives that student a better understanding of the topic. In addition to that, the student would be more motivated in doing their project, because global warming affects that student and everybody else on Earth. Having a problem that students can relate to for a summer project would increase motivation and knowledge of the topic. 
355	Students should be able to design their summer projects to give students a better learning experience. The freedom to do anything, the ability to choose a topic, and solving a relatable problem are all associated with student-designed projects. Student projects will allow students to do whatever they want to do and be motivated. Motivation is the key idea for student-designed projects, because motivation is what drives students to succeed. After school is over, there will be no teacher-designed projects, and for good reason too. Students will have to do things on their own without someone telling them to in life. Student-designed projects are the key to a good education for all students during their summer break.      
356	Teachers are with their students the whole year so their most likely to know what each student struggles on, it may not be the whole class that struggles on one topic but the point of the project is to go over certain topics so you won't forget them. The main reason students take test are to see what they struggle on or lack knowledge in and with the teacher designing the project it will focus mainly on those topics. If the students were to design the project they could focus to much on one topic or may not include the most needed topic at all. For example, if it were a math project the student could struggle with their multiplication tables but have more knowledge on everything else, the student could forget to include the multiplication tables or they could just focus lightly on the topic they really need. Teachers could include a guide or some helpful tips to make sure that everything that is to be known about that concept will be there. Students could have payed attention to the topic but still couldn't comprehend it, the teacher could know some tips and tricks to help make it easier for a struggling student. Including helpful tips could also make it easier for the students who have learning disabilities. 
357	Students that struggle with a concept could teach themselves the wrong thing. A student that is struggling with a concept will probably use the internet to try to learn more about it, certain websites can teach the student the wrong thing or probably won't teach them at all. 
358	Teachers can tell the students how to format the project in ways they won't forget it. Students might just write down the topics and not the way to do it or they could even just write down a problem about the topic and later on forget how to do it. Teachers can give the students a certain amount of problems so they won't forget or if it is a written or typed project it could tell the students how many sentences they will need. For instance, if it is a writing project it will tell the students how many spaces they will need, when they should indent their sentences or how they should use certain words. Telling the students how to format the project could even keep the paper neat, if the students were to write all of the topics together they could later be confused on which topic is which. It could even help you focus on the topics you struggle with the most. If the project was being graded formatting could make it easier to point the teachers in the direction of certain topics. 
359	there are lots of cool places to see. 
360	Also you can have a fun time on board. 
361	Third you get to help others in need. 
362	 First you get to see a lot of unique places 
363	You will get to help others in need if you become a Seagoing Cowboy. 
364	First, in the passage it states that I had to feed and water the animals atleast two or three times a day. Second, if you are eighteen you could get drafted. That's another way to help. In the passage it stated that I could get drafted, so they told him to stay there and keep working with the Seagoing Cowboys. Third you also get to help work with the Seagpoing Cow boys. If you are a good worker and kind this would be a great job. If you like the Seagoing Cowboys you will like the fun. 
365	In the passage it states that I had fun on board. 
366	it can bring the teachers and students closer to each other. This would give them the chance to get to know each other and try new things out. 
367	After going to school for ten months, students need a bit of a break before starting up again. Not only are their bodies tired, but so are their minds. Their minds are basically at capacity! So when summer break rolls around, students tend to leave everything they learned behind. While understandable to want to stop putting more information in their brain, students should never leave what they know behind. Students work so hard for a long time, to gain new information and more knowledge. In order to assure continued learning, teachers assign summer projects. Unfortunately, students decide to not do the assigned summer projects because it tends to get in the way of their summer. So, what if the switch was flipped and students could create their own summer projects? 
368	they're more likely to do the project when it's their own 
369	students can express their own creativity, 
370	they will actually enjoy doing their project.  
371	If students could create their own assignments, they would actually do the work to get it done. 
372	Adding to the positive, teachers will have a better impression of what their students do. Meaning that teachers will know how to operate their classes, based on their students and how they learn. 
373	Students will also be able to express their creativity freely. 
374	For example, one student may not be able to color, paint, or draw, while another student is really good at coloring, painting, and drawing. The student who isn't as good at doing those things, may be better at using computers to create things. So that student should be able to complete his/her summer assignment, on his/her terms. Some teachers assume that all students are capable of doing only one thing, which is very untrue and unrealistic. Students should not be limited to doing one thing, in one way. It's unfair that some teachers grade based on how artistic the assignment is, or how technological it is. Everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses. Teachers should look towards all their students specific strengths, instead of aiming at their weaknesses. Plus, teachers should be very fond of students' creativity in their assignments, and grade them based on the student's hard work, the assignment criteria, and their creativity. 
375	Lastly, students will actually enjoy working on their summer projects! 
376	Allowing individuals to make their own projects means they will have the freedom to design the project how they see fit; 
377	furthermore, this may even benefit the teacher by showing that their student has absorbed enough information from the class, that they can detail an entire project about the curriculum without ever receiving any instruction from the teacher. 
378	Students perform better when they are able to dictate how their project is written and designed. if their was a strict code detailing what the project must include, the student may produce a worse report than they would otherwise. 
379	Given creative freedom, someone would also have to apply more of their own knowledge of the subject. Having to adhere to a strict code however, would mean they can simply research the specific topics the teacher asked for without needing to apply much of their own effort 
380	All someone would need to do for a report, if it has strict rules, is follow those rules entirely while putting minimal effort. People could be given a high grade for doing as the report said, even though they turned in a mediocre paper with no real care in the subject matter. There wouldnt be a way of giving this mediocre paper the grade it deserves, because the student did what they were told and they took advantage of that loophole. To avoid this mindless compliance, students should instead be given total and complete freedom on their report as long as they apply everything they've learned throughout the school year. This would be a double edged sword, while they are free to design however they want, they must also put in more effort because they will not get any help or instruction from the teacher. Some may believe that a teacher-designed project is a better alternative because if the teacher has a specific rubric, they can help the student by giving them a code to follow 
381	It should be the opposite, They have helped their students all year, now it is time for them to finish one last report by themselves, to prove they can retain this information without any outside help. The teacher has finished their job, they have taught the entirety of the curriculum to their learners, and now those learners must utilize all the knowledge given to them in one project, on their own.  
382	A test with one chief purpose: to display one's complete knowledge and understanding of the class they have partaken in for the past year. 
383	This should not just be something you can memorize a few vocabulary words and write down a couple notes for. It would prove absolutely nothing if you can simply study for this project and write down what has been memorized. To really take on this endeavor, the students will have to include everything they have been taught over their four quarters of experience. They must be graded on how much they really paid attention and how much effort they put into the class. 
384	the teachers will be the ones grading them, 
385	they will make sure that there is still an element of difficulty, 
386	they know the content best. 
387	One reason why summer projects should be teacher-designed is that the teachers will be the ones grading these projects.  
388	Teachers spend hours or even days grading assignments.  If students designed the projects, it would be harder for teachers to determine what the grading rubric should include.  It should be up to them what they will be inevitably grading at the start of the school year.  Most teachers have new students every year.  If students designed these projects, they would be different every year.  This would lead to mistakes because the teacher would not be as familiar with the assignment. 
389	Another reason why summer assignments should be teacher-designed is that they will make sure the project will still have an element of difficulty to it. 
390	It is teachers' jobs as educators to continue create and assign projects that are challenging enough for the level that their students are at.  If students designed their projects, the projects would not be very difficult.  This would be because students generally prefer to spend their summers doing other things than homework.  If the assignments are not challenging, than the students are more likely to forget about it or not care about it.  The point of summer assignments is to keep the students engaged and learning throughout the break.  Teachers would make sure that the assignment is easy enough so students dont spend their entire summer stressing about it, but challenging enough so that the assignment is still effective.  
391	The last reason why summer projects should be teacher-designed is that they know the content best.  
392	The projects assigned are most likely for the class the students plan on taking the following school year.  For example, if a student is taking algebra 2 and plans to continue on to pre-calculus, the student doesnt know much about calculus yet.  That being said, how would a student design a project for a class they havent taken yet.  The students are there to learn and it is the teachers job to teach them.  The students should not, and could not, teach themselves the content required to know for the following year.  The only person who can properly prepare students for a class is the teacher themselves.  
393	"Writing a strong and supported essay takes more than just advanced vocabulary and a plethora of facts . A strong example of this is the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" "
394	he didn't support his main idea enough 
395	he strayed away from the topic many times 
396	his information is an abundance of opinions and assumptions.  
397	" First, the author brings up his topic of "" Studying Venus is a worhty pursuit despite the dangers it presents"". Despite this, the author only gave one full paragraph, out of the eight he wrote, on why humans would want to explore the planet ; he then preceeded to go onto the dangers of Venus, rather than why it is worth exploring. "
398	Secondly, the author ,many times, rambled on about other points that had nothing to do with his main idea. 
399	"The author gave an entire paragraph about the new technologies that NASA is working on to explore Venus, even though his main idea is about why we should send shuttles to Venus. In the article it states "" Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers. These devices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during World War II"". This entire quote has nothing to do with the topic whatsoever, which shows that the author was gettting side tracked. One reading just this quote from the article would most likely think this article is about computers,and not why humans should explore Venus. "
400	Finally, the supporting evidence that the author did bring up, weren't very factual or even well thought out. 
401	"One of the points brought up was ""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life,just like Earth"". The author uses the word ""probably"" which means that he doesn't know this to be a fact or not. The author also wrote ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus"" ; this is an opinion, seeing as some astronomers might heavily dislike venus. A good informative or arguementative essay provides facts to supports its ideas, rather than just guessing or presuming. "
402	"The author does not suport his ideas well, because he draws the reader away from the topic many times, he doesn't support his thesis very well, and the evidence he does bring up are opinions or assumptions. The author provides to much on the ""danger"" aspect of it, and he should focus more on the ""why"" aspect of his idea . So, it would be best if he looked over his essay and ,with his thesis in mind, start over from scratch. "
403	Cars in most countrioes are the leading pollutants and it could be wise for people to try and reduce smog, greenhouse emissions and diesel use by not picking up tthe keys to your car. 
404	Summer is a time of relaxation, fun, and time to spend with family and friends. Summer can also be a time for a great off season for sports and a time to get better at your crafts. Many parents and teachers believe that the summer should be a time to really work on your mistakes or bad habits you've made over the school year. Whether its studying a subject, practicing a sport, or even working on your behavior. Over the summer some schools assign projects for students to do 
405	I believe that summer projects should be student-designed, but teacher's must approve their work. 
406	Students would have the ability to choose a project idea that they like and not some boring project that a teacher may choose. Also more and more students would actually do their projects because they would choose an idea that would be enjoyable. Teachers shouldn't judge your based on the work that they give you, but on the ideas that you come up with. I think more teachers should allow kids to use their own creativity instead of making students into robots and giving them instructions that they must follow. 
407	In today's society, managers don't hire people based on their high school grades, but on their creativity and their great ideas that they could bring to the table. If you want to become a manager of a company or even an entrepreneur, you must have great ideas. You must also be able to use your own creativity to persuade people to join your company or buy your products. Your teacher isn't going to just come up with your ideas when you get older, so why should they now. The younger you are at learning how to come up with your own ideas and how to be more creative, the more you're going to flourish as you get older.  
408	Some may say that teacher-designed summer projects would be better because it may be harder and challenge the students more. Also teacher-designed projects may relate to school more and what they might learn in the future because many teachers have a lot of experience. Student's may also have a hard time coming up with their own ideas and could take longer 
409	In the future, our society isn't going to change based on what students get on their exams, but on the ideas that they come up with. Our ideas will truly affect the belief's of our society. This is why I think teacher's should allow students to come up with their own project designs so that they will learn how to use their creativity in order to benefit themselves, but more importantly, how to benefit others. I've already seen so many younger people use their ideas to better help our environments and create less pollution in the homes of animals. I think our world can continue to improve and become a better place by the ideas that we come up using our creativity.  
410	I do not believe students should be made to do anything outside of the curriculum by their education system. The mere concept of this rule being enforced shows a lack of understanding or compassion from schools. 
411	"Clubs like ""We the People"" are great for those who are interested in American history or writing, and playing sports is perfect for exercise, to no one's surprise. They are a wonderful way of expanding horizons, making friends and exploring new things. "
412	But that's exactly how they should remain:  extracurricular.  As in, outside of the required learning and entirely optional. 
413	Students should be free to choose whether they do or don't participate in activities outside of the standard school day. If a student's parents require him or her to do a club or sport, however, that is a very different case. Parents have a say in what their child does, and they have every right to decide if the student will participate in any type of organization. Schools do not and should not have the same level of involvement. 
414	turning extracurricular activities into a mandatory affair is either a waste of student time or class time. 
415	Although making clubs compulsory perhaps sounded like a good idea, not only is it a bad one, it's a time-wasting one.  If every single student will do an extra activity, then by that logic, schools would just add an hour to the school day, which I know would not go over well with many. Besides, students already have significant amounts of homework from various classes. Adding another obligatory activity to dedicate time to could very well be too much. Making extracurricular activities mandatory is also just disrespectful to many family's schedules. Maybe a student had already been participating in a separate, unrelated activity or organization. It could be that the student has a religious practice after school, or he or she has to take care of a family member. The examples are endless. Nevertheless, schools should not take up student's time outside of school any more than they already do. 
416	if the school system somehow managed to squeeze in enough time for an extracurricular activity for everybody without adding any time to the school day, it could potentially be wasteful of the teacher's already limited teaching time. 
417	I firmly believe that making extracurricular activities compulsory for students is not a good idea. Those activities are meant to be optional, and if every student were to do them schools would have to monopolize everybody's personal time by extending the school day, drain the little instructional time teachers have by shortening their classes, or elongate the entire school year. While at first it may seem like a terrific idea, various cracks start to reveal themselves at second glance. In the end, I don't think the idea would have worked.     
418	Over the years many schools have assigned summer projects as a way to help keep students minds active while on break. These projects can include reflection essays, construction, reading catalogs, and many other wonderful things. At the moment many of these projects are designed by the teachers, however many schools are considering switching to projects designed by the students. 
419	Students designed teacher approved projects would be better for the future of education 
420	they would allow students to think critically, 
421	increase their desire to learn, 
422	tailor projects to their strengths and learning styles. 
423	Most teacher designed projects rely on specific structures and check list drawn up by the teacher for the students to fallow. They do no prompt the students to: think, learn, ponder, and reflect, rather they give students a list of mundane tasks to complete and check off. Critical thinking and complex learning comes from hands on practice thought and refection. Giving a student a complex prompt or problem and allowing them to design the project themselves in order to answer it, stimulates the brain far more than handing the student an assignment where the answers have already been neatly planed and laid out by the teacher. For a better education students need to be able to solve problems on their own and chart their own waters, they will never grow if they are always defendant on a teacher to tell them what to do and how to do it.  
424	"Often times struggling students or children who ""hate"" school may just feel bored and there are many students who don't try in school because they feel like the subjects they study have no purpose or that it will have no value for their future career. These students often do not participate in teacher designed summer projects as many see summer as their time off from the burden of school and teacher projects appear as boring and useless to them. If these students were allowed to design hear projects, however, so that they focused on topics important to them there could very well be an increase in their participation and desire to learn. When people study things they like and enjoy the often perform better this can be seen at schools like the Generic_School MATA programs where every student who attends wants to be there and as a result they are active and engaged each day. It can be inferred that if the logic applied to the MATA programs is applied to summer projects, students studying things they enjoy increases learning motivation, more students would participate and find value in summer projects. "
425	While many teachers say no child left behind that is often not the case with summer projects. Because these projects are assigned before the teacher gets the chance to really know the students a it is difficult to adjust to a students specific needs. A teacher may assign project with lots of heavy reading not knowing that a few of her students are dyslexic, or a different teacher may assign something on a topic many of the students are already well versed in so it has little value to repeat it. Student designed projects would avoid these conflicts as the students know themselves best and could be able to tailor their project to their strengths. Many English classes have already found success in doing this where instead of assigning books that students may have already read or are difficult for some to read, these classes allow students to study books of their choice or listen to audio books. Student designed projects are often more applicable to students lives and as a result they are a better form of education and learning than teacher designed projects. 
426	Some may contradict that student designed projects would promote laziness and the students would not learn anything of value from them. This is why these projects would have to be teacher approved; 
427	however, even if they are not the value of learning to think and the other benefits of student designed projects outweighs the over specified structure of the teacher designed projects. 
428	In the end student designed projects are most beneficial to students due to their freedom to allow for critical thinking, the study of subjects students enjoy increasing learning motivations, and their unique ability to be tailored to each students needs.  
429	Computers don't have emotions, but you do! Imagine technology that seriously works for you, not only at home but also in the classroom! If technology could accurately read human facial expressions the learning possibilities could be endless. For example, think about that one story that you're forced to read that you just can't understand and brings out all your frustrations, with facial expression recognition you probably will never be so frustated again. 
430	The use of technology to read the emotional expressions of the students in a classroom is unbelievably valuable.  
431	 Technology in the classroom has already begun to advance rapidly with educational websites such as ; Google Classroom, Edulastic, Khan Academy,and Mathia. The facial recognition technology could enhance a students comprehension to maximum potential. 
432	"In the passage "" Making Mona Lisa Smile"" the author states in paragraph 6 line 6,""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,""Dr Huang predicts.""then it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor."",this kind of technology can possibly boost testing score and even help children falling behind instead of holding them back another year. The text also states in paragraph 6 line 10 that ;""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communcation,""notes Dr. Huang."". This example actually explains alot of real world issues in the classroom, such as the fact that some students refuse to even try to communicate their confusion or boredom in the classroom so then they often disengage in the lesson and miss every part that would be essential to reaching standards created by the state. "
433	So now what do you think? Computers advance more and more everyday, however facial recognition may just be the beginning. Learning in classroom has become based on all technology in many different forms. Facial tachnology will broaden our horizons with better test scores and happier students that can understand the material evn better than before! The use of technology to read the emotional expressions of the students in a classroom could be a life changing improvement in the 21st century since every student has different wants and needs as far their education. 
434	Many schools across the country require students to complete summer assignments to assure that they continue their pursuit of knowledge even without a teacher present. But should these assignments be designed by the teacher or should they be designed by the student? If a student were given freedom with their project, it would be a lot more enjoyable rather than if a teacher put strict conditions on it. But a lack of strictness would mean that students are less likely to complete their project and they wouldn't know when the work they have done is enough 
435	Teachers should put that restriction on the student and give them a specific assignment to ensure that the appropriate amount of work gets done. 
436	Students are less likely to complete a project that they have freedom on and if they do complete it, the quality would suffer greatly compared to if a teacher gave them a prompt or a specific task to accomplish. 
437	The point of a summer assignment is to prevent to student from losing knowledge or getting rusty because of a break. Although the point of the summer break is to let students relax until the next year starts, it's still important that they keep their studies up. Assignments shouldn' be student-designed because that would allow too much leisure and when school comes around, most students would not have it done. For example, I had two summer assignments last summer. One was for English and one was for Math. For the English one, the assignment was to read any book of my choosing and write a review about it. This assignment had very unclear instructions and I, the student, was supposed to add my own twist to it and complete the assignment however I wanted to. I started on the assignment, but never finished it because I didn't have the motive since there was no specific prompt to answer to, so I wrote a couple of sentences and called it quits. But for the Math assignment, I had a packet to complete of practice problems. The finish was in sight and crystal clear. I did it throughout the summer and finished it by August. The reassurance I felt that once I did a specific amount of work and followed the teacher's directions, I would be done is what encouraged me to finish. The English assignment was unclear and I didn't know how much to complete to make sure that I was on track for next year. 
438	they are hazardous and in some cases deadly when a vehicle is involved. 
439	"Devices cause distractions that can put not only the driver of the vehicle at risk but also those inside the vehicles, and the people all around the car. Distracted driving is one of the most dangerous types of driving and according to Edger Snyder & Associates, ""the use of cell phones while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes every year"" (Edgar Snyder & Associates ""Texting and Driving Accident Statistics - Distracted Driving""). The sheer amount of crashes involving the use of mobile devices is shocking, and this is one of the main reasons that the use of any kind of device should be not allowed while behind the wheel of a vehicle. "
440	Although a crash may not seem that bad, some of these crashes result in many deaths and injuries. 
441	In a 2018 study from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, it states that distracted driving claims over 2,841 lives (Andrew. currin. ctr@dot. gov 2020). These numbers represent not only the drivers, but also include their passengers and any pedestrians who have died as a result of the negligence and recklessness of drivers distracted by mobile devices. The dangers that distracted drivers place not only themselves but also those around them is completely unnecessary. The dangers not only lie on the road but they also extend to after the crash takes place. 
442	One of the other major issues that distracted drivers face is the financial costs incurred after the initial wreck. 
443	"The people that suffer the most financial damage are the drivers, followed by their passengers, and then pedestrians involved in the accident. Some reason drivers suffer the most is because they are left paying for the damages to the cars and for personal injuries, not to mention their insurance premiums potentially increase. The passengers and pedestrians suffer because of bodily injuries and potential long term recuperation. While they likely do not have to pay for vehicle damages, if severe enough, injuries prevent them from performing their day to day activities and work functions, which may leave them unable to work and without money to survive. The law office of Tavss Fletcher states that ""the average cost for each death in a motor vehicle accident is $1,130,000"" and ""each nonfatal disabling injury is $61,600"" (""The Price Paid for Automobile Accidents and Injuries""). So the cost for the accident far outweighs the risk of texting or calling while they are driving, not to mention the potential risk of injury not only for themself but for everyone involved in the accident. "
444	 On top of the financial and physical pain these types of accidents cause, there is also the emotional pain of the victims and the victim's families. 
445	"When a victim survives and they are injured, they can't immediately go back to work, school, or their normal lives. They need to go to physical rehabilitation which causes strain on everyone involved. Along with this, there are mental disorders that develop after the crash, one of which is depression. According to the Myers Law Firm ""Some physical injuries limit victims' ability to work, exercise, and enjoy day-to-day activities like playing with their children. If you're suddenly unable to partake in activities that you used to enjoy because of pain or a debilitating injury, it's no surprise you may become depressed"" (Myers Law Firm 2020). The victims may have difficulty adjusting to a new ""normal"" caused by injuries. These injuries may have caused a lack of mobility or body function, which hinders them from enjoying typical family or personal activities. Things they loved to do in the past that could be spontaneous or done in a few minutes now require extra time and planning to accomplish. Another mental illness that could develop is Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). PTSD may make going back to their normal day to day lives very difficult. Often time people involved in wrecks will have flashbacks about it, sometimes triggered by being in a car, being near the wreck site or something completely unrelated. Not only is the physical and financial cost of such an accident steep, but the mental toll has a hefty cost. "
446	Aside from the mental, physical, and financial sides of the argument there is also the legal side of it. Many states are starting to realize the dangers of distracted driving and are prohibiting it, and if anyone is caught they will either be fined or sentenced to serve in jail for a short time. 
447	"One example of a state that has made using a mobile device while behind the wheel of a vehicle is Georgia. The hands-free law states that ""A driver cannot have a phone in their hand or use any part of their body to support their phone...A driver may not write, send or read any text messages, e-mails, social media or internet data content""(""Hands-Free Law""). The states understand that the use of mobile devices while operating a vehicle is dangerous, and they are starting to enforce that they need to get it under control. "
448	The use of a mobile device should not be allowed while driving a vehicle. Some states are moving to make it illegal. The accidents cause high financial damage which supports the reasoning of the states to make it illegal. The many deaths, physical injuries and emotional strain that if inficts far outweighs any possible need for using a phone. The final reason that states are making it illegal to drive distracted is because of the high amount of crashes that it causes. It is because of all these factors that the use of mobile devices while behind the wheel of any vehicle should be completely and utterly prohibited. 
449	Summer break is a time for everyone to decompress and relax after a long school year. Projects over break are stressful, especially teacher-designed ones. Breaks should be spent having fun and spending time with family/friends. Students work their butts of enough during the year and shouldnt have to do that over summer. 
450	it'll give students a chance to make the project chill, 
451	it will allow more independence for the students, 
452	it will have a better chance of making the students summer adventurous. 
453	The one thing students ask of the most would be a laid back summer. Because of all the stress they endure during the year, students want a bit of time to reflect and relax. If students make their own projects they could make it very simple. Most may think of that as taking a shortcut through life, but in reality they do enough work as it is in school. If teachers made the projects, chances are they'd want to challenge the students a lot. When projects are teacher-designed students are less likely to complete it. To add on students wouldn't want to ruin their schedule with a boring project that their teacher designed; they'd want their project to be less time consuming during break. 
454	One key factor for students is a sense of independence. Students are growing older and majority of them want to do tasks on their own. Doing their own projects would give them that freedom. 
455	The project could also be a way for them to boost their confidence in what they are capable of doing. It would be a great way for them to see how being independent with certain things is like. Student-designed projects may be a way for students to teach themselves responsibility. It would give them a greater aspect of being able to deal with time management skills. Furthermore they wouldn't be relying on their teachers for specific things such as: making a due date, setting up the project, making specific directions, etc. 
456	Student- designed projects can show one's creativity and imagination. Teachers don't always get to see that side of students during the year. 
457	Yes, the use of Facial Action Codying Stystem would be very useful for students in the classroom. 
458	Not only can this technology detect when a student is confused or bored, but it can change the lesson to grab the students' attention again, or to explain it in an another way. 
459	Along with this, this technology could introduce a lot more job intrest, hobby intrest, or just pure intrest among students. 
460	Lastly, this technology would be beneficial to students because it would give us a reason to be taught about the science of emotion, we could learn and go more into depth about our basic human body and mind and how easy emotions can show.  
461	This technology can change lessons for kids who aren't understanding, or are just completley bored of the material being shown. 
462	"This can greatly change a students grades from bad to good, along with make them look forward to coming to your class or school in general. From paragraph 6 the author stated, ""A classroom computer could recongnize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" Ending the conversation with, ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instuctor."" Another point which dosn't relate to the fact of changing around lessons for a student would be also in paragraph 6,""...if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different."" This technology can overall make a students lesson, web browsing, and understanding of materal a lot easier and it could greatly improve their work. "
463	Secondly, the FACS can show students a different range of technology that is fairly new 
464	It could show some kids something they may be passionate for but never knew of, it could be a possible job intrest, a new hobby interest, anything at all. 
465	"The people using this technology are doing so many things, ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face;"" So they're not only using 3-D software but also, ""Using video imagery, the new emotion-recongnition software tracks these facial movements."" The people who are specializing in doing this kind of technology, are branching out in very large, and impactful ways. Many students could be interested in doing this, and sometimes if it's not in school and they don't hear of it. They can never find it. "
466	Lastly, having this technology in our school would give us a reason to talk about the basic science of emotion. 
467	"We can learn about our human bodies and why emotion is displayed so easily, and how it's displayed as well. ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them."" Our faces can move in multiple ways depending on the emotion we feel, as shown in paragraphs 7-8. Why does it do this? This technology can give us a valid reason to talk about the science of emotion more, and we can learn more about this as students or even as teachers. "
468	Finally, either it be the fact that a lesson can be changed based off of if a student is bored or confused. Or that having this technology can show students a wider range of possible job choices, hobby choices, or just learning more about something out of pure intrest. Or lastly, because having this technology around us gives us a reason to talk about the science of emotion in depth. This technology could be extreamly useful, and impactful on students, if the software being used is good and has been shown to be correct. This could be a very good thing to have in schools that our students can use and to possibly even learn about. 
469	"Authors that present a well-developed, convincing argument can have a large influence on their reader's thoughts. In the passage, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author explains the different reasons as to why Earth, as a whole, should further study the planet of Venus, alotting all its difficulties. "
470	While the kinks of being able to go to Venus are still being worked out, this author gives insight as to why this barren planet is still important. 
471	"""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the coulds of higly corrosive sufuric acid in Venus's atmosphere."" In Paragraph 3, the author does not give a higly convincing argument. Humans need oxygen to live, so how is it expected for them to survive on a planet that has little to no oxygen? It is not possible to change the chemical makeup of an entire planet. The argument displayed by the author is not credible in any way and does not give any reason as to why one would want to continure research in this area. "
472	The next problem that Earth faces in studying Venus is that temperatures on this planet exceed 800 degrees Fahrenheit, a temperature found nowhere on Earth 
473	"This temperature is beyond the maximun limit that human can edure, which leaves behind the compelling factor of wanting to study more of this sister planet. The author also states, "". . . and the atmospheric pressure is 9 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme that anything humans encounter on Earth."" If the conditions of Venus are so bad, why should we be expected to study more of this planet. Similar to the carbon dioxide in the air, there is no way to change the temperature and pressure of an entire planet. Once again, the argument given by this author is not convincing. "
474	The author uses an idea proposed by NASA for humans to study Venus 
475	"They say that they could use hovering vehcles such as a blimp to fly over the planet, somewhere around 30 miles high. While 30 miles is a long way abover the planet, the temperature would still be around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, which is not ideal for reseachers. ""Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" If studying a planet is as difficult as the author is saying here, then Venus should be abandoned because even if NASA was able to study it, there is obviously no way that the planet will ever be suitable to live on. The author's arguments so far have all been a lost cause. "
476	Using software such as the Facial Action Coding System could be valuable in a classroom setting as it could improve the quality of learning for students.  
477	The new emotion-reading technology could help in the classroom as it could make sure students stayed engaged in the lesson. 
478	"Often in school, students become bored easily, due to lack of attention long attention spans, uninteresting lessons, or boring teachers. This technology could help eliminate bordom. In the article, Dr. Huang states that ""a classroom computer could recognize when a student... [is] bored"" which would be beneficial, as it ""could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This means that this technology could tell if students are bored, and could alert the teacher. If teachers knew when their students were loosing focus and becoming uninterested in the lesson, they could change it to bring students back on focus, which would improve the productivity and use of time in the classroom because teachers would not be wasting time teaching students who are uninterested, and therefore, likely not listening. By eliminating this bordom factor, teachers would be more effective with their teaching time, and students would recieve a better quality of learning. "
479	"Often, when teachers ask if everyone understands the material, students who do not understand, will be too emabrassed to ask for help, or the teachers, with such a large class, will not notice if one or only a few students are falling behind. Furthermore, in the article, Dr. Huang states that ""'most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"" meaning that most communication is picked up in other ways, such as visually. Unfortunately, often in a classroom setting, teachers must face away from their students when writing on a white board at the front of the classroom, or in similar situations, which means that without the visual connection, much of the communication between students and teachers is lost. The new technolgoy could help with this problem, as it could identify students' emotions even when a teacher's back is turned, and thus could alert teachers and help them improve their lessons to fit their students' needs. It could also help evaluate emotions that teachers do not notice, such as if a student is confused, they may try to hide it. This new technology could identify these emotions and help the teacher make sure all of their students understand the material, which would lead to an improved quality of teaching and learning. "
480	The quality of learning in a classroom setting could be improved by teachers knowing the emotions of their students, which would make new technology such as the Facial Action Coding System, valuable in a classroom setting. This technololgy would be beneficial because it could identify whether students are confused or bored, which would make class time more productive and interesting, as well as make sure all students understood the material. This would improve their quality of learning, and make school more meaningful. 
481	"""All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change"" (Rosenthal source 1) said Transportation of America official David Goldberg in Elisabeth Rosenthal's article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars."" With air pollution, smog, and greenhouse gas emissions rising all around the world, officials have announced that cars are to blame. With this, many are resorting to making changes in their communities by offering alternate means of transportation and bringing homes and stores closer together. "
482	fuel will no longer pollute the air, 
483	alternate transportation is available and cheaper, 
484	a benifit of limiting our car usage can be found in the better communionship that will result as cities will make their stores closer together and communities more closley knit. 
485	it would be more enjoyable for the students 
486	it will have more diverse topics. 
487	First of all, having students design their own projects would be a lot more enjoyable for students because they have the freedom to choose their own topics 
488	. For example, the famous filmmaker and entrepreneur Walt Disney was not always successful with his work. At the start of his career he drew little art work pieces for a small local newspaper company, although he wasn't able to profit from his drawings that much, he still loved his job because it was something he wanted and loved to do. It can be seen that people are able to go through tough times if they are able to express themselves freely. Another example would be is when my science class was assigned a group project and students had the freedom to do whatever they wanted to do. My group decided to do it on climate change, which wasn't very appealing to me at the time, but as I learned and dug in deeper into the topic, I found it more and more interesting which led to me being more educated in climate change and gaining new knowledge made it was more memorable. This shows that when students have the freedom to choose and design their own projects; it helps students learn something they never knew about, which leads to students being more educated. 
489	Secondly, letting students design their projects will lead to more diverse topics. 
490	Students are always taught to follow a rubric which can be stressful; consequently, students are limited when it comes to expressing their thoughts and opinions. In fact, during my English class, students were split into groups and we were all assigned the same topic to debate about and we were also assigned which side to take on the topic. This lead to students being confused and frustrated because they didn't know what to talk about because they didn't agree with what they were assigned, which lead to the debate being very confusing and vague; students from all groups were stating the same basic reasonings with no interesting details. It can be seen that it's hard to describe or discuss about certain topics when there's no diversity of thoughts. On the other hand, during my history class, the whole class held a debate on a topic where students were given the choice to pick which side they wanted to take. As a result, students from both sides were able to share their thoughts and opinions on the topics, which led to students from both sides giving diverse, different, and interesting ideas and students were able to learn from each other. Every person is different and everyone has different thoughts that people can learn from one another. 
491	Some say that teacher-designed projects are better because teachers are more experienced and know what's better for the students 
492	however, that reasoning is flawed due to the fact that every student is different and some students need more freedom in education. 
493	For example, studies have shown that when students are given work that's confusing or not enjoyable; they procrastinate until the due date and the scores and grades are often lower. However, when students are given the opportunity to choose their own topics and work on what they want to do, they take more responsibility and complete the task on time with a higher score. Teachers being more experienced than students may be true, but giving students a chance and letting them work on their own may show better results. Often times, students are too focused on grades and rubrics, which can be stressful and upsetting when they receive a bad grade for their work they thought was good, however, when students follow their own rules and knowledge it'll be more rewarding when they receive a good grade and it'll be easier for students to find what they lack and need to work on, to improve when they receive a bad grade.  
494	In conclusion, students should have the freedom to choose and design their own summer projects because it'll give the students a chance freely express themselves. Students today have a lot of information thrown at them during the school year and having to retain all that information throughout summer is very difficult, but having students forcefully research and learn about a topic they don't like would be very discouraging and not very effective. Learning is an important part of life, but students should still have the freedom to research and work on something they want to do.  
495	Teacher-designed projects are very intricate and the teachers expect too much from the students. 
496	Many might argue that its good for students to push themselves 
497	but it is summer break after all and students have been pushing themselves for about ten months. These students are tired and adding stress to their vacation is cruel. 
498	Doing a project you're uninterested in can be very bland and boring. Teachers don't think about how uninteresting a topic or project can be to a student. Not having interest in a topic can be very detrimental to a students grade and the effort they put into the project. The same reaction can come from a boring class, students will start to loose focus, dread doing the work, or not put in any effort. I've personally experienced doing a project I had no interest in. I subconsciously procrastinated which lead to turning it in very late. I could not focus on the task and was drowning in work by the time it was due 
499	If a student were to designed the project they could choose a topic they were genuinely interested in. This would set them up for success and they could have fun learning something new. 
500	Summer break is commonly associated with spending time with family and going on vacations. This is the case for most students. Giving students a long, details, mandated project is time consuming and takes away from their vacation. As a child of a divorced couple, my summers are filling with traveling to see my dad and spending time with him. I've personally experience having a summer project that I had to take time out of seeing my Father to do, which was upsetting because I only see him once a year. It's students like me who would love the chance to design their summer projects. 
501	Given the chance to design their summer project students can ensure for themselves that it will not take away from their own plans and it will encourage them to finish it in a more timely manner. 
502	Some schools assign students summer projects to assure they continue to learn during their vacation. These projects should be designed by the students. The projects should be student-designed because teachers have high standards. Due to these high standards their projects require students to push themselves when all year that what they've been doing. Lack of interest plays a huge role in many teacher's projects. Teachers aren't doing their best to assure that their projects spark some aspect of interest in their students. Having no interest in a project can cause the student to procrastinate and not do their best. Lastly, students have complicated schedules in the summer, many go away on vacation or spend time with family. Having a teacher designed-project that's time consuming can take away from their valuable time. Letting students design the project can ensure they will have enough time to work on it and will encourage them to finish it earlier. Student-designed projects can benefit the student immensely in multiple ways, where as a teacher-designed project will let them down and cause unnecessary stress. 
503	Do you remember the space trip to Mars? Well, another debate is brewing: Should we go to Venus or not? There are two perspectives on this issue. They are the people that want travel Venus (the author), and the people that don't want travel to Venus. There are two inherant issues too. They are the need for futher space exploration, and safety 
504	The people wanting to travel to space believe that we need to go to Venus because it is the planet closest to Earth, in characteristics and in distance. 
505	They believe that we need to get up on Venus and study it. There is only so much we can do from Earth, and right now it's not enough. 
506	The author beleive that all of the risks he list in the article doesn't matter becayse we need to take risks sometimes. 
507	The first inherant issue, according to people who don't want to explore Venus, is also a vital part of the arguement. They believe that we have already tried going to Venus, it failed, and why try again. They believe that we have enough information from what we can do on Earth, why do we need to know everything in the universe? They believe that we have already found enough information that we need to know. 
508	"The second issue is safety. According to NASA, they have a solution for getting a spaceship to Venus carefully and safely. ""Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" (paragraph 5). NASA has a soultion for the safety issue that was recently brought to their attention. The people who want to go and explore Venus now believe that this is one of the final steps toward actually getting off of the ground. If NASA trains astronauts well enough, tries to simulate the conditions on Venus, and everything works well; there is noting holding them back. "
509	"The second issue, according to the people who want to stay grounded on Earth, is important for both sides to recognize. The people in the second perspective say it is not safe to go to Venus. We have tried it unmanned, and the unmanned spaceship counldn't live there for longer than a few hours, so it is too dangerous. ""On the planets surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth..."" (Paragraph 3). This quote helps support the second perspective for wanting NASA to kept its space ships from going to Venus. As the quote says, Venus is a very dangerous planet. "
510	In conclusion, the arguement is still ongoing, and doesn't seem to have a clear answer. I believe the stasis lies between finding a need for going to Venus, that isn't just the need for exploration, and a proven safe way to get and stay on Venus. The two perspectives are the author and the people opposing the author. The two issues are is there a need for exploaration and the safety of going to Venus. Therefore, with all the evidence provided to you, you can make a clear decision about if you want NASA going to Venus, or if you want NASA to stay grounded, but the author believes that you should side with him in support of Venus exploration. 
511	Summer break can lead to a fallback in students' learning from the previous year. In order to combat this problem, many schools have projects for the students over summer break to ensure that students maintain the skills that they learned in school. Some of these projects might require a lot of work, while others are less labor intensive. However, one thing is true for all of these projects. 
512	Having students design their own projects will ensure that the project is something that the students actually enjoy doing. 
513	Firstly, because they have choice in what they do, the students will be able to pick a subject or manner of presentation that they are excited about. If the teacher were to assign the same project to every student without allowing the students to have any say in what they actually end up doing, there would defiantly be students who are not interested in the project. Secondly, the students will also understand the project better. The students will have designed their own project, so they will know exactly what the outcome is supposed to be like and how to get there. Many projects are hard for students because they are not actually aware of what they are intended to do, so by allowing the students to design their own project, the school ensures that the students will completely comprehend it. Lastly, having the project be designed by students means that the students will be given more opportunity for creativity. Because the students more liberty over their project, they will be able to use more of their own unique ideas in the project. 
514	 Allowing students to design their own project is also better for the teachers 
515	First of all, the teachers responsible for grading the project will be given an opportunity to better understand their students before the school year ever starts. This understanding is because students are allowed to express themselves more through a project they designed themselves. Secondly, the teachers will not have to worry about making different projects for different levels of students, or about having to make a project that will interest many different types of students because the students will be responsible for making the project work for their level of understanding and interests. Lastly, the teachers will be provided a time to learn things that they would not have a chance to learn otherwise. This is because the students are given the opportunity for creativity, so they may choose to do a project about something that a teacher may have know previous knowledge of. 
516	Allowing students to design their own summer projects is a more fair way to assign work over the summer holiday. 
517	To begin, the students have been completing teacher designed work all school year, so it is only fair to give the students a break and allow them to design their own projects. Additionally, the projects are assigned as work over the summer, so they should not feel like the same work that students are being assigned all year long. Because the students have been working very diligently over the year to complete many different types of assignments from teachers. It would not be fair to the students to essentially continue that trend of assignments into the vacation. Finally, a student designed projects allows for more flexibility. This flexibility allows the students the opportunity to create a project that will be conducive to a busy summer schedule. Many students have to travel or go to summer camps, so they mightn not be able to complete to work which a teacher who does not know the summer plans of a students designs. However, it the student designs their own project, they will be able to make it work with their summer schedule. 
518	If a school assigns a summer project to their students, the project should be student designed. there re many different ways to continue learning when formal school is on a break, but a student designed project will allow for creativity, flexibility, and be better for teachers as well as students. Above all, schools should focus on educating students in a way that allows them creating and ensure that they are passionate about what they learn, if not students will never develop a life long love of education. 
519	Teachers do have some great ideas when it comes down to projects but some students can show more creativity when they can decide on the project they want to work on. 
520	Students also can learn more from a topic they chose for the project for that particular class because they go out to find more information about the topic they think they might enjoy. 
521	it shows more creativity 
522	it shows their learning abilities, 
523	it allows the student to pace themselves. 
524	While yes, teachers usually assign projects so a student does not go off topic, 
525	but this can be easily fixed by simply showing some topics they can use but not forcing the topics on the students to use it and also allow students to find something about that topic or something that can relate to that topic. 
526	Student-designed projects allows the students to make the most effort out of the topic they chose because the student shows that is the topic the student wants to talk about 
527	While yes, the student can use online sources and copy information from that source 
528	they will try harder to explain it in their own words because that is the top the student wanted to talk about and wants to make an effort to show what they are capable of doing when the student is allowed to pick an idea for their own project. 
529	During a project a lot of planning ahead must come to mind the student will have to rush the projects as they would if it had deadlines for each couple of weeks. This allows the student to pace themselves and not feel that their project was rushed and they are not just putting all the work in one day. 
530	The average person uses their phone many times a day whether it be consciously or not, we as a people always have access to our own devices. The problem with people using their phone is when to use it and how to use it properly. When inside of a vehicle there should only be a bare minimum of use to your phone. Whether that reason would be an emergency call or even doing simple things like using the maps application. 
531	All in all, humans as a whole should be able to use their phones but only to an extent. 
532	The use of a phone in a car could be proven to be fatal but there are good reasons to use said phone, only in certain situations. 
533	One of the reasons would be that to use your phone to get your way through areas you have no idea how to get through or using your phone to find your way home from a place you have no knowledge on. The downside is that when the person glances at the phone to see where to turn or make a specific move they lose the focus on the road for a split second which could be fatal. Sometimes the use of a phone all depends on what kind of person it is. 
534	The person themselves also plays a big role in the use of cellphones in the car. 
535	The person could be a maniac when it comes down to how they use their phone, some people can't even live without it because they are so connected to it, for those specific people who have those kinds of issues when it comes down using their phones they should not be able to use their phone at all because they would then get distracted by the other uses. The amount of sheer will they would need to not get distracted by those other things would be entirely on them but in the mean time they should have no reason to use their phone. 
536	Phones play a big role in people's lives and it even saves them sometimes but the use of a phone is dangerous when the person is distracted on their phone 
537	A second could save them from a life threatening accident. The amount of people that are in car accidents that involve phones is 26% in 2014. When the person is using their phone they are putting themselves and other people at risk on the road. According to the National Safety Council, the use of cell phones when driving leads to 1.6 million crashes annually.  
538	Texting while driving would be the biggest issue when it comes down to the use of a cell phone. 
539	According to the NHTSA, driving while texting is six times more dangerous than driving drunk. Also texting while driving is now the lead cause of teen deaths in the USA, more than 3000 teens die each year alone as a result of sending a test message to somebody while they are in the use of a car. 
540	The amount of consequences for just the use of a phone is just not enough, is the phone as important as the person's life? It should never come down to that question because your life is way more valuable than sending a text to someone while driving.                                   
541	In today's world, students are filled with many emotions, some too difficult for even parents to decode. The rollercoaster of feelings that a teenager endures in a day is confusing and complex. But with newly found technology, it may be easier now for the emotions of students' to be understood and assisted, if needed. The revolutionary Facial Action Coding System allows computers to scan and analyze the feelings of a human, alive or painted, and is a very valuable tool to comprehend student's emotional expressions. 
542	This highly advanced technology is able to serve a multitiude of purposes that will foster an improved learning environment for students. 
543	The ingenuity of the computers provide the resources and ability to decode complex human emotions and, in turn, will be able to be utilized in methods that will add to the betterment of society. 
544	The Facial Action Coding System will foster a more positive learning environment for students by adapting their online experience to their emotions. 
545	"If implemented in daily computers, this technology will revolutionize the environemnt and usage of the Internet. Because this technology can map emotions, ""if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different"" (6). With the implementation of this technology, students will be able to influence which advertisements and pages appear on their screen. This will reduce their impatience on the computer, and actually stay focused on the task at hand, rather than getting frustrated and walking away. "
546	With the ability to control the pages on their computer screen, students will feel empowered and influential, giving them confidence and increasing their work ethic. 
547	By allowing the computer to customize the lesson, students will stay more engaged, as the content they are learning is one that they enjoy. 
548	Students will find pleasure in learning the subjects that interest them while also learning about other less-interesting subjects in a more captivating manner. The innovative technology serves to better a student's learning environment, keeping them engaged and interested in the content. Schools will notice increased success rates and knowledgable students. By providing students with the chance to customize the method in which they learn, school will be more enjoyable and students will stay committed to their education. The emotion-analyzing software gives students this chance and will greatly impact the way they learn and the committment to their education. 
549	The highly inteliigent Facial Action Coding System a valuable asset for students in a classroom, as it fosters an enjoyable and captivating learning environment that will shape the students' commitment to school. This advanced software analyzes the movement of a human's facial muscles, comparing it to an emotionless one, and determines the percent distribution their feelings. This innovative software provides students with the ability to customize the pages and lessons on the computer, giving them control over their method of learning. Students with this ability will feel captivated by their learning, as they are in control and can decide how they learn. The development of a desire to learn is crucial for school-aged children so that in the future, they will continue on to further educate themselves and expand their knowledge. This facial  -analysis technology provides schools with the ability to create a captivating learning environment for students that will motivate them to stay committed to their education and reach their goals. While this new technology provides a bounty of benefits to many, assisting students in the achievement of their hopes and dreams holds the most value.

551	"Venus is the second planet in the solar system from the sun that precedes Earth in the planetary order. This planet is often called Earth's ""twin"" and the ""Evening Star"" of the universe because of its brightness and relative similarity to the Earth. In the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author presents facts and figures that one could use to determine whether studying Venus would be an advantageous pursuit even though it would not be very safe. The author focuses more on the drawbacks of exploring Venus, hence the title of this work. "
552	The author does not strongly support the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit due to his extensive reasearch on its toxic living conditions but does acknowledge the benefits of its accessibility from Earth. 
553	"In the early years of space industry, numerous spacecraft have embarked on missions to the planet, but they were not able to return home. Unlike Earth, Venus has an atmosphere that is ""almost 97percent carbon dioxide"" with a surface temperature averaging ""over 800 degrees Fahrenheit"" and an ""atmospheric pressure [that] is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet""(Paragraph 3). Due to these extreme differences in temperature, pressure, and air content, Venus would be fairly inhospitable for humans. Usually when NASA launches missions to other planets they are trying to find alternatives habitats for the human race in the event that they cannot survive on Earth. If humans will not be able to withstand the conditions of Venus it is no longer a good option; therefore, it is not worth looking into since the author provides evidence that Venus would not be a useful living environment in the future. "
554	However, the author has also found that studying Venus could be beneficial considering its proximity and similar geographical features to Earth. 
555	"The Earth comes right after Venus in the solar system, making it fairly close given the long time frame of space travel. Astronomers have discovered that it was also previoulsly one of the ""most Earth-like [planets]"" as it ""was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life"" (Paragraph 4). Venus also ""has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters"" (Paragraph 4). In the event that Venus became a viable option for humans to inhabit when Earth collapses (as mentioned earlier), humans would have already been exposed to some of the landscape there. Although this would make Venus more assimilable, its similarity to Earth does not outweigh the dangers that still come with the planet being an unknown land changing from its previous state. With this evidence the author provides an advantage to exploring Venus, but it does not hold up against the established points about Venus' overall uninhabitability. "
556	"Throughtout the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author presents infomation for exploring Venus being both beneficial and harmful, "
557	but he elaborates more on the reasons pointing to the dangers that Venus poses. 
558	Compared to current conditions of Earth, Venus does not possess the necessary qualities that would make it a valuable reserve for potentially sustaining human life forms. 
559	Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break, but are unsure whether these tasks should be student-designed or teacher-designed. Psychologists have proven that in order for a person to actually remember information, that information needs to be repeatedly tested upon in order to remain significant in the brain. Summer break, as a huge gap in between learning periods, is massively disruptive to the cognitive process 
560	Summer projects given over the break period should be moderately designed by the students themselves 
561	Students in school are constantly coddled, both by their parents and by the teachers in their learning environment. Giving an individual the ability to plan and create their own project is teaching them how to manage tasks on their own 
562	It allows them to take into account their schedule, their own situation. Teenagers in high school spread rapidly after the school season has ended. Some travel, or get jobs, or go to summer camps; while others prefer to stay rooted where they are comfortably. Giving students that ability to decide for themselves how they are going to carry through with working around those activities is necessity. It allows them room to breathe. Putting the responsibility of caring for their own needs in students' hands gives them the much-needed abilities they will need for later in life. 
563	Teenagers during the school year often don't get the opportunity to express themselves creatively and individually. Tasks designed during this time are teacher-designed and often follow a strict to-do list, which mushes everyone's work into one giant puddle of the same idea 
564	Giving students the thumbs-up to style and create their own work assignment suddenly sets the bar way higher. 
565	Students are much more likely to branch out from the boring, black and white school project normally set by teachers. Difference in thought is an important concept that needs to be stressed to young people in society. No person is the same as any other. Setting an individual up for normality is setting them up for failure in the real world. 
566	"Being constantly ailed with stress and work is definitely not beneficial for a persons' health. Teachers especially, who work in an environment surrounded by teen drama and the potential spread of sickness, need time off to recover. Forcing them to plan and grade massive projects during their supposed ""time off"" is unfair to them. During the school year, teachers often have no time to waste to spend with their own children, because they are so focused on having to grade those two-hundred papers for school. Giving teachers time away from the stress of other peoples' children gives them time to set aside for themselves and for their kids.  "
567	"Some people may claim that giving students the ability to design their own project is not ""giving"" but ""forcing"". Students may need guidelines in order to work properly and receive a fair grade for their effort. Or worst case, they simply won't do the work. If a student needs a step-by-step process on how to recount their learning, then how will they expect to fend for themselves once they graduate? "
568	As the school year comes to an end, the school halls are filled with students' conversing about their summer plans, an the joys of the school year being over. However, for many students, school isn't nearly over. Some schools task their students with summer projects to ensure that students keep learning outside of the school year. Ultimately, it is questioned whether the project should be teacher-designed, or student-designed 
569	When a student is given the power to design their own project, it allows the student to grow mentally and help broaden their learning horizons. 
570	It is very often that when a student is told they must complete a project based off a topic that they aren't interested in, their initial thought may be that the project will be boring and difficult. However, when they are allowed to chose their topic, it is very likely that their perspective might change into a more positive point of view. 
571	"By learning about different subjects, one is able to broaden their educational horizons, which may come in handy later on in life. I once new a woman who arrived at college ""undecided"". She was unsure of what to major in, and she was later told that she needed to complete a project in a subject of her choosing by the end of the year. Soon after the news, she realized that she needed to decide on a project fast, so she decided she would join her parish during one of their visits to a poor community out of town. She had no knowledge of how to help the people in the community, but she believed that she would be able to both accomplish her project, and make an impact on these people's lives. Her project was then completed after she spent her summer building ramps, cooking meals, and painting murals for that community. Soon after her project was completed, she decided that she would major in Social Services, because making an impact in people's lives and helping them achieve a better life was something she would want to do as a career.  By being able to choose her project, she was able to broaden all of her horizons and grow as a person as well as mentally mature through her experiences. Once again, if there had been restrictions on that project and it was no longer on a topic of her choosing, but instead she had to complete a paper on politics, she could've spent a couple more years undecided, or she could've dropped out of college.  "
572	when students are allowed to design their own projects, they not only take their time to complete their project, but they pay attention to every last detail, and make sure that everything is done to their liking 
573	It can be said that some of these projects are the result of passion. For example, during my Sophomore year in high school, I was assigned a project based off a genocide of my choosing. Originally I thought I would do this project on the Rwandan genocide, but thought better of it since I was already familiar with it. In the end, I decided on the Cambodian Genocide and decided I would be doing a scrapbook for the execution of the project. At first the research was a bit slow since I was unfamiliar with the topic, but as I learned more about the subject, I found a passion for the project I didn't know I had. I began working on the scrapbook everyday after school over the course of a month. By the time the deadline had come, the project had been completed and was ready to be displayed on Genocide Night. In the end, I was able to score a high grade, and even used my research for a project assigned for my art class a year later. 
574	student designed projects are beneficial for the student as it gives them the opportunity to increase their knowledge in a variety of topics as well as help them mentally mature. When given the choice to infinite possibilities, there is plenty of space for infinite success. Teacher designed projects, more often than not, are usually seen as boring, time consuming tasks, because they are created by someone that doesn't have a students interests in mind. Projects assigned during the school year are solely based on the topic they are learning, or book they are reading in class. However, summer projects should not have that restriction despite the project's purpose of making sure that students are learning. Students should be allowed to take the reigns on their projects, and lead them in the direction that they want to go in. When students are given the freedom of choosing, they are more inclined to learn and retain that information, then when they are forced to learn about things they could care less about.  
575	When the school year ends most students are just exited to know that they don't have to learn, knowing they can just relax, hang out with friends, or party. On the other hand, isn't this just holding them back in their learning process? Shouldn't they do some type of project that will allow them to exercise the mind and keep them learning? Well it is easier for the students and for the teachers when they come back from break and the students haven't completely forgotten everything that was taught to them the previous year, so some schools decided to have students do a project over the summer break that can help these students grow as intellectuals . Having said that, who should decide what project to do during the break, the teacher or the student? 
576	if they have the option of choosing what to do they will always chose something that isn't going to challenge them in anyway and will chose to do a easy topic that they can get done fast, that they already know, or that they have done before 
577	Even though students are the ones doing the project, teachers are the ones who understand the subjects that student should be learning. If you let a student pick a subject to work on over the summer, he could chose something very unnecessary that would have no impact in the students growth as an intellectual, he could say he is doing a science project that would ask how many hours he can play a video game before he gets hungry and eats food, or before he has to go to the bathroom. Teachers who got to know and understand their students throughout the year would know what they could be interested in and would work on during the summer. For students to be interested in something they want to understand how it works and find it fun to do. In order for students to not slack off and procrastinate they must find it interesting to them or they wont work on it. That is another thing that teachers must considered when giving out the projects that their students must do over the summer, if teachers assign the same project to everyone, many of them can get such projects done fairly quickly and not challenge them at all, having it done so soon they didn't learn anything for the project, or having all of them do the same project would just have them copy each other. 
578	Having teachers know their students strengths and their weaknesses, can help the teacher determine what project the student can work on that they will enjoy doing and will challenge them, helping them learn all at the same time.  
579	All teachers want for their students is for them to be successful, in order for them to achieve such success they need to understand and go though the challenges that they have to face and the failures they must grow from in order for them to grow their knowledge as an individual. During the summer break, students benefit from having a project that can help them keep the knowledge they gained though out the school year, and not having to be shocked back into the next school year when they come back and have to re-learn stuff from the previous year that they may have forgotten, after that they can finally move forward and learn new things 
580	The teachers give out this project for the whole purpose that given project helps students move forward, they assigned the project to the individual students knowing what would help them grow without having the summer break erasing everything they learned the previous year.  
581	"Leonardo Da Vinci was one of the greatest reniassance painters of the time. His study of the human anatomy allowed him to create pictures that captured the humna state. On of his most well known paintings is the ""Mona Lisa"". The Mona Lisa is a women that has sort of complacent facial features. She doesn't really look happy or sad. This was the popular thought up until a new technology was created. This technology is called the Facial Action Coding System. This technology is able to deduce what emotion a person is feeling. It is able to do this whothout the person even showing an obvious emotion. This technology can also be implenmented in many spheres of life, including in the classroom. "
582	The use of this technology to read the expressions of students in a learning envionement can help students learn more efffectivly 
583	allowing for immediate feedback from a student allowing for the quick shift of a lesson plan, 
584	being able to help and support students emotionally. 
585	"In almost all class rooms nation wide there is a similar routine. Learn something, practice it for homework and then see if a student is understanding it by taking a quiz over it. While this may be effective, it can be imporved ten fold with the Facial Action Coding System. The technology could understand emotion of students in present time. A teacher wouldn't have to wait to give out a quiz to see if students were having issues. They could teach the subject and then immediatly know if students are having difficulty unerstanding it. Dr. Huang, the creator of FACS, states that ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". If teachers are able to recieve this information, their teaching would become more effective. Teachers could change lesson plans in order to fit the needs of the students, and give extra support and help to those children that are still struggling. FACS can also help excite studnets about learning. This is important because no matter how much a teacher trys to help a student, the studnet will not imporve in anything if thet do not want to learn. If computers are able to read if studnets are excited or bored by a lesson, teachers would add visuals and what not to make it more intersesting to a student. This would make them want to learn, not them being required to learn. totality, the ability to be able to percieve students emotions would help students academically by allowing teachers to change lesson plans that allow for more excitment and understand in classrooms. "
586	While school is a vaulable place to learn new information and facts, it is really a place for children to grow and become more independent and better human beings. While grades matter, the emotional and pyschological health of a student is far more valuable. The FACS technology could act as an army of school counselers. High School and Middle School students tend not to share their emotions, even with their parents. FACS could idntify students that are emotionally troubled, have depression, contemplate self harm or even have mental illness. Once students like these are identified then counselers and social workers could step in, allowing for students to be helped. Right now students that struggle with these issues do not share their feelings. They do not get help and carry on like they are fine. While many may turn out to be okay, even one taking their own life or somebody's else, is too much. While FACS may not be able to help or eliminate all signs of emotional distress, it can surely make a difference. Another benfit of using FACS is that it reads emotoins silently. Students don't have to potray a certain emotion for the technology to understand what they are really feeling. If a studnet is asked how they are, they probably give a surface level, I am fine, answer. The technology reads through that completely, eliminating awkard one on one conversatoins with conselers, and allowing for all students to be reached. 
587	While there are many positives to this technology some might argue that computers cannot actually calculate human emotion. They argue that human emotion is not somehting that can or should be understood because it would ruin the entirety of feeling certain ways. 
588	Emotion is in the brain, not the heart. The way the FACS understands emoion is simple. It maps out a 3-D model of the face, looks at the shape and positoin of all the muscles, then it associates the different facial movements with differet emotion. For example, your orbicularis oris (muscles around your mouth) tighten your lips to show when you are angry. It even works when a person it trying to mask emotions. During a fake smile, the zygomatic major stretches the mouth sidways, while in a real smile the zygomatic major lifts the corners of the mouth. These examples can show how science IS able to understand emotoin, probaly better than most humans. Arguments that use that falshood, that science is unable to understand emotion, is completly false. 
589	In conclusion, the ability to read the actual emotion and reactions of students in class rooms is extremely valuable because it allows for greater understanding and excitment of a subject, along with the ability to help students be emotionally stable. If this technology is implemented into schools, studnets will overall do better, feel better and make a brighter world for tomorrow. FACS is something revolutionary that hopefully all of us can learn somthing from. 
590	. One it can give the student stress, by making them worried about if he or she will pass. 
591	Two it can start a loss in productivity, by making the students' work rate slow down and make them struggle more 
592	Three it will overload the student, because they might be going for a advanced diploma and that would pile on top of the student making it hard for the student to do his or her work. 
593	Those were a few reasons why you should not need to take a extracurricular activity to pass the school year. 
594	by, first making the student get lower grades, because they have to split their focus to two things at once therefore making the student worried about if he or she will pass the year. Second can make the students upset, by making the student do more work then they need. Third it can drive the students insane, by making the students do way too much school work. Those were some reasons why, you should not need to take a extracurricular activity to pass the school year.  
595	First it can make them want to stop trying to get good grades, simply by giving the student a lot of work and barely any time to relax. Second it can stop the student focus dead in it's tracks, just because there is a little too much work for the student to keep going and work. Third  It will also slow down the student work rate and make them feel like they need to study more which then will put the student in a very bad mental place. Those were also some reasons why, you should not need to take a extracurricular activity to pass the school year. 
596	First it can make the student do too much work, because some students are going for a advanced diploma and if they had to do a extracurricular activity that would pile on top of the student making him or her do too much work. Second some student might have other activities to do out side of school so that would just stop them from doing what they enjoy after school. Third it may also make students miss out on certain events that happen every couple of years, like for say you wanted to go to a concert that a band was doing and that was there last concert that they will ever do, you would really want to go, but as long as you have a extracurricular activity you might not be able to go and watch the performance in person. Those were the final reasons why should not need to take a extracurricular activity to pass the school year. 
597	Those are a few reason why, you should not need to take a extracurricular activity to pass the school year. Another reason is because it can cause stress by making the student focus on two things at once therefore bring the students grades down and make the student worried about if he or she will pass the year. Another reason is it can create a loss in productivity by slowing down the work rate of the student making them feel dumb or behind in class. The final reason to wrap it up is that it can overload a student by giving them too much work permanently putting themselves in a bad mental state at school just because of a little too much work. Those were all the reasons why you should not need a extracurricular activity to pass the school year. 
598	Summer break provides students with a time to relax and refresh in preparation for the following year. The break is a necessity in the school systems as it offers students the opportunity to experience different aspects of life outside of the classroom. Additionally, this period to refresh assists students in their learning career as it prevents academic burnout. However, some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during the break 
599	In situations where summer projects are assigned, projects should be student-designed 
600	In allowing students to design their own project, the student is given the opportunity to take charge of their learning. 
601	The initiative a student-designed project offers allows students to choose a topic they are interested in and later hope to pursue. For example, a young student with little interest in art and literature would not benefit from being forced to read certain novels throughout the summer. Exposure to the essential texts needed to further their language abilities will be gained throughout the school year. Therefore, as the school year already provides students with the basic skills to advance their academic career, summer should be a time students have the opportunity to pursue their own interests, best achieved through the completion of student-designed projects. 
602	Likewise, with the idea that a student designs a project on a topic they are interested in, the project will be done more thoroughly, allowing students to gain a deeper understanding. 
603	As a human tendency, people are more likely to work on something they are interested and excited about. The more the project is worked on, the more complex and thorough it will be. Interest and excitement in a topic positively affect the extent to which the project will be worked on. Typically, the time spent on the project is directly related to the overall understanding of the concept. Considering teachers assign summer work to assure students continue learning during their break, projects should be student-designed as they promote a deeper understanding of the given topic. 
604	having students complete a project they have designed themselves minimizes the feeling of the traditional school dynamic 
605	"Throughout the school year, students are assigned the work they need to complete in order to receive an ""A."" Completing work is often done out of requirement rather than personal interest. Summer is used as a break from the many requirements of school. A student-designed project will seem like less of a requirement as it is based upon self-interest. Minimizing the feeling that the work must be done out of requirement ensures students have the time to refresh while continuing their academics. "
606	Even though extracurricular activities are important they are hard for some to do. Many parents and kids nowadays don't have time for these activities with all the work and homework they have to do. 
607	Also some kids have disabilities or mental disabilities that cause problems when they are trying to do activities like football or yearbook club. 
608	Homework is a required part of school and some schools give more homework than others. In schools that offer AP level classes students have about 4-5 hours of homework each day, giving them no time to do extracurricular activities. Kids are stressed with this work, and putting other activities on top of it is just creating more stress. Parents don't have time too because the average workday takes up most of their time, and driving kids back and forth from each activity can really mess up a parent's schedule. An average workday for parents is about 8 or 9 hours and work is hard and demanding for most parents. This is why the principal should not force kids to do extracurricular activities because some just simply don't have the time. 
609	These disabilities cause some kids to have trouble with school work, focusing, and completing simple tasks such as writing with a pencil. This is why it would not be beneficial to force these kids to do extracurricular activities. The rigorous work of clubs like a math club, a yearbook club, or a reading club would overstimulate some of these kids. It would lead to tantrums, fits, and bad behavior from some of these kids, and it would distract the other club members from their work. Extracurricular activities like baseball or football would not be beneficial for them either because some of these kids with disabilities have trouble throwing a ball, standing up straight, and walking if it is a serious case. While it is not a bad thing for kids with disabilities or mental disabilities to join a club or sport, it is just harder for some of them to do extracurricular activities because of their underlying issues. 
610	This is why I believe kids should not be forced to participate in extracurricular activities because while they are beneficial they are hard for some. Extracurricular activities cause issues for parents and kids with no time, and in some cases they force kids with disabilities to do things they cannot do. For example, some parents have work from 8 am until 7 pm and this would not allow any time for drop off and pick up. Also kids have a lot of homework, opening up little time for kids to do extracurricular activities. Lastly some kids with disabilities and mental disabilities just don't have the capacity to participate in extracurricular activities. Many say that extracurricular activities should be required, but I feel forcing all kids to do them is wrong 
611	Assignments that are completed by students are created by teachers, followed by a due date in which it is to be completed. After the assignment is completed the moving on to the next. Over time assignments become a chore and are less likely to be completed by students. Allowing students the chance to create their own summer project that they would truly excited to work. Through their own creation topics that students are interested about can be integrated into the summer project. Even though the summer project could be less structured it would completed time and time again. Having created their own assignments students would better understand what is to be expected in the terms of how to not only completed but also pass. Once on summer break students are unable to contact teachers if they have any questions about the project through having created it themselves this would eliminate the unanswered questions. If students were allowed to create their own summer projects it would give them a sense of control over their learning that is often lost throughout the school year. Some students can become detached from their learning with endless amounts of work that is assigned to them. Through the creation their summer projects it would also allow students to place their input and become more hands on within their learning. 
612	Through creating their own assignments, students are able to build qualities that are helpful in a work environment. 
613	The process of coming up with rubrics and topics in which the assignment could be upon can be difficult. Team collaboration is vital for creating an assignment along side teachers and other students. Having the ability to voice an idea or criticism can be useful not only within school but also in an work environment. Not only having to create but also complete their assignment helps develop a sense of work ethic that is helpful in any situation. Students often rush to complete assignments very last minute and having formulated the assignment they would have a better understanding of how to space out their time to complete the summer project correctly. Along with school assignments this skill can be applied to any work place. 
614	Those who oppose may state that teachers should create summer projects because they have more experience than students and that teachers are able to introduce new topics to students. 
615	Students are often detached from their learning; therefor, allowing them to create a project that could possibly worked on for months can help student regain their love of learning. 
616	Exploring Venus would a beinificail and woth while scientific endver. Over the years Venus has been a topic of study due to its earth like qualites. The temperature of Venus is not as freindly to humans as our own atmosphereVenus is one the closest planets to own planet than most others. Lastly, the exploration of venus can be the next ground breaking scientific discovery yet. 
617	In today's day and age, we are privileged to have the ability to drive vehicles anywhere that we please. The use of technology gave us the responsibility of driving. With that being said the responsibility of driving is very important because you're not only putting your life at risk, but also other drivers on the road. There can be many distractions while you are driving which can cause you to wreck and be seriously injured from it. One of the biggest distractions in today's age is the use of cellphones. With the improvements made to technology, you can use cellphones anywhere on the road, which causes it to be the number one distraction. 
618	"According to the National Safety Council they reported that ""cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year"". They also reported that ""nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. With those outrageously high statistics, I strongly agree with the idea of doing away with cellphones while driving. Also, 94 percent of drivers support a ban on texting while driving and 74 percent support a ban on hand held cell phone use. Having that high of a support percentage shows that are many other people who feel the same as I do. It is a very dangerous problem that is going on in todays day. With myself being a high school student and driver, I can first hand tell you this is a major proem with teens. I see many of my friends and also other students of my school using their cellphones while there driving and putting themselves in dangerous situations. "
619	"There was a poll made by AAA saying that ""94 percent of teen drivers know the dangers of using their phone while driving and up to 34 percent admitted to doing it anyway"". With this kind of statistic just proves the point of not allowing any use of a phone in a motor vehicle "
620	There are many other safe and focused drivers on the road, who are following all the rules of the road. Those careful drivers have also been the victims and ended up being seriously injured from the distracted driving with phones and also many other reasons. 
621	I personally have an example to give with this problem. My Cousin was killed by a driver who was going down a road, speeding in the rain, and also texting while driving on top of all that. Phones being used in motorized vehicles is a serious issue and luckily a law has passed in the state of Georgia, stopping the use of them in cars, but hopefully people will start to follow that law. 
622	There are plenty of other distractions that go on when driving a motorized vehicle, but the use of phones is most caused. These deaths and accidents from distracted driving with your phones can be very managed. If people were to follow the law of not using them in the car and to be more careful then these outrages percentages will become more and more less. Also, I would like to express the fact that there are many options in vehicles that allow you to use your devices via Bluetooth and voice control. So, if there was an emergency you can answer and talk on the phone without even having to pick up your phone and looking away. This concludes my essay I strongly believe in not using your devices while driving and I hope to have expressed the effect is has. 
623	The author very well supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. They are very pasionate about the idea because they provide lots of facts and reasoning to further support the claim. 
624	The author spent time comparing Venus to Earth's surface and features for remote resembalance. 
625	"Later, in paragraph 5, the author mentions how NASA (The National Aeronautics and Space Administration) has ""one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus."" "
626	"This furthers the point more that NASA is also trying to send humans to go visit and study our planet's ""twin"". The author then goes on, proceeding to help our visualization of NASA's plan, telling the reader that NASA would not directly put humans on Venus's surface, but rather have them float in a blimp-like vehicle above the startpoint of Venus's weather and ""avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up ad out of their way."" The author lastly pointed out how, even with the toasty weather, Venus' surface is still survivable for humans, even though it's not full of easy conditions. "
627	The author demonstrates how the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents by explaining many supporting reasons. They make it obvious that Venus is indeed safe to visit under the right precautions and that, with all the facts provided in paragraphs 4,5, and 6, it is a planet that us survivable for humans. The author supports thier standpoint fairly well with all the information they provided, even referencing NASA. This author fairly supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. 
628	will keep them occupied, 
629	allow them to meet new people, 
630	help them find a new hobby.  
631	many students may not be physically active due to the fact that they do not have the motivation or immediate need to be. However, by joining their local soccer team they will have a reason to be active while still having fun participating. Students who do not have any clubs to participate in may also attempt to fill in their free time with unsafe activities such as trying a drug or joining a gang. Extracurricular activities would reduce this behavior as it will fill in this time with safe activities and help students find an interest that they can participate in for the future. 
632	This has personally happened to me during the seventh grade. Crocheting has always been a hobby of mine, but I never knew many people who shared the same interest as me. Due to this, I had always participated in the activity alone. When I found out that my school had a Fiber Arts club, I joined it to see what it was like. What I had discovered was that there where many people I knew who shared the same interest as me without my knowledge. This resulted in me forming closer bonds with them and meeting new people who became my friends in the future. Students should be required to participate in an extracurricular activity because a student joining a club that interests them will allow them to grow their passion while meeting new people.  
633	Despite a student not having a hobby that is provided through an extracurricular activity, by joining a club they may discover a new passion. For example, the Fiber Arts club I had joined also included knitting and felting activities. While at first I was only focused on doing what I was comfortable with, I soon got interested in the other activities that were available. Through this, I discovered new hobbies I still enjoy to this day which other students may also experience. 
634	 Making extracurricular activities mandatory will be beneficial to students as it will keep them occupied, allow them to meet people who share their interests, and lead to new hobbies being discovered. When students participate in extracurricular activities, it reduces risky actions they may perform out of boredom. Joining a club may also lead to them meeting people with the same interests, or even discovering a new interest. I agree with the principal's decision of requiring the participation of extracurricular activities as it will benefit the students who participate in them. 
635	Do you ever think that exploring a planet far from home is worth it? Astronauts take on the challenege to travel to Venus and to explore the mysteries of the planet 
636	Most astronauts from NASA are fascinated about the idea of the exploration of Venus 
637	"In article it says,"" Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it way well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth. "
638	There are a lot of astronauts in NASA that are willing to take on the challenge to Venus and NASA has already been simulatiing prototypes to withstand the conditions similar to Venus 
639	The planet is not just fascinating. it's also really dangerous for astronauts to travel there.  Exploring Venus is really dangerous that no one will be able to survive with such harsh conditions the astronauts have to face 
640	"In the text it says, "" Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" In addition, the article also states, ""Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun."" The conditions on that planet Venus are much worse than on Eath, the planet contains such heat that it is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit.  "
641	executing a teacher-designed project would be less stressful than it would be opposed to it being student-designed. 
642	When a teacher assigns you a project, it has more than likely been executed in the past. for that reason, it will undoubtedly make researching for the project go a lot smoother than it would if you are researching something that has never been done. During the summer break, students are busy playing video games, relaxing at the beach, and hanging out with friends, with that being said it will be less stressful to just carry out a project you have been assigned, instead of having to spend time brainstorming. Not only do you have to discover the project in general from scratch when doing a student-designed project, but you have ponder about how you are going to conduct the project itself, and this process can take days off of students precious summer break. 
643	one students self innovated project will be different from another, leaving no opportunity to get support from other classmates. 
644	Conducting a teacher-designed project will give you the opportunity to share ideas with fellow classmates, for the reason that you will all be working on the same project. Teacher-designed projects also give light to the idea of having a partner. 
645	"Some opposed to this may say, ""I do not want to do a summer project anyways, therefore let me choose the topic"". I agree that the topic of the project may be more interesting if it is student-designed, "
646	but if the project is teacher-designed you will learn more. Student designed-projects will not test the brain as much as a project that they know nothing about will. Moreover, students will be put to the test more if they have to research something that is beyond logic. Even though you will learn more doing a teacher-designed project it still the easier option. For that reason, teacher-designed projects are the better fit because the whole point of making students do a summer break project is to ensure that they learn as much as possible.  
647	although student-designed projects are helpful the teacher should be the one innovating these summer projects. Teacher-designed projects accomplish both being the least stressful and being the least tedious. In that light, they should undoubtedly be the way summer break projects are conducted. This summer break if students have to do projects it should be a teacher-designed project, not only for the benefit of the students but the teacher will also be able to grade the projects easier because all of the projects should be similar. To sum it all up, Teacher-designed projects are the clear winner, therefore if I ever have to do a summer project that is the way I would want it. 
648	"First off, cameras at the time were not as advanced as they are today. The cameras of the day would ""distort the image and it would only capture the major features of the butte or mesa. "
649	"Even thoug hmy colleague still believes in the ""Face on Mars"" to be a alien made structure. I still believe it's only a butte or mesa. With my evindence of the ""Face on Mars"" only looking like a face due to the techonology of the time, the shadows of the sun, the angle the picture was taken, and our ability to see faces when none are there, I believe I have conclusive evidence that the ""Face on Mars is nothing but a butte or mesa. "
650	Making new friends is bound to happen while doing extracurricular activities, you and another person are just going to click and get along with each other very well. Making friends with the people that do the same extracurricular as you can have a lot of benefits. Take this for example; I play football and my friend Generic_name doesn't. So when I try telling Generic_name about the struggles that I am going through on the football team or something important about the team, he can't help me with my problem because he is not involved. But, if I have a friend on the team then he can help me with my problems and I can also help with his or her problems. Overall, extracurricular activities help make friends that can help you through things. 
651	Everyone in life has been forced to do something that he or she does not want to do. No matter how hard the individual tried to get out of it, the individual still had to go through with the assignment. To complete the assignment, he or she will have to give up something. For example, if someone was forced to come in to work on a day off, he or she may have to give up spending time with family. Being forced to do something is never a fun experience. 
652	some may not be interested, 
653	some may not have transportation, 
654	students may begin to stress.  
655	"Participating in clubs or groups are not for everybody. If a student does not desire to participate in an extracurricular activity, he or she should not have to. If the student is forced to, he or she may not do any work. For example, a student was forced to participate in an after school club. During the club, the student would talk out and misbehave. The student was disrespectful to the club leader and acted in a disorderly manner. When asked, the student replied, ""I was forced to be here."" If students are required to participate in an extracurricular activity, a student may not do any work out of a lack of interest. "
656	This may happen because the student's parent could be busy. A lot of parents have to work late. They don't have suitable hours that will allow them to pick up or drop off their child at school. There have been countless times when students would stand outside waiting to be picked up from an after school activity. The students would stand outside for a long period of time. Standing outside without adult supervision can be dangerous for a student. A parent should not have to worry about getting his or her child home safely because the child was required to stay after school. 
657	Some extracurricular clubs and groups require students to conduct a lot of work outside the club or group. In situations like this, students tend to worry about completing all work for their part of the group. For instance, students have different levels of productivity. Some can balance out school work and extracurricular work while others are not able to. If a student does not have high productivity, this may cause him or her to stress about all the work. While trying to balance out all this work, the students grades may begin to drop. This can lead to even more stress than the student can handle. Schools should not require students to participate in an extracurricular activity because some may begin to stress. 
658	Students should not be forced to participate in an extracurricular activity because some may not be interested and may not have a means of transportation. A student may also have trouble balancing out extracurricular work and school work. Though at the end of the day, everyone has his or her own purpose in life. It may be to do big things or some may want to do small things. It is not fair to be forced to do something that an individual may not want to do. Students have the right to choose their own path in life and to express themselves as they please.         
659	Innocent and young, children grow accustomed to the utilization of cars in society. Hot Wheelz, battery-powered Barbie SUVs, Hess Semi-trucks, and other deviations of play-friendly cars introduce the car culture to Americans from nearly the first day out of the womb. Mothers, fathers, aunts, uncles, neighbors, and grandparents depend on their cars daily. This reliance on cars consequently impacted America's environment 
660	However, limiting car usage reduces society's carbon footprint, slowly eliminating the encompassing pollution 
661	"All vehicles alike release carbon emissions into the atmosphere, polluting the air and smogging our cities. Suburbs, especially, rely on automobiles to provide needed transportion. Experts state that car transportation in suburbs ""is a huge impediment"" (Source 1) when discussing ""efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes"" (Source 1). In the car-intensive areas of the United States, passenger cars hold responsibility for ""up to 50 percent"" (Source 1) of greenhouse emissions "
662	"Elisabeth Rosenthal states that car usage reduction ""will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment"" (Source 4), especially in America ""since transportation is the second larget source [of emissions]"" (Source 4). Cutting down on cars for alternative, public, or group transportation provides a solution to the car epidemic of suburban America. "
663	"In other societies where limitations of car usage occured, the majority of its denizens replied positively. In the car-depleted suburb of Vauban, Germany, ""57 percent sold a car to move [to Vauban]"" (Source 1). The influential idea of a suburb without traffic jams and long drives to stores attracted 5,500 current residents of Vauban. Futhermore, car bans in Paris reduced emissions and cleansed the air ""after days of near-record pollution"" (Source 2) and ""five-days of intensifying smog"" (Source 2). During this ban, ""congestion was down 60 percent"" (Source 2), relieving traffic and pollution. In Bogota, Colombia, a ""car-free day"" (Source 3) promotes ""alternative transportation and reduce[s] smog"" (Source 3). One Colombian businessman commented cheerfuly, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" (Source 3) "
664	In America's evolving society, and the evolving global economy, limiting car usage stands benefically 
665	Have you ever found yourself being bored when doing a project? Have you found it pointless because you get the horrible feeling that you are not learning? It could be because it was designed by your teacher. Many schools, but not all, require students to complete summer projects in order to get them ready for the upcoming information in those upcoming classes. Many of those projects are teacher designed which various students tend to dislike because of the singular, required format. For example, many projects require students to only draw pictures, only write essays, or only build structures related to the certain topic. Many of these students tend to lack the motivation to complete those tasks because they feel uncomfortable doing an action they are inexperienced with. 
666	Even though teacher designed summer projects tend to broaden the student's skills by giving them tasks they are somewhat uncomfortable with, it is better for projects to be student designed 
667	have fun while efficiently studying the topic 
668	Student designed projects give students the choice to pick a format they feel comfortable with. This choice gives the student confidence in their ability to complete the project and strengthens a particular skill in use. 
669	"For example, Generic_Name, my niece, decided to do drawings for her summer reading project last year. She would say that drawing her own version of the characters from her favorite book,  Diary of the Wimpy Kid , would helped her visualize the story in her own way so she could visualize effectively when reading books without pictures to guide her. When she completed her task, she felt so confident in her work and even said, ""I'm going to do so good on this project. I know my teacher is going to love it."" Because of this, it was noticeable that she obviously felt confident in her outstanding drawings. She even became a better drawer from it. She turned in her project and got an astounding grade on it. Overall, the experience she had with the project was very rewarding for her because she got a chance to showcase her confident drawings and had the productive opportunity to build on the skill she loved. "
670	For example, two years ago, my former World History teacher, Mr Generic_Name, had us do a project over the summer about the most important events in world history. Fortunately, he gave the opportunity to choose our own format for the project. Luckily for my friend Generic_Name, he decided to complete the project in the form of a song, considering he was very musically talented. Over the summer he would plan when to work on it that best fit his schedule so he wouldn't be stressed to finish the song. He researched about the effects of World War II and finished his song in no time. He stated that it was one of the best projects he had ever completed because for the first time, he felt like he actually learned something while doing an activity that he loved and had fun with. This clearly shows the effects of giving students a choice in designing their own projects for the best learning experience. 
671	Some may argue that teacher designed summer projects give students a chance to broaden and strengthen skills students are uncomfortable with 
672	For example, this year in my AP Economics class, a peer of mine, Generic_Name, said she didn't understand the point of the summer project, which was to pick a book about economics, she chose the book  Freakonmics , and write an essay on how economic concepts apply to everyday life. This is also considering that essay writing is not her specialty. She loudly complained about how boring the project was and how it was extremely time consuming. She even stated she got nothing out of it. Because she didn't have fun, she didn't learn anything and was furious by this outcome. This undoubtedly shows that teacher designed projects make students feel like they don't learn anything and overall, make them feel bitter about the subject. 
673	teacher designed projects don't give the students an efficient way of learning 
674	Some students may find the project uninteresting and because of this, they may not learn the helpful information needed to help them with their classes. 
675	if teachers do include this option to student within the projects, it could give students the possibility of having fun and actually learning while they are strengthening skills they feel confident in. All teachers want is for their students to learn in an efficient manner in order to succeed, but that outcome won't be possible if teachers give out projects that don't include student decision making. If teachers want to achieve this outcome, they should give student different options to format their project in order for them to learn in the most efficient way so they can ultimately succeed academically and in the future. 
676	"The Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions. This new software has a promising applications for a variety of industries. ""Can we actually calculate emotions, like math homework?"" ""How can a computer recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express how we feel?"" "
677	"NASA. The United States form of a dominating space academy. The Viking 1, was in fact NASA's spacecraft that was launched in 2001. The spacecraft was set course for the small, red planet that is simillar to Earth. The planet is called Mars. Viking 1's ""sister"" Viking 2 was supposed to be landing on Mars, and that's why Viking 1 was sent up in space to begin with. While Viking 1 was snapping photos, its camera picked up a weird face-like structure on the surface of Mars. Some believe its a mysterious face that ""so called aliens"" built. I believe that their reasoning is just a bunch of garbage. "
678	What I think that is, is just a simple and natural landform made by the underground volcanoes, sandy surface, and rocks that landed there. 
679	One reason I believe that this is a natural landform is from looking at the photos. 
680	"The ""face"" isn't any perticular shape that any man or alien would want. The landform would be shaped as a circle, square or any other simple shape, and it would not be so ridgid and cracked. If you were to look at the photo furthest to the left, you would assume that it resembled a face, but If you compair that photo to the one taken twenty-five years later, you would begin to understand that to photo was out-dated and that the camera was not as clear as the one taken later. In addition, why would an alien make a structure of a human's face.  "
681	That part of the theory makes more sense if you take into consideration the angle the camera could have been taken at. 
682	"The answer is that they would not. If NASA went worldwide with their ""face"" they would make more money than millionaires or even other space academies. It does not make sense that the academy would keep an alien encounter hidden.  "
683	"In conclusion, NASA is either brave or very stupid not to tell people about their ""face"", or people just want to get their word out to make other people critisized, make other people feel stupid, or they just want to feel like they are correct when they are clearly not. Therefore; This ""so called face"" is not a face, but it is just a land mark that was naturally constructed by the elements and not alien life-forms. "
684	All around the world there is appearently issues with air pollution because of the cars that residents of those places own. There are many programs in place, such as the temporary ban of cars in Paris, France, and the  Day Without Cars in Bogota, Colombia. The efforts of these programs have not gone to waste, because there has been a significant decrease in smog and air pollution in these places. Hopefully in the future there will be many more programs like these to lower air pollution and save our Earth.            
685	"On April 5, 1998 Michael Malin and his ""Mars Orbiter Camera"" took a picture of the face. The picture was ten times sharper than the original and it proved that it was just a natural landform. "
686	people had many reasons to believe what they believed. Michael Malin had to find out the answer and find out what exaclty made it. That's exaclty what he did. He found out it was just a landform that resembled a face. 
687	educators understand what is to be expected from their students within the next school year and can help them prepare 
688	it will keep students' brains actively working 
689	teacher-designed assignments will create an equal learning style between students and those from previous years. 
690	High schoolers are very busy people who rather not spend a portion of their summer completing school work. With the help of their teachers, having the teacher-designed summer assignment, students will have the motivation to work and complete what is being asked of them. Going into a new school year, students could never imagine what may occur or what teacher they may get. It could be an easier course but with a difficult teacher, or a challenging course with a relaxed teacher. Having these teacher-designed assignments, will provide knowledge to the students that they may need for the upcoming class. It will give them a peek as to what they may expect while enrolled. This is important because most students base their course selections off of what their friends are taking, rather than what they are more interested in. These students may have no idea what the course is about, so it's beneficial to have the teachers create the necessary work. Saying this, with the expectations held by teachers, it's only fair for students to be prepared. Assigning this type of work, will help take a leading hand in the successes waiting for these curios students. 
691	With the idea of no school, beaches, and long nights, students won't be focusing on work. Students then tend to lack academically because their brain hasn't been tested for quite some time. Brain activity never stops, even when sleeping, but it does forget how to preform in certain circumstances. Luckily, teachers understand that this happens because even teachers go through this mindset. They don't give these assignment because they feel like it, but because they know who teenagers are. If students begin to expect no work during breaks, this will continue to occur 
692	Teacher-designed summer assignments will continue to test the ability within each student, while keeping their brains on track 
693	In comparison, students will be given the same amount of work when assigned these projects. No one student will have to do more than the other, unless given a choice 
694	Student-designed projects may bring conflict to some who feel that they're doing more than another. This will only cause more stress on teachers and students who rather spend their time worrying about their own work. Students who may have had an older sibling in the same class tell them what to expect and then them receiving something completely different angers students. Students stick to the idea that everyone should get what others get, nothing different. If they receive something opposing their original belief, they will bring it to the teacher's attention almost immediately. The importance of teacher-designed projects is to inform the student not cause arguments. In addition, it will also limit the amount of work teachers have to put in. Teachers can then focus on what the main idea of the project is and assess each student based off of that. 
695	Summer assignments should not be seen as a waste of time, but something that helps the individual continue to educate, prepare, and reflect on their own learning. As a teenager in high school, the addition resources assigned are drastically helpful. They limit worry, stress, and over all forgetfulness. This is all given when the project is teacher-designed because it ensures that what is being done is beneficial for the upcoming year. Teachers keep in mind that it's not what one does with the work provided but what they make of it. The projects teachers create, test the capabilities of the individual and their ability to apply this knowledge. All in which is important for a successful student. 
696	As students grow older, they will be assigned an appropriate amount of responsibilities, such as schoolwork and projects; even some that are meant to be completed by the first day of school. Summer project can be intimidating to some students, however, summer projects are only meant to benefit the students. The benefits of summer projects include: the continuation of study and time management skills, as well as reading and writing. There is a simple solution that could be put in effect by the school officials and administration; allowing students to design their own projects based off a topic that peaks their interest. Allowing students to design their own projects will significantly increase the interest level and positive feedback that will be the deciding factor in whether or not the project is assigned the next year. The interest level and feedback received will be based off of the following: if students are given the opportunity to conduct research that they find intriguing, not what their teacher finds intriguing; their final project will be significantly better than if the project was teacher-designed. 
697	Discovering passions may be difficult at a young age, however, if students are given the opportunity to focus on a topic that they find passion in, it will create a well-done project. 
698	Passions could include: athletics, academics, or an extra curricular; such as music, band, or the arts. A student-designed project will let students study a topic that they are interested in. If students are interested in what they are studying or researching, then there is a increased chance of students truly enjoying the project. As mentioned about, a student-designed project will allow for a quality project. The more say students have regarding their schoolwork, the better the outcome of that work. Personally, when given the chance to chose the topic or project guideline, there is a much better result than when given a strict outline. Typically, summer projects appear to be a burden for some students, however, students will not see a project about their passions as a concern. 
699	Study skills, such as spacing out workdays and time management, are skills that students will continue to use as they further their education. Scheduling workdays is a simple way to reduce stress, and a way for students to not feel overwhelmed. Time management goes along with spacing out workdays because it will prevent students from cramming in the project the night before it is due. If students leave the project until the last minute, the result will not be pleasing and it would be a waste of an opportunity for students to find one of their true passions. Students will also be given the opportunity to learn the proper way to research their topic. This is yet another skill that students will use as they continue their education. Learning how to start researching and then learning what can be cut out is a challenging process that students can learn through the process of trial and error. Students will be able to take the research from various reliable resources, and develop their project, while learning an additional skill: project design. Designing a project so it is appealing to most and finding what is most convenient for you is important because it will allow future projects to be completed in an effective and efficient manner. 
700	allow students to get to know each other, work on public speaking and presentation skills, and will show students topics of interest. 
701	Projects that are controlled by the student will allow icebreaker activities to run smoothly. Icebreaker activities are typically included in the first day of school, and they allow students to get to know each other and their teacher. If every student came prepared to share their presentation, they they would not only learn something about their fellow classmates, but they would also get the chance to work on their public speaking and presentation skills. Public speaking may be one of the most relevant and commonly used skills as you enter higher education and the workforce, as it is something that is hard to avoid. The more it is practiced, the more comfortable people, in this case, student will get with it. Students can also use this project as a starting to point to see where they might what to take their future. Deciding classes for the next school year, or even thinking about a college major can be difficult and intimidating. However, if students know their passions and interests, then the process will seem significantly less worrisome. A way to reduce the stress on making decision such as classes or college, is to let students discover their interests through student-designed projects. 
702	If summer projects are fully designed by students, then students will be able to focus on their passions, improve their study skills, and share a topic that they find interesting. Revealing the topics that students find passion in will lead to a quality projects, a head start in determining courses and majors, and will serve as a way to learn necessary skills for college and the workforce. The more opportunities students are given to decide what they want to study or complete a project about will allow students to find those passions, such as sports, a specific class, or a certain type of art or drama. Student-designed project will also let students learn the skills that are most useful for them, for instance: time management or public speaking. Most importantly, students will be able to discover who they truly are through a project that they design.  
703	People say not everyone can do what some people can do. A person can be good at something while someone else is terrible at it. 
704	I disagree with this decision because you go to school to learn about what you need to know for the future. You don't go to school to learn about sports, or learn how to make yearbooks. You don't go to school to get pushed by someone about something you don't want to do. You should be able to have your own choice. 
705	You should especially join if you like to see ancient artifacts such as an old castle is Crete and even the Panama Canal. 
706	All in all, this new technology is very valuable in a classroom. It would durrastically change how kids learn and would make them way more interested than they currently are. Most kids do not learn the same, this technology could change that so each student can learn the way that best helps them. This application will help out teachers tremendously and could really improve passing rates! 
707	One simple, yet extremly effective way to reduce pollution is limiting the transportation methods we travel by. 
708	Limiting car and vehicle usage can reduce pollution, 
709	nearly eliminate accidents, and makes the road a safer place. 
710	"The usage of vehicles are a double-edged sword. They may get us to where we need to go with plenty of time to spare, but what are we really loosing because of it? What we are loosing is the environment and also our health. In Paris, the pollution rate almost reached a new record high, thus forcing the partial driving pan to clear the air of the global city. In the article, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", its evident that cars hurt us in more ways then we realize. Buisnesses are suffering due to the lack of transportaion avaliable to delivery their services as seen in source number two, ""Delivery companies complained of lost revenue"". ""Congestion was down 60% in the capital of france after five-days of intesifying smog..."" The smog was so dense that Paris officials created a law making even-numbered license plates to leave there cars at home to reduce pollution. "
711	Despite the benefits that come along with transportation, there are more disadvanges then advantages. Pollution is the second largest source of America's emissions just behind power plants. Many sociologist have seen these statistics and have also noticed that American transportation usuage has slowly been declining since its peak in 2005. People are slowly but surely helping the cause in their own ways, whether its by delaying getting there license, limit there driving, or even car-pooling with friends. Limiting car and vehicle usage can reduce pollution, nearly eliminate accidents, and makes the road a safer place to be. 
712	Most people you know probably participate in some form of an extracurricular activity. Whether it be sports, a school club, theatre, or something else, almost all of us have participated in an extracurricular at some point in our lives. Extracurricular activities have many benefits, such as an opportunity to do something you enjoy, which will make you happier and help you relieve stress, and an opportunity to meet new people who share your interests. However, some people may argue that extracurricular activities take away time that they don't have, but there's a solution for that. 
713	I agree with the principle's decision to have everyone participate in an extracurricular activity because there are many benefits that come from participating in them. 
714	Extracurricular activities are a great way to do something you enjoy. 
715	There are many different things to do which means that there is something for everyone. Having the opportunity to be participating in something you enjoy will make you happier. It has been proven that when you're happier, you have lower stress levels. When asked, 9 out of 10 students said that they felt stressed by school often. An extracurricular activity is a great way to relieve some of that stress. By participating in something you enjoy and something you chose to do, you'll be able to improve your skills, which can give you a sense of accomplishment and happiness. These are just some of the benefits of an extracurricular activity. 
716	Extracurricular activities are also a great way to meet new people. 
717	There are people that come from all different backgrounds, that you may not have classes with at school, that may be in different grades, or that you may have never known without participating in an extracurricular activity. These new people will share the same interests as you which is a great way to be able to do things together and it gives you an opportunity to be able to learn from each other. By being in an extracurricular activity where you get to meet these new people, you'll have an opportunity to hang out with them on a regular basis when you may not have been able to do that any other time. These are just some of the other many benefits that an extracurricular activity can bring. 
718	There are some people who may argue against everyone having to participate in an extracurricular activity. They may say that they don't have the time to participate and if they do then they won't get their school work done. 
719	However, other people who participate in extracurricular activities get their work done on time which means that there are ways to do so. 
720	You also won't have that activity every single day which means that it won't inflict on your everyday life. If you're worried about not having time to get work done, you can focus really hard during your study hall period to get more work done, you can get up earlier in the mornings to get extra work done, and you can even do work on your way to or from the activity, or to and from school in the mornings and afternoons. 
721	You may also argue that there are no extracurricular activities that are offered that you want to participate in. 
722	However, there is such a wide variety of things to do at most schools that there is something everyone can enjoy. 
723	However if there isn't something you would want to participate in, most schools will help you create a new club that you can recruit people for and run with a teachers help. Even if people want to argue against this new rule, there are solutions to their complaints 
724	Overall, there are many benefits to participating in extracurricular activities. You get to do something you enjoy, you get to meet new people, you'll be happier, and although people may find ways to argue against the new requirements, the good outweighs the bad. There are plenty of options at most schools so that everyone can find something that they enjoy. There are plenty of different sports, there are debate clubs, the student council, yearbook committee, the school newspaper, theatre, and clubs for almost any interest someone may have. In conclusion, I agree fully with the principal's new decision and I believe that everyone should participate in some type of extracurricular as well. 
725	To maintain a healthy, active mind, many students are assigned an educational, summer-long project.  These assignments vary from science experiments to maintaining a reading log; anything that would keep kids busy on their summer-long vacation.  However, there is the question of if these summer assignments should be created by teachers or by the students themselves. 
726	To create the optimal educational experience, summer projects should be self-administered 
727	Providing students with the opportunity to take control of their own summer project makes the assignment more individualized. 
728	Compare the idea of assigning a summer project to the scenario of a student choosing their classes; they are much more likely be perform well in a subject of their interest than in a random class enforced upon them.  Relating this back to summer projects, students tend to better commit to a project that aligns with their interests.  Also, Students are more motivated when they have control over their decisions.  When people take a personal initiative towards what they do, they carry more pride and are more successful in their work.  Personalization of summer projects produce more meaningful experiences that serve as a solid foundation for education. 
729	As students are away from school for a long three months, there is no other person better than the students themselves to manage a personal project.  Teacher are not aware of the responsibilities or vacation plans of their students, so the expectations they would set might not be attainable for some students.  For example, a student would not be able to keep up with an at-home project if they were away for the majority of their summer.  Rather if they were to choose their own project, they could more easily manage how to carry out the project in consideration of their personal circumstance.  In general, students would be better at following their own judgment when creating and completing their own project.  Without any teachers to answer their questions over the summer, it is better for the students to be their own bosses.  
730	If students were to create their own parameters for a summer-long project, it would be easier to manage because the students would be more knowledgeable of the requirements than if the project were assigned by a teacher. 
731	Leaving a student to create and complete their own summer-long project would instill responsibility.  At an age of maturation, students need to learn how to be self-sufficient.  
732	The responsibility of a summer-long project is comparable to that which is handled in the regular education students go through the other three seasons of the year.  Students must learn to make decisions for themselves in school as they would have to for a summer project.  A self-assigned project teaches many of the qualities innate to being an functioning adult.  Many people must work by their own deadlines to make a living.  Without responsiblity, which is taught be self-assigned summer projects, people would not be able to hold jobs to pay bills.  The long vacation over summer is a oppertune time to hone personal skills necessary to getting by and thriving in life. 
733	Through a self-created project, students can best investigate their personal intersets by setting and managing their own goals while developing responsibility along the way.  When students can take it upon themselves to improve their education while on their summer break, they can find success and personal enrichment while still enjoying their vacation                                         
734	with the project being student designed it would be more creative for students. 
735	with the project being student designed it would be a lot of different ideas students can choose from 
736	Students will have a wide variety of options to choose from 
737	Freedom to expresss themselves 
738	their resources will be known. 
739	Back then when I was in 4th grade almost every other weekend my aunt would take my cousin,brother and I to this frozen yougurt place in Generic_City. The place was called frozen frog or something like that and we would just try all of the flavors when we got a chance it was amazing but we only could fill up the cup plus the toppings that we wanted,so we went ahead and made our choices and we said we would try something new the next time we went to that shop. Just like students we had the choice to do what we wanted to pick and get it done without someone else telling me to do what they wanted us to do. 
740	When I first started playing Mortal Kombat 11. I was so excited to try out all the new and old characters and see what new things they can do. I told myself I want to try and use different characters than the ones I use constantly. So I do so and realize that I never really play with Generic_Name or Generic_Name for some reason but then when I tried using them in a real fight it never really worked out. So I had convinced myself that it was all because I never learned their moves but then something hit me it wasn't that i haven't mastered their moves in such a small amont of time it was because their moves were just the same as Mortal Kombat X and I am not really good at working with close ranged fighters. My specialty was at fighting with those who can attack at any distance. Zoners were my best bet at winning any match. Also like students allowing people to see their limits can help others know what they are good at and what they aren't and they won't feel troubled because of a few minor things that were out of their control stop them from doing their job. 
741	Truthfully it is just another way to tell someone no to doing this or that or it is a continuation of limiting people on their creativity. Back in 6th grade most people had a problem with the art tecaher because she had such strict rules in a way it was either her way or the highway. No one could really understand why she had us doing things this way or that way. With that being said everyone was hoping that one day she would actually miss a day and one day she called out but then I looked around me everyone was having a fun time because they could express themselves through their art. All students need to be able to express themselves without having someone telling them that they are doing things wrong. 
742	some people might say that is not true and if we allow students to do whatever they feel like doing then how are we suppose to make them do anything educational and how do you think it is going to help them in life. 
743	Allow studnets to have freedom in their life without having to be forced to do things,Students will have a wide variety of options and their limits are know through their experiences.    
744	In 1973, the first handheld cell phone was made. 23 years later, the first ever flip phone was introduced to the public. Cell phones have come a long way since they were first invented, and today people rely on them for more than just communication. Smartphones. For instance, can do anything you can imagine, and we rely on them so much there's no telling where we would be without them. In fact, people use their cell phones practically 24/7. People text on the toilet, stream music in the shower, and unfortunately, use their phones while driving. This is probably the worst thing about cell phones. Phone related car crashes are one of the most common causes of fatalities in teens and adults. 1.6 million crashes a year are the result of people using their phones while driving. 
745	No one, not even the most skilled driver in the world should be able to use a cell phone in any way while driving.  
746	It's not always easy to control a vehicle. Weather conditions, traffic, and other people make driving very difficult sometimes. If you add the distraction of a cell phone, driving is 10 times more difficult to focus on. 
747	You've probably seen someone text and drive. In the few seconds they take to glance away from the road and at their phones, a car crash could happen. It only takes one second for your car to swerve into the other lane. Phones should never be used while driving for many reasons, and the main reason being that it is extremely dangerous. Texting and driving makes you 23% more likely to get in an accident. It's so much smarter to wait until you've reached your destination to use your phone. If you can't wait, you can pull over on the side of the road. If not, you could greatly risk your life. 
748	Another important reason why operating a phone while driving should be prohibited involves other drivers as well as passengers that may ride in your car. 
749	Lastly, in some states, using your phone while driving is illegal and can cost you a lot of money 
750	In georgia, for instance, holding a cellphone while not parked, or even pressing one button on a phone can get you a ticket. With each offense, the fines get larger. It's not worth paying a large ticket to send a short text message. Additionally, if someone dies in a car crash because of your actions, such as texting and driving, you could be charged with vehicular manslaughter and go to jail for up to 20 years. Texting and driving tickets, if shown on a police report for a wreck you are responsible for, will greatly increase your insurance rates, making your life a lot harder than it was before you decided to text and drive. Unless you have a money tree in your backyard and don't mind ridiculous insurance for the rest of your life, its best to wait until you get home to use your phone. 
751	In conclusion, it's hard to imagine why anyone would think using a phone while driving is a good idea. Nothing good can come from texting or talking on the phone behind the wheel. The best decision anyone can make is to completely forget about their phones while driving and focus on the road. You risk so many things by using your phone while operating a vehicle.. You risk your life, your friends life, strangers lives, and even the money in your pocket. The only exception to being on a phone while driving should be to report an emergency. Otherwise, the use of a cell phone is risky and should be completely banned all over the world. Statistics alone should be enough to open people's eyes to the dangers of using their phone in the car. Phones are distracting and without a doubt should not be used while operating a vehicle. 
752	hen we get home we don't do anything and kids are lazy nowadays. We either take a nap, eat, watch YouTube, or play video games. 
753	If your not interested in sports you could do other afters school activities like  Book club  Yearbook club  Dance club  Cooking club  Computer club  Student council  Engineering club  You could do those clubs in stead of playing sports 
754	"The implications of technology that can detect emotions simply by reading the muscles in the face sound truly remarkable. The thought that one can tell what another is thinking simply by plugging data or maybe even a picture into an algorithm sounds like fiction, but may soon be a reality. The article, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto briefly discusses the possible use of such technology in a classroom. The system could examine student's faces, and if they read to be unengaged or uninterested, could adjust the lesson to make learning more interesting to that group of students. That type of technology could revolutionize learning, and customly tailor lesson plans to the feelings of students on any given day. "
755	The technology to read emotions would greatly change the way students learn. If a teacher used this technology and noticed that all of his students were bored and uninterested, he could alter the lesson plan to make it more fun 
756	Not all students will feel the same, though, which is also where this technology could come in. At the beginning of a school year, perhaps, the teacher could use the technology on the class to see how they feel about the particular subject. Then, the students who are excited about the subject and show interest could be sorted into a class that can be run in a way that makes the class educationally suitable for students who actually want to learn that subject. The students that do not show as much interest, or none at all, could be sorted into a seperate class that makes the subject more fun, but still teaches the same points as the other class. 
757	Another application of such technology in the classroom could help to make learning overall more fun for all students 
758	If many students start to become bored, then the teacher could come up with a quick game to enrich the learning experience. If many of the students are already interested with the subject matter, the teacher may not have to do as much adjusting. If the students need to be enriched with games and activities, now the teacher will immeditely know. This could overall make learning a lot more fun, but introducing more games and activities into the curriculum as see fit. If the students want to play knowledge enriching games, they can just show disinterest, and the system would pick that up and inform the teacher. The technology to read student's emotions in the classroom as a very basic level could make learning more fun and personal to the student. 
759	Reading students emotions would also be helpful to identify those students who are struggling to focus or simply understand the material being presented to them in class 
760	If a student shows confusion or discontent, it may be able to pick that up and show the teacher specific students that need help. The teacher could take the student aside and ask if they need help, and then adjust their learning accordingly. Another way this technology could help struggling students is to set them up with tutors that are doing well in the class. If a student is excited to learn consistantly during that class period, they could be sat next to a struggling student in order for the one not doing as well to recieve help from a peer. The ability to read emotions in the classroom would help students who are struggling tremendously. 
761	Adjusting lesson plans, making learning more fun, and helping struggling students are three of the main reasons in which emotion-reading teachnology would be amazing to introduce into the classroom. The students would control the class, not the teacher, and it would make the learning experience more customized to each particular class. As well, it would allow for more interesting games and activities to be introduced into the curriculum in order to keep learning entertaining and entriching. Students who struggle with particular subjects would be able to recieve help using the technology, and the teacher would not have to guess which students are struggling only based on grades. The technology of emotion-reading should be applied to all classrooms when it becomes widely available, because it could help both teachers and students improve the learning environment. 
762	"On paragraph twelve, Garvin say that,"" It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,that's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars. "
763	Around the world, people are going around side by side, without depending on cars like they use to back a couple years ago. Improvements shown in places like Paris, shows how the limiting of automobile usage can greatly impact the envrionment to create a clean atmosphere. Not only would it help clear smog, but it would allow a stress free city from being populated by traffic jams and yelling individuals, who are experiencing road rage thanks to the taffic. A happier environment would be created when people are out rding bikes to places and walking with friends. In cocnclusion, the benifits of limiting car usage are as clear as water, it would reduce smog, promote other forms of transprtation, and would help our culture by creating a happier, cleaner atmosphere to live in.    
764	Venus is a challenge to get to with its hot surface, with its thick atmosphere, and atmospheric pressure. But scientists and astronomers are facinated by Venus, because they believe it had oceans and could have supported various forms of life. 
765	While it is important for a young adolescent to become involved in some form of an extracurricular, to make something of the such mandatory is unneeded and inconvenient for many. 
766	Taking part in a extra activities requires many resources which some people can't afford or simply don't have. 
767	For those who are on the free or reduced lunch plan, it's even more likely that they wont be able to place their child into an extracurricular due to costs. Activities such as sports, dance, theater, and clubs cost money, something many don't have much of. Whether it's to simply enroll your child in the sport, to pay for dance shoes, or to buy supplies it always comes down to some sort of price. Even if a family is not struggling with funding, many see it as unnecessary to spend money on something their child truly doesn't wish to participate in. 
768	When students are forced to spend their free time at a practice or rehearsal, this creates conflict within the household dynamic. 
769	Without the children there to watch after their younger siblings or to perform everyday chores such as cleaning up after the house or tending to a farm if the student were to live in the more rural areas, it causes the family to have to search for daycare or hire an extra hand which is not only costly but also stressful. 
770	Many parents or legal guardians travel and work for several hours, often getting home late. If children are at extracurricular while their parents work, this means there is no one who is available to pick them up or provide transportation to such activity or back home. While carpooling or busing may be an option in specific areas, this does not apply to students who do not have access to said buses or who live in extremely rural areas, further from the school or activity site. 
771	The decision to devote ones time, money, and effort to such a consuming thing should be a personal and willing choice. 
772	Becoming apart of an extracurricular activity should be a free willing, and personal choice that fits for both students and their families. This should revolve around the students wishes and not those of someone who does not know each child's personal situation. Forcing one into something they did not choose for themselves has very few positive effects and is bound to do more harm than good for each individual and their families. Enlisting each and every child into activities outside of school causes too many conflicts with time, money, transportation, and a student's overall well being. Although it's encouraged to participate in an extracurricular, it should not be made mandatory for students. 
773	students should be able to design their own projects. Its not only their summer but their time with family. It could help bonding with not only family but with some new friends, and it could make summer a lot more fun. And also improve creativity as all students want to let their minds free when making a project. They want to see how much they could get out of something so making students design their projects is the best way to go. Let their mind flow and enjoy not only their project but summer as well.  
774	Through the school year students are required complete many learning based projects that are designed and instructed by teachers, but as the school year ends many teachers fear that students may lose the knowledge gained over the year during summer break. To prevent this from happening many schools require summer projects that reinforce knowledge learned during the school year 
775	Many people argue if a teacher or student designed projects are more effective to help retain knowledge, but student designed projects are believed to be more effective. 
776	When a summer project is designed by a student it gives students a chance not only learn while completing the project, but to learn while making it 
777	During summer many students have the desire to quickly complete the assignment a teacher has assigned, by doing the bare minimum, but if the project was designed by the student themselves it would give them the opportunity to learn while both making and completing the project. When you develop a project, a lot of research is need to be conducted, this gives students an opportunity to absorb more information, then if they were just completing a project. 
778	Designing a project also gives students knowledge in the topic their project is on, as well as skills on how to make projects and other important research based skills that are not focused on in school, but are necessary in higher level education.  
779	Not only do student designed projects give students an extra opportunity to learn, but it also provides students with a sense of real world experiences that enhance learning, and general skills. 
780	After high school graduation many colleges and universities require that students conduct research projects designed by themselves, in order to receive a degree. This may be very difficult for students coming from an environment were teachers design everything, but a student developed projects in school would give kids an experiences in this situation helping them latter in life, and making college projects easier to complete. Also, in many work environments employees are left on their own to complete tasks and projects, and an experience in designing your own project during school years would help people develop necessary skills for an post- graduation career, as well as high school or college jobs. This experience would also gives students something to put under leadership on a college application.  
781	Another essential impact of allowing students to design their own projects during summer, is that this allows students to develop a senses of freedom that is locked up during the long school year 
782	Throughout the school year teachers provide projects that are essential for learning the content, but prevents students form using there creativity and expanding on their freedom to think in different ways. During the summer if students were allowed to develop their own projects they would feel more free, this would allow them to experiment with different ideas and concepts, this also would allow them to figure out which way they learn best. While being away from an instructor such as a teacher, kids could use their own ideas to create a project, that is not influenced by others, and this would show schools and teacher how much a student truly understands not just the knowledge that a teacher is forcing upon them. A sense of freedom is also important for preparing students for their next step in life, whether it is a higher education level, or a career, because, it is important students get an experience learning by themselves. 
783	Many people may argue that teacher designed projects are the most educational and effective way to help students retain their knowledge, because they are made by experts in the subject, and are designed by adults, or that allowing students to develop their own projects is a waste of time, 
784	Life for many people in Vauban is great because its the relief of no polution, the crashes and killings of pedestrians decreased greatly and just all in all less money wasted on gas.  
785	This being said cars help greatly reduce the gas fumes in greenhouses when they are banned and not being used 
786	This banned vehicles and helped reduce smog. 
787	Schools are places where kids end up spending the majority of their childhood in. Most kids end up disliking school for one reason or another, while others might love school. To have the ability to know how a child is feeling and map their patters can become useful in more ways than one. 
788	The use of reading a students emotions is valuable in many ways 
789	helping with possible depression 
790	enhancing the material 
791	creating a better enviroment. 
792	"School can be a stressful time for many students and also a time of growth. Especially in high school and even middle school, the childs body is going through puberty. This chemical change in the body can lead to mood swings and other issues especially when school stress is added on top. This technology is capable of indicating ""...the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one""(paragraph 7). "
793	With the aid of this technology the school can help students before they develope mental illnesses like depression that often go unseen due to hiding true emotion. 
794	"Also, in many schools students usually find the learning material to be sub par or boring in many cases. However with the aid of this technology ""a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" (paragraph 6). If a teacher was able to pin point when exactly a lesson becomes boring it would majorly help with being able to reconstruct it as well "
795	For difficult classes being able to know when the students are lost would help significantly in increasing the understanding of the material as teachers will be able to know exactly what the students dont understand, and thus be able to help them achieve better grades.  
796	Being able to understand students emotions in a learning enviroment can also help with improving the school overall. 
797	"SInce the technology would be able to understand the basic emotions like ""...happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness"" (paragraph 3), this can give a school tons of feedback on how to improve. For example, with negative emotions, a school would be able to improve its cafeteria food quality from knowing what foods are highly unpopular, and as a result save food from wasting. Or during school events, even though the event might be a success knowing how each of the students felt about the event would help with improving it for next year. The addition of this technology would allow a school to be the best the possibly could.  "
798	The addition of this facial technology can be quite revolutionary in a school setting. As students often dont share their true feelings, issues can be confronted and the students mentality can be improved. Also a better, and positive learning enviroment can be created. The ability to remove student confusion and make learning interesting would go a long way in helping not only the students grow and move forward positivly, but also the school as a whole. 
799	Attending after school clubs and activities can give you a place where people with similar interests and hobbies all come together. 
800	After school clubs can be a safe space where you and your friends get together to do something you all enjoy, and you could make new friends along the way. Being in a club can provide a safe space, and the people there often share your interests. 
801	Activities like these can make you an all rounded person while also giving you a break from school.  
802	Activities from football to Rubiks cube club can create a safe space for the people on the team or in the club. 
803	"What do I mean by ""safe space?""  A safe space is where people can share how they feel, and why they feel that way. An example could be if you're on a football team your teammates become your friends and that gives you a whole community of people who care about you. It doesn't even have to be a team it could even be a group that likes horses, but they still have something in common to bond over. Teammates also tend to build you up, and give a boost in confidence which can help you be a stronger person. Did you know that having fun with your friends and participating in the activities you enjoy can even help you get into college? "
804	I think that having students participate in an extracurricular activities could very beneficial for many different aspects of their development, such as social, emotional, and in some cases even physical. 
805	Students have a lot on their plates between school, homework, and studying, sometimes it's good to take a break 
806	What better way to relax then do something you enjoy with other people that enjoy it as well. Playing a sport after school can help you create close friends and teammates. When you think about stress reliving one of things you might think of is one of your favorite things to do with some of your friends. Well guess what, you just explained what a club is. In that portion of your day you don't have to worry about acing that test all you have to think about is swishing that three or winning that chess match.  
807	That's why I think that having everyone participate in a club or sport could be very beneficial for these reasons, and I think it's a great addition to our school systems.   
808	Ding, ding, ding. Thats the sound of a school bell at the end of the day. Over 500 kids rushing to their bus, but not one of them is staying after school. It's not that schools don't have after school it's that students just don't care or they don't know what's out there. In all my years of going to school I have all ways participated in after school activities, and every single one of them has helped me in some way, and that's why I think that students should participate in them 
809	Students should be required to participate in sports, working on year book, or serving on student council 
810	Students that play sports have to maintain their grades when they'er off the field in order to play on the field. 
811	"This helps them to have a ""C"" or higher and they can apply what they learn on the field to when they'er off the field. A student in my class is always asking for his absent work because he has to leave early for one of his games. This student doesn't play just one sport but 3. So when he comes back the next day he has to make up all of his work if he wants to stay on the team. An example of applying what student learn on the field to off the field is my friend that plays football. He said to me ""I could never make a touch down if some one wasn't covering my blind side"",then he said, ""It's not about if  I win because  I would have never maid it if there was no one on the team to cover me."" Then the next day at his game he maid sure that the crowds were celebrating him and the team when they won. "
812	Year book gives students a chance to interact with other students by giving new students a chance to make friends, and it helps them find other students they can relate to. 
813	In the 6th grade I was going to a new school, that I new nothing about and then club sign ups came, and I decided to sign up for year book. when I started out they gave me a camera and told me what kind of pictures they were looking for. When I went around the school and asked students if I could take their picture they were nice about it and said sure. Out of the 25 people I asked to take their picture 17 of them asked me if I wanted to be friends, and I said yes. Also the people in the year book club were new to the school just like me we talked about how we came to a new school and none of are friends came with us. Year book helped me find friends and find people who understood what I was going trough.  
814	Student council is a good way to give back to your school, by showing that they appreciate your school and to show school spirit 
815	Students on student council show that they appreciate their school when they represent them. For example when student council does a sock drive and then goes and distributes the socks to the less fortunate, they are showing how their school feels, and that they want to give back to the community we live in. When the students on student council show school spirit they go to the school sports games, show up for fund raisers, and set an example for how other students should act in school. By showing this appreciation and spirit they set the bar higher for other schools and show that they support our's. 
816	Students should participate in sports, working on year book, or serving on student council because they will have good grades, a chance to interact with other students, and a way to give back to the community. Students will build character buy interacting with other students and have fun while doing it. Ding, ding, ding, thats the sound of the bell for after school. All the students flood into the hallways talking to each other about sports, year book, and student council. No student fells left out and every student has a friend. 
817	Life is a marathon not a sprint; therefore, people can not take breaks from educating themselves, even in the summer. However, long, boring, and useless summer project persuade students to avoid the project; forcing life's marathon to become a sprint. 
818	Summer projects need a change and can be by students, 
819	students know how long to make it, 
820	how to make it interesting, 
821	what it must include. 
822	Summer gives students a break from the long and hard work of the strenuous school year, therefore the stack of an eight page summer packet that may not be difficult, is enough to intimidate a student to cheat on it or simply not finish it. Student-summer-packet-designers understand the struggle and can make it a length at persuades the students to complete it on their own. 
823	Others might suggest that having fewer questions and less pages will just decrease a student's time spent learning or reviewing material. 
824	Summer is meant for students to take a break from the boring and uninteresting work of the school year, therefore, the dull material in a summer packet only validates their choice to start and finish the packet a day before the start of the new school year, if at all. If student-summer-packet-designers take control over the content of these packets other students will find the information more alluring. 
825	Some can argue that teachers can pick just as fascinating topics as students. 
826	However, because of age gaps and other variables many teacher do not know what students find entertaining. 
827	Many items in the packet also lack the ability to teach valuable information that can lead to the success in the course. Student-summer-packet-designers can use their knowledge from taking the course to make a packet filled with example that they would have benefited from and with problems they struggled with; allowing the new students to be better prepared. 
828	People might suggest that teachers know the material the best so they will form the best summer packet. 
829	However, students know what they struggled with more than the teachers; therefore, they know what to put in the packet to avoid struggle for future students. 
830	"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author provides a compelling and efficient argument to support the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. Using statistics, factual information, and specific plans being developed as we speak, the author convinces the audience that exploring Venus is worth the risks involved. "
831	The author throroughly describes the immersive learning possibilities that could be discovered by studying the foreign planet, the surviveable and safe travel conditions for humans, and other exploration options to ensure a safe and efficient venture to Venus. 
832	First of all, the author immediately combats the argument of Venus being too dangerous to venture. 
833	When discussing the exploration of Venus, most people are turned off by its reputation as a dangerous and challenging planet for humans to study. While the author doesn't stray away from these harsh extremities, they make sure to prove how these details seem insignificant and how safe travel can still be executed. The author thoroughly describes the plan provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to allow astronauts to float above the fray and avoid the hazardous conditions. They provide specific qualities of the plan, such as the air pressure being close to the sea level on Earth, the abundance of solar power, and the containment of radiation, to prove how humans would be kept in a safe atmosphere. They even provide a real world connection between NASA's possible solution and a blimp-like vheicle hovering around the ground to make it easier for the audience to understand. The author combats the speculaiton of Venus being too dangerous to explore in order to further support the idea of it being a worthy pursuit. 
834	Furthermore, the author heavily emphasizes the learning opportunities that exploring the foreign planet would undoubtedly provide us. 
835	"While providing simple, yet interesting facts about Venus, such as it being the planet closest to Earth's density and size, may be enough to intrigue the audience into wanting to learn more about the planet, the author takes it a step further. The author goes in depth about the possibility of Venus being the most Earth-like planet in our solar system long ago. They detail the planet's environment today, consisting of Earth-like structures such as rocky sediment surfaces, valleys, mountans, craters, and other geological findings. They also state ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" This information opens up an entirely new realm of possibilites for the audience to consider, and is more likely to interest them as it directly relates to our life on Earth. The way the author has set up the comparisons of Earth and Venus have allowed the audience to view the exploration of the planet as an opportunity to see a planet that could be like us; a planet with living, breathing forms of life similar to what we see everyday. The author uses this information to encourage the audience to view the pursuit of Venus as a chance to gain information on the things we see in our everyday life, and not just complex ideas that are difficult to understand and most-likely won't affect them. "
836	Finally, the author provides numerous options being developed for humans to embark in safe and efficient travel to Venus. 
837	"When discussing the potential plans to explore the planet, the author states ""Many researches are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus."" This quote makes it clear to the audience that scientists are doing whatever it takes to develop multiple, efficient plans for space travel. The author also goes onto provide different examples to further convey how close scientists are to developing the safest plan possible. They specifically mention the use of simplified electronics made of silicon carbide and explain how they've already been tested in a chamber that simulate the conditions of Venus's surfaces, yet how they're still being improved upon. They also describe an old technology called mechanical computer, noting how this technology has already been used frequently in the 1940's and how it can be incorporated into space travel now. The author has given detailed descriptions of the efforts made and the options available to provide a safe embarkment for humans to support the ideas that Venus is a worthy pursit. "
838	"Clearly, the author has efficiently and convincingly supported the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. By describing all the information about the existence of other life forms and the similarities to Earth that we could potentially learn from the study, the author proves how worthy Venus is to be discovered. The author also rebuttals one of the main concerns for traveling to the planet by explaining how plans are being developed to make travel and living conditions surviveable, safe, and efficient for both humans and machines. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author was able to convey and support the idea that Venus is worthy of exploration. "
839	I disagree with this because i think that students can do what they feel like doing and not be forced into something. 
840	"""SCORE! Three points to the Wildcats,"" an announcer exclaims. The crowd goes absolutely wild, and the players feel proud about their effort. Basketball is only one of the many amazing and exciting extracurricular activities students have the privilege to pick from. There's a variety to what's available, from art to softball to helping produce the school yearbook. Each of those activities are creative, entertaining, and helpful one way or another. In addition, our principal has decided that all students should take part in at least one extracurricular activity. As a result, some students are complaining and disapproving about this decision while others, such as me, think this is an opportunity for students to have a incredible time doing whatever activity they choose. "
841	because it gives students a chance to socialize with new people, 
842	learn new skills and experience new things, 
843	entertain themselves while impacting the school as well as the community. 
844	To elaborate, drama, or theater, involves everyone to communicate with each other to create a scene that will dazzle the audience. They must decide how to react, talk, and act to one another to make the performance truly spectacular.  Additionally, students don't just see their classmates when they go to their chosen activity, there are other kids from other grades there as well, so it's the perfect chance to meet unfamiliar people, and chat with familiar people, too. To add to that, the activity likely brings out skills in others that you didn't know they had, and that enables students to connect with one another and find out more about each other. 
845	Most activity leaders allow field trips at least once a year. As an effect, students get to go places they've never been before, and if they have, they get to share their experience at that place with different people. Also, multiple activities, such as art, teach students to make certain things. In artistic cases, you get to learn about pottery, clay, watercolor and acrylic painting, different drawing tools, and more. In addition, music lets you explore your voice, public speaking lets you learn how to be a motivational speaker, marching band lets you play more pieces of music with your instrument, and experience more with it, and so many more activities teach you a variety of different things. 
846	For example, teens in charge of the yearbook have a entertaining time making sure their product is pleasing to the eye, so that our school has something valuable to sell to students, and so that they can look back on all the great memories they had at our precious school. Nevertheless, at the same time they're expressing their creativity into the book. Also, the art students create posters and fliers to advertise upcoming school events so that everyone can enjoy that event with their friends. I know by experience that creating colorful, bright papers is a fun-filled activity to do. Plus, some students who are in the Environment Protection Youths of Virginia group volunteer to pick up litter along the sidewalks, in parks, and many other places that would harm the environment of our beloved state if they weren't cleared and cleaned. They have a wonderful time doing just that while chatting to their friends.  
847	To summarize, because students get to socialize with people they never got the opportunity to talk to before, experience new things and get taught new skills, and impact the community as well as themselves, I believe extracurricular activities should definitely be included at our school. They are a very bright part of anyone's day, something that a kid could look forward to on a boring Monday. Also, they could find out new things they didn't have a clue about. A teen gets to talk to others near their age group who started out just being part of a crowd, but because they met them while playing the part of Juliet, they turned into a best friend. Additionally, we get to help the whole state while having a incredible time. So whether it's the applause of an audience at a play, the encouraging comment of a friend on a picture, or the announcement of a score it took a team effort to achieve, the activity that got someone there made a mark on their heart. 
848	There are many ways to learn new things, through experience, being taught, and a multitude of other ways to obtain new information. School is the perfect place to learn new things from teachers that have extensive experience in their specific area of expertise. It is the teacher's and administration's job to help provide a well-rounded education for their students and part of that is assigning work that the students do not want to do. Summer projects are important so the students continue to use their brain and learn how to retain information. 
849	they know the material, 
850	have experience making lessons and projects, 
851	if it was student designed then the work would be almost non-existent. 
852	In order to become a teacher, one has to go to college and earn a degree along with a teaching license and certification. Years of studying and mastering the material provides them with the tools needed to teach their students the subject. Students go to school in order to learn. If they do not know the material, how do they have any qualifications to design a project that would make sure that they learned everything required by the school district, state, or country? People go to school in order to become teachers because they want to help their students learn and grow. Not only is it the subject the teachers are teaching to them, but life skills and tools they can use in the future. If all the work that the students did was up to them, they would lack important skills like researching and communication that could help them in internships and the work world. 
853	Charts, flip charts, and simulations are all used by most teachers to show information that is important. In the summer, students aren't going to want to do homework regardless but if the project is set up with clear and concise directions, it makes the work seem less daunting otherwise. For example, if a student had planned a project, the project would only make sense to them because they are responsible for planning it out and the steps needed. When that transfers onto paper, other students won't know what is happening in the brain of the student who created it and will be confused. 
854	If students were given the opportunity to create their own summer assignment, it would most likely end up being under 5 questions with minimal work needed to be done in order to complete it. This does not help the students in any way, shape, or form. Teenagers look for the quick and easy results that aren't as available as they think in the real world. The point of high school is to prepare you for college. If the work you do in high school is easy and not challenging there is a greater risk for those students to struggle more in college with the huge increase in course work. There are some students who crave the challenge and look for the ability to better themselves. 
855	If they had the opportunity to create their own project it would be beneficial to them because they are willing to put in the work. 
856	Teachers can't trust that all students are like that though because each kid is different and most likely, when given the chance, the student will take the day to go to the pool rather than sit at home and do their own research about Stem Cell research. 
857	Education, is in the hands of each individual and what they choose to make of it is up to them, but teachers should be there to guide and educate their students into making the right choices with their education. Although at the time, their students might respond to the summer assignment with a groan, it is in their best interest to do the work assigned to them by their teacher. Summer projects should be created by their teachers instead of themselves because teachers know what is important and they know what tools and resources to use in order to learn something new. Students have to realize that teachers want what is best for them and want them to be able to succeed in life. 
858	it makes each student want to be creative, 
859	enthusiastic, 
860	have better learning opportunities.  
861	Critics say that summer projects should be teacher designed because it keeps the student following a stricted guideline. 
862	Although following a specific guild line ensures the student will complete the required task thoroughly, it forbids the act of joy. Students are already in school for ten months of the year following a stricted guideline in how to complete a certain assignment, if schools assign a teacher-designed project over the summer it would feel as if they are coming in the way of students summer break. If this project is teacher-designed it would also show students that schools are more biased towards their opinions. 
863	A student would show creativity by choosing the colors they like or making it into something that shows significance to them. This would give the project more depth and meaning rather than a simple teacher-designed assignment. Creativity is important in a student's life because it helps speak what is on their mind and generate from there. Completing a regular teacher-designed project would restrict the idea of building from your life and experience.  
864	On a usual school assignment students wait till the last minute and stress about what to and how to do it, with being able to design your project there would be less procrastination and more completion. With student-design projects each student has more options in what they can create, making them look forward to completing the task with excitement. Most school assignments don't entertain students while accomplishing them, if schools let students design their summer project they can make it fun. For an example, a group of students can plan on working on this project together and be enthusiastic because their options are open and would also give them the ability to help each other with new ideas. 
865	If students have the ability to design their own project they would be choosing what they have to do the research on. This would increase learning because it would interest an individual student and make them want to gain more knowledge about a specific topic. Another way learning opportunities are increased because after the completion of this project, teachers could asses the student on proving that they actually learned over the break. This would also benefit the teacher in learning something new. 
866	summer projects should be student-designed because it promotes creativity, makes it enthusiastic, and increases knowledge. Completing a creative, enthusiastic, and knowledgeable project over the summer sounds far more entertaining than a teacher-designed project. With creativity you can make the project interesting, with enthusiasm you can make the project fun, and with knowledge you can never have enough. Students would have an entertaining and educating summer all in one.          
867	"The author of this work is in favor of taking on the great challenge of landing a ""rover"" on Venus for research and exploration. Venus has many extreme conditions that the earth does not have to endure. "
868	"The author presented many ""solutions"" to these problems. Although plausible, the creations would be impractical and would not produce ensured results. The author's support for the idea of exploring Venus is mediocre at best. "
869	Being the second-closest planet to the sun provides for some nearly impossible conditions for human exploration. 
870	"With Sulfuric Acid in Venus' atmosphere, and surface temperatures being over 425 degrees Celcius (about 700 K or 800 F) , the likelyhood of humans on Venus is nearly nonexistent to begin with. To combat the hot temperatures and the acidic atmosphere, NASA proposed the idea of a ""blimp"" that floats above the planet's shell. Although the blimp could survive high in the air, the practicality of if is not present. Having a blimp that cannot touch the planet is not going to help scientific research at all. While being above the clouds of Venus, it is impossible to see the surface with human eyes. Seeing the surface would require technology that uses light from the electromagnetic spectrum with a high frequency and short wavelength. It is also impossible to collect rock samples from the planet for soil examination. This idea would not be beneficial enough for the risk of investing a lot of time and money. "
871	Siliscon electronics would be resistent to the harsh conditions on the planet-- for a while. The systems would run for about a month before total failure. these silicon systems are very expensive to bein with and are still in the development phase here on earth. Creating enough silicon circuits to power a rover or vehicle would take years to manufacture. And by the point of satisfactory innovation for silicon electronics, a new product may have been presented. 
872	These basic forms of work require no fragile electronics at all. Using gears, levers, pulleys, and ramrods, corporations have been able to create many devices. When made out of an acid-resistent substance that can withstand high pressure, a mechanical machine may work. The only problem with a mechanical machine is that once on the planet, sure it can do work, but it would be unable to transmit and data findings back to a receiver on a ship or earth. There would be a point where some sort of electronics would be needed. And as of right now, there is not an effective enough invention that could put humans on Venus to live and research. 
873	The author of this article is trying to push a principle that is not fully developed yet. 
874	The reasons that were provided may work after many years of design and development, but right now, none are practical. A combination of the three presented ideas may actually work the best. Use a blimp to float above the planet, tie a cable to the blimp that connects is with machanical machinery, and use silicon electronics to transmit the findings. Damage could be repaired by raising the equipment back up to the blimp. Innovation does not come easy for those who are in charge of it, but ideas like this are needed in providing an answer for a difficult question. 
875	Overall, the author's arguments do not satisfy the overall risk and reward stakes. After more time passes, maybe he will write another article depicting what will work for sure. The support was not presented in a way that was convincing enough to dive right in to this new frontier of space. 
876	in lieu of traditional teacher-designed projects, students should be able to dictate, for themselves, what summer project they wish to accomplish.  
877	While some may argue that student-designed projects encourage lazy and uninspired design, by designing projects themselves, 
878	By having students design their own projects, it increases the likelihood that they have some interest in the completion of said project. 
879	This is because by allowing them to dictate what their project is about, it ensures that the student will select a topic that is interesting to them. This concept of self-selection is already applied to schooling today. For example, the ubiquitous science fair. Within a science fair project, students select a topic and create a science experiment surrounding that topic. By allowing students the freedom to select and design their own science experiment they are interested in, they learn and engage more than if they had, for example, participated in an in-class lab. This is especially important for a summer project due to the fact that, during summer break, students would rather relax than do school work. Especially so if the alternative was to work on a project that they had no say in creating. Essentially, ensuring students are assigned a project they are interested in ensures that they accomplish some learning over their break. 
880	laziness is not the sole reason a student may not complete a summer project. It is possible that they, or their family, have plans that conflict with the completion of an assigned project. For example, if a student were traveling to a location where they did not have access to resources or materials to complete a project. Or, if a student took on a summer job and the assigned task was too time-consuming to work on in conjunction with their job. There are a variety of reasons a student may not be able to complete a project. It is impossible for a teacher to take all possible factors into account for each of their students to design a project that is compatible with their summer plans 
881	By allowing students to design their own projects instead, each student can individually design their project in a way that is compatible with the existing summer plans. 
882	However, both teacher-designed and student-designed projects open up the possibility of lazy work. Teacher-designed projects will inevitably suffer from lazy work while student-designed projects can suffer from lazy design. Either way, students will find ways to work less over their break 
883	However, this assumes that students can design their project without supervision. By requiring teacher approval of a project, teachers can ensure that students design a project that is worth completing, while retaining all other benefits of a student-designed project.  
884	While some may argue that student-designed projects will lead to lazy project design, this can be easily negated while also ensuring that students have an interesting project that they are able to complete over their break. By allowing students to design their own projects, they can choose, for themselves, an interesting topic that they are interested in studying. They can also ensure that the completion of the project is possible within their own summer plans. Student-designed projects lead to project interest and completion more than any teacher-designed project ever could. By having students design their own projects, it ensures a unique and interesting learning experience over their summer break. 
885	Do you use your cell phone while driving? More than half of car accidents that occur are caused by drivers who use their cell phone while driving. Maybe you should think twice about using it while you are driving. Drivers that put a hand on a cell phone while driving can cause them to get distracted and cause an accident. The car accident can lead up to taking a human's life. 
886	Even if the accident is not big it still could have been prevented by not using your cell phone. 
887	Car accidents are one of the main things that are caused by drivers who use their cell phones but it's not the only things that gets caused by using your phone while you're driving. 
888	Sometimes you might pull your phone out at a red light but you don't realize the light has turned green which means you're causing traffic. Traffic is something mostly every driver hates. What if the person behind you has somewhere important to be but thanks to you you're holding them back because you got distracted with your phone? If someone is calling you and you have your phone in your purse or somewhere else in the car you're going to get distracted trying to pull it out of where you have it. If you have Bluetooth on your car you should connect it so it's easier to answer the call without having to try pull your phone out of where it's at. If you do not have Bluetooth, you should try putting your phone on do not disturb so that way you won't have the temptation to want to pull it out. Maybe even fully shut it down or just turn the sound off. 
889	Every day, every hour, every minute as we continue with our life's a car accident occurs due to someone using their phone. Using your cell phone while driving is a big no. 
890	Phone calls are not the only thing that get you distracted while driving but you got to remember your social medias are blowing up which means you're getting a notification every here and there. 
891	Just knowing your friends texted you or someone posted / sent you something you'll most likely want to take a quick little glance at your phone but then that's going to want to make you use it for even longer which gets you distracted. Maybe you don't like what's on the radio so you want to use your aux to you can put a song you actually like if this does occur just wait till you're at red light but as soon as you're done doing that put it away you don't want to cause traffic. All of these things are ways your cell phone can get you distracted.  
892	Stop using your cell phones while the car is on drive. Think about the people who are walking around you and driving around you. What if there's a baby in the car? Let's say you get in an accident you just hit someone's family think about what if that was your family who just got injured because you decided to pull out your phone, because you got distracted liking someone's new Instagram post, because you just had to take a selfie for snapchat. All of that could have waited till you got to your destination. Stop letting these little things get to you. Now think about it was pulling your phone really worth it now you just hurt not only the family but yourself, your car is all distorted. 
893	Everything that just happened could have been stopped if you only would have waited and not let your phone distract you. 
894	A picture, song, video, etc. is not worth you getting yourself hurt or hurting someone else is not worth or even making some have a bad because you made them get stuck in traffic. Maybe you didn't even hurt yourself but you did hurt someone else just because you're ok doesn't mean you couldn't have hurt someone else bad. You need to get use to not having the urge to pull out your phone every time you get a notification. If you an emergency and you just have to use your phone pull over and park somewhere just don't pull it out and think you can multitask we you know you got to pay 100% attention to the road.         
895	The first of which is that Venus is one of the most Earth like planets in our solar system. 
896	The second one is Venus could have once been able to be compatable for life. 
897	Another thing that the author brings up is that Venus has powerful earthquakes and frequent lightning strikes. 
898	The final reason is that the author brings up the challenges that NASA is facing in trying to get to Venus. 
899	What the author is getting to is that when we finally figure out how to get to Venus this could help us get to other planets as well. That is why I think that the author wants us to study Venus. 
900	Venus has a rocky surface similar to that of Earth's. It also has valleys, mountain, and craters all of this is similar to that of Earth's and can be used to maybe help us more understand out planet. Another thing that the author brings up is that Venus is similar to Earth is that scientist believe that Venus was once covered largely with oceans. This means that their could have been life on Venus such as plants. 
901	The troubles that we face is the atmosphere and the pressure. These challenges make it almost impossibe for humans to withstand becase the pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience here on Earth. So what the author is getting at is that if we are able to get through all of these challenges and get boots on the ground on Venus, it would mean that when we are to explore or study another planet we can overcome these challenges much faster. 
902	"Driving can be extremely dangerous for you or anyone else, especially if you're not careful and focused. While driving you must be sure that your taking every precaution you can to maintain safety for yourself and others as well. Many people believe that the use of cell phones can be very hazardous, and I strongly agree with that statement for many reasons. Cell phones have caused fatal wrecks that lead to either death or serious injury. For example, ""an article published by Tony Long states that he was almost killed on his motorcycle while trying to avoid being hit by a reckless driver who was on the phone."" "
903	Cell phones cause late reactions, especially for those that are being held in the driver's hand. 
904	"Majority of people have a habit of allowing their cell phone to influence their reflexes and reactions to certain death-defying situations. One of my resources states, ""Not only are 27 percent of all automobile accidents believed to result from talking or texting while driving, but smartphone use has also been implicated in several recent rail disasters as well."" The use of cell phones while driving a vehicle is just as dangerous as drunk driving, maybe even worse because studies shown that, ""texting and driving slows the reaction time more than being drunk"". Meaning that using a phone while under the wheel can alter a driver's reaction time on the road because your focusing on two things at once, although all your attention should be towards driving and driving only. "
905	Even a two-second distraction - taking your eyes off the road to pick up your phone and see who's calling you for example- increases your risk of crashing 
906	"The National Safety Council reports that, ""answering a text takes away your attention for about five seconds. Traveling at 55 mph, that's enough time to travel the length of a football field."" Anything can happen while you're driving, such as: a car could hit their brakes in front of you, a car could be merging into your lane, traffic might be coming up, or something might jump out into the road. Therefore, you need to keep your eyes on the road at all times with your hands free of anything other than the steering wheel. "
907	"Even with those high numbers, people still choose to be on a cell phone while managing with a vehicle on the road. Some people believe that it is safe to use a phone while driving, or that ""nothing will happen to them"" "
908	In 2017, there were 34,247 distracted driving accidents and 15,341 that were aged between 15 and 29 were involved in fatal crashes while driving with a cell phone in hand. Therefore, some people may believe that using a cell phone while driving isn't dangerous, but the facts say otherwise. 
909	In conclusion, don't operate a vehicle while using a phone at the same time because it can lead to some serious consequences. You are not only endangering yourself but your endangering others on the road, as well as passengers, or even any close-by pedestrians. Driving needs complete attention and focus so ensure the risk of any injuries or deaths because driving is very dangerous. Using a cell phone takes away your focus and attention from driving because now you're trying to multi-task which means you're playing with life or lives. Speaking from experience, cell phones should be banned while driving because they slow your reaction time to anything that may be happening around you. Managing a cell phone while driving is now putting you in a life or death situation that you wouldn't want to be put in.   
910	"People are facinated with the Man on the Moon and the idea of Martians, but most people do not think about life on Venus. Venus is the second planet from the sun and shares many geographical features with Earth. However, studying this planet is made difficult by the dense and toxic atmosphere, high temperatures, and violent weather. Despite this, some people think that Venus should still be explored, and the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" is of this opinion. "
911	The idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers is well supported by the author as seen through the rewards of studying Venus and the progress that has been made towards studying Venus.  
912	First, the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers is well supported by the author as seen through the many rewards of studying Venus 
913	"After laying out the dangers of studying Venus, the author explains why scientists continue to study the planet. ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system"" (4). By studying Venus, astronomers and geologists can predict what might happen to Earth in the future. Gaining an understanding of Earth's future may well allow scientists to predict what happened in Earth's past. Scientists are eager to learn about the early years of Earth's past, as it is shrouded in mystery, and this thirst for knowledge motivates them to study Venus. In describing how similar Venus was to Earth, the author says, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life"" (4). If there was once life on Venus, the similarity between it and Earth would grow. As with geology, if biologists can understand what caused life to cease on Venus, they might be able to predict how life on Venus and on Earth might have started. The author shows that scientists studying Venus reap the reward of being able to learn about Earth's geology and early life. By laying out the various rewards to be had from studying Venus, the author is strengthening his or her argument that Venus should be studied. "
914	Secondly, the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers is well supported by the author as seen through the large amount of progress that has been made towards studying Venus 
915	"Although the author describes how Venus could be studied from the air, scientists still desire to learn about Venus from the planet's surface. One of their solutions to the problem of getting equipment to last on the surface of Venus is to expirement with new materials. ""Simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the choas of Venus's surface and have lasted of three weeks in such conditions"" (7). Research and experimentation taking place on Earth is giving scientists and astronauts more options for studying Venus. Although conditions on Venus are not hospitable to life, these new scientific advances are making it possible for data-gathering equipment to be sent to the surface of Venus and last long enough to gather data. Other scientists are moving away from traditional electronics and looking into purely mechanical systems. ""Systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces"" (7). The alternative that has presented itself to would-be explorers of Venus is older technology, like that found in the earliest computers. Scientists have realized that modern technology is too fragile and that more durable technologies are needed. By turning to other forms of technology, scientists are widening their options for ways to study Venus. The author mentions three different ways that scientists are making progress towards being able to study Venus - from the air, using new materials, and using old technologies. The author's postion that Venus should continue to be studied is supported by the scientific advancements that are serving to make studying Venus a reality. "
916	In conclusion, the author's opinon that Venus should continue to be studied despite the dangers is well supported by the rewards of studying another Earth-like planet and the advancements that have been made towards being able to effectively study Venus. Scientists have strong motivation for studying Venus, and new technologies are making it possible for them to overcome the challenges presented by Venus's harsh terrain. Although scientists studying Venus are unlikely to encounter any life forms, what they do discover will help them to understand Earth's past and shape our future.

921	One way is all the places that you travel to. I have seen many landmarks, such as the Acropolis in Greece, Venice, Italy, and I also have been through the Panama Canal on my way to China. Also it is a fun experience after the animals had to be unloaded, we all played baseball and volleyball games where the animals had been housed. Also there would be table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, and many more fun activities. Those were all some ways we had a fun experience during the program.  
922	Our program also takes care of animals, but that can also be fun in many ways. 
923	My favorite part was traveling to many countries and all the beautiful sights. 
924	New technology is being introduced to mankind almost every second in this world, and now, the latest techonology is a computer program called the Facial Action Coding System which can identify a person's emotions. The question is whether this technology is actually valuable and for what it could be used for. Experts suggest this technology could be used in a classroom to identify the state of mind of a student to adjust the lesson they are trying to comprehend. But, even though this technology may be helpful to teachers trying to keep students active and engrossed in their lessons, the question arises of whether this techonlogy is actually worth the recources or whether what experts think is a great idea is actually an invasion of privacy. 
925	"By the way the article talks about how a ""home PC can't handle the complex algorithms"" and about how complex the system is, it makes people wonder just how much this system would cost and how complicated it would be to enstate said system into a classroom. Compared to a quick survey done by a teacher who asks their students how they feel about their methods of teaching, it is seen how the system would be a waste of recourses and money. "
926	Therefore, although this system is useful in the fact that it can gauge the emotions of the students, it is not much more useful than a teacher who can do the same thing by questioning their students on their preferences and ideas. 
927	Also, although technology is very much improved in these years, it is still not always accurate and infallible, and therefore may not be suitable for a classroom. 
928	"The article states that the technology associates each emotion with ""characteristic movements of the facial muscles"" and then uses those movements to calculate the spectrum of emotions based on their facial display. But some people show emotions in various ways, and the technology most likely cannot accomodate for the many different ways people express the same emotion. For example, if a student has a resting face that seems generally happy, the system might confuse this dazed face as a satisfied face and think that the student is happy with their lessons when they are actually confused or not paying attention. In the same way, if a student has a resting face that looks naturally sad, the system may think they are unhappy with their lessons, even if the student feels they are learning a lot. A lot of students also try to hide their emotions, like frusteration or sadness, with a happier look on their face, and even though the article states that the system can detect a ""false smile"", it cannot always be accurate as a person may be good at hiding their emotions and displaying a genuine smile. Therefore, since technology is not always accurate and because human beings are so various in the way they behave, the technology would not be useful in a classroom where it may misread a student's state of mind and lead them in the wrong path of education. "
929	"Lastly, if the physical problems of the technology have not already been offputting, then maybe the moral problem of this technology will sway opinions against using it in a classroom. If this technology really can ""indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one"", then this means it can invade people's privacy and indicate an emotion which a person is trying to hide. "
930	If a student is feeling sad or feeling stressed about home problems which they are trying to conceal, then the technology detects this and displays it for the teacher and the electronic lesson to see. This is an invasion of privacy, as the teacher does not need to know about a student's homelife or about their feelings outside the classroom. A teachers job should be to monitor how their students are feeling about their lessons, not about how their students are feeling about their life outside of school, and since this technology could pick up on digressing feelings, it should not be used in a classroom where a student's internal feelings are revealed to a teacher. Therefore, using Facial Action Coding could end up being an invasion of privacy that should not be introduced to the classroom. 
931	The Facial Action Coding System is a bad idea for the classroom, as it could incorrectly read a student's emotions and give a misleading output that puts a student off track in their education, and also because it could invade a student's privacy of their inner mind. 
932	Therefore, installing this system in schools would be a waste of money and recourses, especially when teachers can gauge how their students are learning by simply asking their students in an anonymous survey how they feel about their teaching methods. In this society, technology is used to fix almost everything, but in this case, scientists should quit trying to force technology on behavioral issues and just let humans interact so they can benefit themselves with communication, no computerized middleman needed. 
933	So picture you're at home, burdened with homework, rushing to get it all done and all of a sudden, your parent gets an email from the school saying that every student will have to take one extracurricular activity. Your parents are worried because extracurricular activities are expensive, how you'll get to and from that activity, and your school work. How fair is that? It puts stress on you and your family. 
934	They Are Really Expensive 
935	Some popular activities are dance, martial arts, sports, and music. Which are all VERY expensive. They are great extracurricular activities to do, but so expensive, and not all parents can afford them. For dance, costumes are at least $100, dance shoes vary on quality, but are usually expensive, dance wear is about $30-$50 per piece, and makeup, lots and lots of makeup. Plus, you usually have to know how to sew, and if you don't already, you might have to add the expense of sewing classes in there. See how they all add up? That's about $230 for just costumes, dance wear and shoes. Let's say your parent is a teacher, the average teacher makes $65,000 per year which isn't that much. Some even make $35,000 per year, even less. And to have school expenses, plus that, that's a huge chunk of your parent's paycheck. Some parents have to use that money to pay rent or mortgage, heating bills, water bills, electricity bills, and extra things like clothes, and food. That doesn't give them that much of a flexible amount to spend. Some kids prefer to save their parent's money, plus if they dont want to take one, that's even more unfair. 
936	They Won't Be Committed To It 
937	Let's say the options the school provides are all not of interest to them, so they're forced to take something they don't want to do. How would you like to be forced to commit to something you didn't want to do to start with? I'm pretty sure no one would want that. Though extracurricular activities are great for students to do, some are just reserved and are shy when having to do things in front of people. For students with anxiety, that is extremely embarrassing. Plus, if you force someone to do something they don't want to do, they'll just do it with half-effort and that makes everything one step harder for the people who actually wanted to do that activity. I can almost guarantee that this will happen if schools force students to do this, and it'll just make the activities less fun for the ones who actually want to do it. 
938	They May Have Other Things To Do 
939	in middle school, there's a lot of homework, even more so in high school. A lesson is usually about an hour and a half long. School ends at 3:30, so they'd get home at 5:00. 5 or 6 is the most common dinner time, and it usually lasts about 30 minutes. That's 5:30. Then, they have to go and try to finish their homework. If they have a lot of it, it can take a long time, and can usually lead to them putting off important stuff, like personal hygiene (GROSS!). They're probably super exhausted from their activity, and just want to take a shower. But nope, they have to do the rest of their homework. Depending on how much they have, they could end up staying up really late. Highschoolers can usually end up staying up until 3 am in the morning doing homework. That makes them more tired and not ready to focus the next day. It could've saved them so much more if they didn't have to do the activity. 
940	Though extracurricular activities are great for them, dont force them on people, because instead of helping, it's actually hurting.  
941	Summer projects are some of the most dreaded assignments to give to a student. However, they are very necessary in order for students to retain information needed for the following school year. 
942	Summer projects, involving schools, should be teacher-designed in order to optimize students's learning. 
943	a teacher knows what to assign best based on the class curriculum. 
944	If students were to all decide what the project was and how it should be done, then there would be a multitude of topics and confusion amongst the class. In seventh grade we were given a choice assignment to do. Although it was a fun project and allowed us to use creativity, it didn't lead us to the same information. In a summer project, the main purpose being to continue learning, a student-designed project may not be the best way to learn about a common topic.  
945	If a student were to design his or her project, they would likely take the easy route in order to enjoy the rest of their summer 
946	"Although I have many positive qualities, I am known to take the easy route when it comes to a lot of things. In my fifth grade science fair we were allowed to decide our own experiments to do. Instead of trying to think of a topic that may attract viewers at my booth, or something that interested me, I chose the most basic experiment I could think of, ""which paper airplane would fly the farthest."" When it comes to school students are prone to rush through any work given. Like myself, they'd take the easy route and limit their own capabilities. "
947	Summer projects are important for schools and teachers to implement whether it be student-designed or teacher-designed. However in the case of productivity, teacher-designed projects bear more benefits. School year flow, class content, and a student's work habits all play roles in why teacher-designed projects should be the main source of assignments given over the summer. 
948	Imagine this: it's the last day of school, and after ten months of constant, grueling work, you have finally completed the school year. However, you learn a project has been assigned over summer break; a project which requires a lot of your time, and a lot of your effort. Not only that, but it is on a boring, irrelevant topic, which you have absolutel zero interest in; is this fair? Students get put through extreme amounts of stress over the span of the school year, and summer vacation is their break from the large amount of work and effort that they put in over the course of their 300 day journey. 
949	Although it is essential for students to continue to actively use their brain during their break, it is essential that the project should be student designed, 
950	their increased inclination to work on something that they find interesting, 
951	the fact that it is their break from school. 
952	School has been around for centuries, and although it is completely different now than how it once was, some things have remained the same; for example, the procrastination of students. Majority of students, nowadays especially with the amount of distractions they have, find themselves doing nothing all day and beginning their homework at 11:00 PM. When it comes to summer, the same applies; especially if given a topic they do not find interesting or relevant to them. If given a topic that bores them, then they will likely wait until the last month to even begin the project. This renders the project completely useless, as it's primary purpose was to ensure that the student remains mentally active throughout their summer break 
953	However, it must be taken into account that it is their summer break: something that is looked forward too year round and a break from the long, tiresome school year that they just completed 
954	Some may claim that the project must be chosen by teachers, as it is their occupation and that they know what is best for the students to succeed. 
955	Although this is correct, regardless of whether or not the summer assignment is chosen by teachers or students, it's primary purpose will still be fulfilled: to keep the student's brain active throughout the break. In fact, if chosen by students, the chances of the goal to be fulfilled greatly increase, contrary to how it would be if it were to be chosen by teachers. 
956	The life of a student is extremely difficult; they are forced to do things that most adults cannot even do. They are told to somehow find time for everything: school work, sports, hobbies, family, friends, and most importantly to be a kid. During the school year, the fact that the student is still a kid is most times forgotten. Summer vacation is their chance to finally be a kid, or at least feel like one. By allowing the student to take part in a student designed project,they are able to take part in activities that they actually want to do, or research things that they are actually interested in. It is always hard to find compromise, but if given an option to satisfy students as well as teachers, why not choose it? 
957	A child could get bored or distracted easily, but if that can be detected ahead of time, the process would be shifted to hold the focus of the student 
958	What if the student does not understand what is being taught to them throught the computer teaching? Well, the computer can read their expression and accomodate to the needs of the learner. Likewise, the student could be ahead of what is being taught, academically, which could be read by the facial decoder and adjusted in their lessons 
959	Teachers could then track that data to further helps their students. 
960	Being able to automatically adjust to the needs of their user in a classroom would benefit the students and teachers of a school. 
961	"If a student becomes bored or distracted while using computer programs, it can turn the student off from the lesson. This technology ""can make computer-animated faces more expressive"" in any interactive activities the student might encounter to hold its attention (D'Alto). Also, layouts, fonts, prints, etc. could be altered to make the lesson more interesting to the user, therefore catching the student's attention with something it deems fun. "
962	While some children become uninterested or lack focus, some students just do not have the correct cirriculum for their academic needs 
963	"By using facial coding, the computer could adjust the lesson like a human tutor would. for those students struggling to understand the certain area, the computer would ""modify the lesson like an effective human instructor"" (D'Alto).  Likewise, some students are above the level they are given, academically, and need more of a challenge. Through reading their emotions, the computer could arrange harder concepts for the student. "
964	"It is hard for teachers to truly know how a student is fairing in all areas of school. So, by tracking their students' data, the teacher can make additional adjustments to either get the student help, or create a better challenge that will grow their education. In using facial coding programs to calculate how their students are doing, the teacher can appeal to whatever needs their students may have, and even find out if a student is having an ""off day "
965	Based on the evidence given in the article, the use of Facial Action Coding Stystems in the classroom would be wildly valuable. The computer can detect many levels of emotion to accomodate their program to the students' needs. If a particular lesson bores a student or that student has lack of focus, the computer can adjust and change many aspects of thier layout to catch the student's attention. Also, students can receive the correct level of work- whether that be too easy or too hard. And not only can students benefit, but teachers, as well. They can track student progress to further accomodate their needs. While technology can be used for many unethical things, the Facial Action Coding System would be extremely effective in a school setting.     
966	Over the summer, schools require students to do a few projects to make sure they continue learning. Over a three month long break, it is easy to forget material and or not feel motivated to learn new material. Assigning projects will help encourage and enforce students to continue learning. The debate is, should teachers assign the projects or should students design their own projects. Teachers may have more knowledge and experience creating projects but if students are allowed to create their own projects, they will benefit from that experience because they got to chose what was most important for themselves to work on. They will also likely make it more broad, which allows students to make each project more individualized, each project will have a special twist to it. It will also be more discussed, it will become a trend to talk about it, students will likely feel more pressured to do it if everyone talks about it. Students will also come up with enriched new project ideas. 
967	the projects will help students figure out what they need to improve also allowing them to improve themselves. 
968	if they know how much time and hard work came with making it they will likely appreciate it more. 
969	"If they appreciate it more, they are also more likely to try harder on the project then they would have otherwise. They will also think it's a better idea if they formulated it rather than the teacher. People tend to love and appreciate their ideas more than other people's ideas. Even now, their are a lot of students who complain that they don't like the projects given to them. A lot of students blame the teacher if they got a bad grade on a test or a project but with this idea, they do not have someone to blame so they will be more pressured to do the project. Even though teachers have more knowledge and experience, students know what they themselves need to work on and improve with. Giving them control and a free opportunity to dive in deeper in areas they need more improvement in would make students be thankful towards the school. Some students may not take advantage of this but schools still need to keep faith that the majority would. The students who don't, probably also would not do it if it was teacher assigned it, but hearing ""student made"" is encouraging. Therefor, more students would get it done rather then if it was teacher made. "
970	Having the projects be student made will ensure it will be more discussed, which will have beautiful outcomes. 
971	Students will be challenged to think of ideas that will benefit them as well as new ideas teachers did not think of. There's more students then teachers, someone is bound to think of a new unique idea. Students will have a chance to make their summer projects fun and something to look forward to. Another reason is teachers assign projects but sometimes they get busy and can't think of new ideas or don't have time to discuss with other teachers to find the best idea. Students on the other hand, probably have thousands of ideas they've wanted to do but were never given the chance. They also have a younger mind that may have different ideas then a older mind would have. Students are also with each other more than teachers are, they will discuss more, if they're allowed to make it fun, it may become a trend to talk about. These projects may also bring students together, if they are working together to make a project they all agree on, that;s teamwork. They may also check in on each other for inspiration and or just because this experience successfully made them closer. This also may create some useful peer pressure to do their work and learn. Maybe this will lead to students doing work more often overall and bonding with their peers with learning. Learning will become more than a individual process and more than just reading from a text book. 
972	It is important to take a minute and consider what you want to learn, how you'll learn it, as well as what areas you need more education in. 
973	This experience will give students more control and prepare them for college. It is important for kids, especially teenagers to understand how to use control and work independently. If they get to design a project, they will start thinking about their education and what they like verses don't like. This will teach them how to figure that out on their own with a little bit of support, preparing them for the real world. When they start discussing, it will continue to help them think how to make the project and themselves more individual. 
974	Yes this may just be a small few projects they do over the summer 
975	but it can be seen as so much more than that. It will improve everyone's ability to work with others, which is a crucial skill in life. It will be challenging to combine and compromise on different ideas. If used correctly, you can figure out more about yourself, for example, if you like to work individually verses in a group, what kind of learning style you want the project to be, what the project is on, how much work you're willing to put into it, and so many other things. 
976	students should be making the projects for summer break instead of teachers because they will appreciate it more, the project will be more discussed, and the projects will help students figure out what they need to improve also allowing them to improve themselves. This will provide a amazing opportunity and experience for students which will cause them to love the school even more. New ideas will stem from this as well as a new found love for learning and education.  
977	Soccer team, basketball team, football team, drama club, yearbook club, student council, math club, marching band and more. So many sport teams and school clubs available to any student, usually free, but still some students conclude that they don't want to do any activities after school. 
978	Students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it is beneficial to every aspect of their life. 
979	Extracurricular activities can help improve students' social skills 
980	If a student is playing a sport it will help him/her get outside and get fresh air after hours of being stuck inside school. 
981	Playing a sport will require exercise making the students healthier and therefore happier. 
982	Extracurricular activities are powerful learning tools because students are learning while having fun. 
983	Students on sport teams might learn about teamwork and the positive effect of good sportsmanship while students in drama club might learn about how to project your voice and speak confidently on stage, two very important traits if you want to be a leader. 
984	Many students use homework as an excuse not to participate in after-school activities 
985	But that problem can be easily fixed because there are several clubs and teams that meet once a week or even meet on the weekend. 
986	Another excuse is that the price to participate in these activities is too much. 
987	But that problem can also be fixed easily because there are several free clubs available to students. 
988	Extracurricular activities should be made mandatory because they help students socially and health wise, are educational and can guide students to new interests and goals, and can be a very small commitment that doesn't interrupt homework. They can do all that while still being very fun and exciting. Schools are offering teams and clubs that are fun, educational, and can be joined without any disadvantage, they deserve to be mandatory.                  
989	You meed new people when you join new clubs and make new friend ships. 
990	There's a new kind of technology called Facial Action Coding System, or FACS, which enables computers to identify human emotions. The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is very valuable 
991	"Like in ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto, it could be used to show when a kid is becoming bored and let the teacher know so that the instructor could switch the lesson up to grab the kid's attention "
992	Another effective was it could be used would be for it to show how some kids are feeling to limit them getting into any kinds of trouble. 
993	And finally it could be used to detect if one student just isn't grasping the matter of the subject that everyone else is getting with no problem. There are endless ways this technology could be used to better a classroom and this technology should be used in a classroom with students. 
994	"In the article, Nick D'Alto used a quote from Dr. Huang which was ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor. "
995	In addition to keeping everyone awake, FACS could be used to keep people who aren't feeling too good get better. 
996	Everyone deals with things that others probably don't know about. With FACS a student could come into class like Charlie and no one knows about his frustrations so they try to do their normal jokes and games with him. If a student ever comes into class not feeling the best or not wanting to be bothered, FACS could sense that and instead of people messing with that kid or having that kid be bothered, that child could have the option of being away from everyone while the child cools down. That could stop the child from being involved in a physical altercation or any altercations at that. 
997	Finally, everyone knows that all children learn at their own speed. FACS could be used to find out whose stuck on someting that everyone is flying through.  
998	When the teacher is teaching something that everyone but one student understands and the teacher stops for questions, that one student may feel too embarrassed to ask a question so the lesson would go on and only get more difficult as time goes by. Instead of that happening, FACS would let the teacher know what kid that is so that the teacher could reach out to the kid and give them extra practice or even a little tutoring if they need it, that could really be a huge help to children that don't learn as fast as others. Usong FACS to determine that could really translate for the great or good of the grades of students everywhere. 
999	In order to make the classroom a more happy place, a better place, FACS should be used with students. FACS could detect bordem so that no kid is bored enough to drift into space or sleep and miss valuable work time. FACS would be good for keeping kids that are dealing with things away from people that'll trigger them. Also FACS can be used to show weather or not children have questions and need help but are embarrassed to say so. The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is very valuable. 
1000	Stop with the constant use of cars. 
1001	"I'm not saying to completely stop using your vehicles, although we might see a larger change than expected, what I'm saying is to manage your car usage wisely. Every time we pick up the keys, start our engine and take off to the nearest grocery store, we add a larger threat to the environment. In 'Paris Bans Driving Due To Smog' by Robert Duffer, it informs of the enforcement France is taking to clean up it's polluted cities. Duffer shows us how ""the smog"" that invades the city became a rival to Beijing, China, which is known as the most polluted cities in the world. Imagine going outside to see the beautiful sun, and instead open the door to cars delivering blinding ""smog."" "
1002	"There's some of us who suffer from stress and anxiety. There's some of us who look at our community and are probably never wanting to go outside again. That is not a community to live in. We deserve to feel relieved, relaxed, and renewed from time to time. In 'Car-Free Day Is Spinning Into a Big Hit in Bogota' by Andrew Selsky, it demonstrates a perfect example. Selsky writes about a ""Car-Free"" day in Bogota, Columbia, and a man shares his side of this event. Carlos Arturo Plaza tells us, ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air polluton."" Selsky writes in paragraph 28 the benefits of this event. He writes, ""Parks and sport centers bloomed... Dramatically cut traffic... New restaurants and shopping districts developed."" Look what we can accomplish from not using our cars as much. "
1003	"We're in a time where money is the top priority in our lives. All those gas prices, and the car insurance car owners must pay is ridiculous. Sometimes people can't even sleep at night due to all the thinking of ""how will I pay this?"", or ""how will I pay that?"" It later becomes a constant battle. This is when technology comes in handy. Now with the common ""Facebook"" and other social media, we're able to connect more and more. It's sad to see people waste their money going to a friends house for probably an hour or so, when they can just talk virtually. Elisabeth Rosenthal, writer of 'The End of Car Culture,' most likely will agree with me. Rosenthal inputs Mimi Sheller's say in all this. Sheller is a sociology professor at Drexel University, and she cites important factors on paragraph 35. ""Internet makes telecommuting possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends."" "
1004	Why drive and pay for gas when you can get on the web? You'll be glad you did. 
1005	"Now, many will be able to disagree with me saying that, ""we need cars to drive long distances,"" or, ""I rather pay and have my own privacy then be with twenty people I don't know on a bus."" "
1006	That's fine. I'm not saying to wipe out the fact that you have a car, all I'm saying is to use it wisely. Drive long distances, not short ones that can take you ten minutes to walk. 
1007	"""What about the people who work in car companies?"" "
1008	Well, if we all followed what Bogota is doing and develop shopping districts and renewal companies, I'm sure there will be many jobs available. No matter the pay, you'll still have no worry about your automobile bills, which will help you save a huge amount of money. 
1009	We need to save ourselves from driving and polluting the earth, or else we won't have a great life to live. Blinding smog will cover the sky, and many won't be able to enjoy the rich outside there once was. All we will see are streets instead of parks. We need to stop ourselves from driving too much in order to live to the fullest.    
1010	Have you ever been faced with a boring computer assignment? Maybe you have dreaded coming to school or finishing your homework? As technology is advancing and more of the classroom is found through an electronic device, some students may find themselves losing interest in their daily lessons. What if this could be changed by a system that takes your facial expressions into account and accomodates to your mood? Right when the assignment has begun to lose your interest, this system could sense the change and alter the lesson plan to regain your interest. 
1011	The Facial Action Coding System may be valuable and allow for improvement to be made within classrooms and within students.  
1012	Initially, as technology is advancing daily and students find themselves online more often, this system could improve their lessons. 
1013	"Electronics as of now are programmed to teach a student however are unable to sense how the student is feeling or how they are actually doing on their assignment. As the author states in the article, ""most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"" something which computers are unable to detect (para. 6). Not only this, but the author gives an analogy that states ""if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a smilar ad might follow"" and explains that in a classroom, similar techniques can be applied to benefit the student (para. 6). Using this program will allow technology to advance and in turn will benefit the student. "
1014	"When Dr. Huang describes how this system can engage a student he states, ""[the computer] could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" and further explains that ""[the system] could modify the lesson"" to acomidate to the students needs (para. 6). In a normal classroom, when the teachers method of teaching is confusing students, the teacher should find a different way of teaching to engage students. The author also explains how the system is able to read six different emotions and can ""identify mixed emotions"" to allow the system to see if their methods are benefitting the student (para. 4). This computer system would be valuable when keeping the students engaged. "
1015	"It is no secret that many students dread coming to school, whether it be from stress, bullying, or simply not understanding the subjects. This system can pick up on a fake emotion, the author explains how it can read a ""fake smile"" and that to them ""faces don't lie"" (para. 8). If this system is able to sense when a student is unhappy or angry, this could be used as an advantage in helping the student. Not only this, but the author explains that ""moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but may even help produce them"" (para. 9). Taking both of these statements into account, and allowing them to be incorporated into the classroom, students may enjoy attending school and learning new things. "
1016	Consequently, this system would be valuable to classrooms and would allow for improvement to be made within schools and the students. Overall, it is evident that computers are unable to read emotions and reciprocate to the individual adequately. This system might prove to reengage students in their learning, and improve their moods altogether. 
1017	The future. Everyone wonders what it will look like, what it will be like but that is up to our future generations . The young people today will eventually be our future. They will be the ones we look up to for solutions and ideas. By having extracurricular activities be a must in schools we are only making school systems better and by making school systems better we are making our future better. There are so many fun yet different extracurricular activities for everyone such as dance, student council or debate. 
1018	it will give the students a chance to explore their passions, 
1019	it will provide them an opportunity to make life-long friends 
1020	it will benefit the schools participating.  
1021	By providing students the chance to participate in extracurricular activities, you are letting them get a head-start in life. By trying out different activities, they will be able to determine which one they like the most and want to pursue as a career. Many students in high school still don't know what career path they want to pursue, but students who had to do an extracurricular will already know which one they prefer to others. Thus, they won't be puzzled by the time they have to choose a career. Additionally, participating in extracurricular activities will help strengthen their resume when they need it. A student who has done multiple extracurricular activities will be preferred to another student who has not done any. Furthermore, my sister, Generic_Name, never knew what career she wanted to pursue until she took a building class as an extracurricular in 9th grade. She instantly fell in love with it and could use that extracurricular class as a bonus on her resume. She is now in her first year at Yale, studying engineering. This shows why extracurricular activities will help students discover their passion. 
1022	Every year, many new kids will move to the area and come to a new school so providing an additional way to get to know others is needed. The new kid will be able to connect with others that share similar interests and it will make the whole moving process much easier. In addition, having a friend that shares the same interests as you will make your bond much stronger and make you much better friends. This program will also benefit shy kids or students who are more quiet and reserved. It will help them because in school they might be more quiet if they don't feel comfortable or if none of the subjects interest them. However, if they are in an environment where they enjoy what they are doing and are with people like them they will be more likely to branch out. When I was nine, my school required I do a sport. Thus, I decided to do swim team. When I started the sport I was new to town. We had just moved from California to Virginia so I did not have many friends. However, I made many friends quite easily because of swim team. I made friends faster than usual since we shared similar interests. We all liked swimming and we would all have friendly competitions. We even took trips together which made our bond even stronger. We helped each other through hard times. Even though, two of my friends from swim team switched schools I am still very close friends with all of them. The bond we created will last a life time. 
1023	It will keep students busy and occupied; thus, they won't get into trouble as much. I was once told that if you are bored, it can often lead to trouble because if you're busy you have no time to make trouble.  Also, by having students do extracurricular activities it will seem as if the school gives off lots of well rounded students who have many skills. This will seem very impressive. Lastly, the school's students will most likely have a higher grade point average (GPA) and better scores in general compared to schools who don't require extracurricular activities. This is because studies show that students who do extracurricular activities such as sports or clubs have done better in academics and will learn time management and balance better than other kids. This is why enforcing extracurricular activities will improve schools. 
1024	schools should adopt a new policy of having students preform at least one extracurricular activity. This is a great way to help students find their passion, make new friends and better the schools. Students will be to find an extracurricular that sparks interest for them and hopefully it will turn out to be their career. They will also be able to make strong friendships through this program. It will also ease the anxiety of making friends for new kids. Lastly, the program will benefit schools by making their students more well rounded, increasing the overall GPA of their students and help keep students occupied and out of trouble after school. In fact, all schools in America should decide to make this a requirement. Not only will it make our school systems better but it will also improve our students; which are our future. The students in our schools today will eventually become leaders, officials, activists, doctors, lawyers, actors and politicians. So if this program will better schools and the lives that hold our future then there should be no question about implementing it.                   
1025	Summer projects are no fun, but they are a great way for students to be engaged in their studies over the long summer break. In my experience, whenever I had summer projects given to me by a teacher, I did better in the class because on the first day of school I already had some knowledge of the topic. 
1026	it will make it easier on their students, 
1027	help them learn about a new topic they never researched before. 
1028	Students are busy in the Summer, witch is why a teacher- designed projects are better for them. It may be summer break, but most students get jobs or go on vacation with their family, this is where a teacher designed project is better. If all the Student has to do is follow the teachers outline instead of coming up with ways to make a unique project on a topic they have never learned of before. The ideal summer project is also not one that is supposed to be tedious, but one that will help student gain the basic knowledge needed for the class. Not a super stressful project that is left for the students to do with no outline or help from the teacher. I think because this is the first time the students are learning about this topic it is better if the teacher makes a template for the students to follow so they do the correct research. It will also take the stress of their chest so they can enjoy a nice summer break but learn at the same time.  
1029	Researching a topic you never learned of before is a hard task, especially in the summer witch is why summer projects should be teacher- designed. 
1030	When learning about a new subject it is better if someone is there to help you, instead of jumping into a project. Then you have to do a lot more research and it may not all be correct, and you wont be able to tell because this is your first time learning about the topic. If a teacher was there help guide you through the project it will make the research easier and more reliable. Another benefit is that Students will focus more on the learning part of the project more because they dont have to make their own with the little to no information they know about the topic. I feel the like a whole student- designed project is too stressful for them to do in the summer, because they lack the knowledge and discipline, so if it was teacher orientated it is a guarantee that the students will learn the correct criteria. A teacher- designed project is more beneficial to the kids rather than a student- designed. 
1031	Not everyone agrees with me, some people will say that a student designed project is more beneficial for the kids. They will argue, and say its summer the students should do their own project and do it in their own time. 
1032	That wouldnt work because they dont know anything about the topic, and they will procrastinate and do it the last week of the summer making it rushed and it wont be beneficial to them at all. 
1033	They might also argue that students dont want to be pestered about how teacher want the work to be and it is a time for a little freedom and they can do a fun project that they deigned all by them self. 
1034	Pushing creativity is good for students, but in I feel like a summer project is something you do so you can have knowledge of the topic when school starts, instead of something fun youll forget about in a week or two 
1035	"In 1976 the face looked like a face. In 1998 it started to not look like a face at all. In 2001 it just looked like a rock. So i believe that it was not created by aliens but that it was just something the olanet had made itself. This has certainly got the attention of the people.  The ""Face on Mars"" is not a face. If you look at the pictures from 1976, and 1998, and 2001 and in the text it says that the photo from 2001 is the most recent photo that NASA has. It still looks nothing like a face so since the 2001 picture is the most recent it shows that it is just a natural landform. It is just a natural landform. On Mars there are natural landforms everywhere and the fade away. Here on earth natural landforms are created everyday. "
1036	For example if an emergency occurs and someone is trying to get a hold of you, you would need your cell phone to stay in contact. Another example is if you are lost you can call someone for directions 
1037	One reason is students should be able to learn what they want 
1038	Another reason is the students will most-likely make their project shorter to complete which means more time to enjoy summer break. 
1039	 Whenever you have a project it's always more exhaustive to complete when you are not passionate about the subject. When you are able to pick and choose the topic of what you learn though, you get inspired and are excited to do the project. I think that it is pertinent for students to have a strong passion for their work, it makes it far more enjoyable to do. For example, in my middle school, I was able to design my own project over the summer, and for the first time I actually had fun working, unlike my teacher made projects 
1040	It is highly necessary for the youth to learn attributes and skills they are personally interested in so when they get a job they know what their doing and are not filled with useless knowledge they don't need. 
1041	I also think that having a break is warranted if you are working hard, it helps rejuvenate and recollect yourself. Students need breaks and giving them an unnecessarily long project to do over their vacation takes that away from them. Families are also busy over break with traveling and seeing family members. Most of the time students lack the time to really put their best effort into their work 
1042	If you let students decide their workload and limit they will have a favorably less stressful summer vacation, giving them the rightful break they deserve. 
1043	I strongly believe that all schools that require a summer project should let their students decide what they want to accommodate their knowledge with not the teachers. Still, on the other hand, people might want teachers to create the projects, but students don't usually learn anything valuable to their selves if they aren't interested in the subject. So in conclusion, students should be permitted to mold their own summer break projects. Then at the end of the day, everyone is satisfied and able to learn what they want, letting students enjoy the vacation they are given. 
1044	Throughout reading this article I thought it provided very good and extensive research. Although I did see some major issues with the leading point of the passage. This author provided very good research but the research and evidence throughout the entire article controdicted their main message. 
1045	To make this article better, more evidence on why studying venus is benefical should be provided to support their claim.  
1046	"In this article the evidence they use for example: ""These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals"" and also ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus"" supports the controdicting claim that going to Venus is too dangerous with too many complications. "
1047	I dont disagree that going to Venus will gain us insight on the planet, spark imagination, and create innovation 
1048	Some good things about this passage is that they do provide great evidence and research. They provide input from NASA and NASA's insight on the whole thing and a possible solution. They also provide facts about the atmosphere and about the conditions of the planet. Them providing all this evidence helps the reader themselves have almost enough information to come up with their own opinion on the topic. 
1049	"Overall this article's information and research was great and really did inform me about the planet, but the conclusion ruiened it all. The whole time (paragraphs 1-7) the author lead all the readers to believe that going to Venus has too many dangers and isnt in our best interest, yet the conclusion stated that going to Venus would be a great oppurtunity and that ""Our travels on earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"". If the passage had evidence all throught that going to Venus is beneficial, it would be a perfect article but i was all around confused when I found out the author was all for going to Venus and it ruiened and confused the whole article.          "
1050	I say there is no time because students have homework, jobs, or even take care of a family member. 
1051	"Scientists and more specifically astronomers are extremley fascinated in Earth's sister planet, Venus, as it is similar to Earth in certain ways, and is a close enough distance for travel. Venus was believed to once be very similar to Earth in terms of its geology, so therefore scientists are interested in discovering how the features have changed. However, the author of ""The Challenge Exploring Venus,"" explains the great dangers that the planet offers for both humans and technology to explore the planet. The act of returning to Venus seems impossible due to the risks, although the insight that is wanted to be gained on the planet could lead to ""intimidating endeavors."" "
1052	The author claims that the studying of Venus is still an active pursuit despite the dangers that come along with it. The claim is supported well 
1053	The author tells the story of previous missions that have been sent to Venus in hopes to persuade the audience that the planet's harsh conditions are too intense for even high technology to withstand 
1054	"He mentions, ""...no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades."" This quote uses ethos to ensure the reliablity of the author, and to emphasize that scientists are truly struggling to develop devices that are well enough developed to explains the dangers. The understanding that technology made by scientists who have succesfully researched across the milky way cannot withstand Venus's circumstanes demonstrates how dangerous the planet is.  "
1055	The use of statistics is presented by the author to take a more logical view on their argument to prove the dangers of Venus 
1056	"The article mentions that ""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent blankets Venus."" As carbon dioxide is waste product of human respiration, the inhalation of this gas would be very dangerous for life to visit Venus. It also says that ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Farenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" Without shelter that can withold these extreme temperatures and amounts of pressure, the human body, similar to the spacecrafts, would be lucky to survive for more than a few hours. These numbers support the author's claim to focus on the horrific dangerous of exploring Venus to present a logical standpoint on this issue. "
1057	Throughout the article, it suggests that studying Venus is still a worthy mission for astronomers, however, the dangers that come along with these missions are extremely dangerous and life-threatening. The author mentions the curiosity that scientists have involving Earth's sister planet, and the desire to still visit Venus regardless of the harsh conditions. With the article's use of both previous experiences of missions and spacecrafts, as well as shocking factual statistics of Venus, the claim is very strongly supported with evidence.  
1058	teachers can integrate what they will teach 
1059	they also have professional experience. 
1060	 One main reason summer projects should be teacher-designed is that teachers can integrate what they will be teaching. 
1061	A small, but very important thing teachers have in common is that they have a lesson plan. A lesson plan is what teachers utilize to understand what curriculum they will teach and how they will teach it. As a result, the teacher can use the curriculum as their foundation of the project. For example, the International Baccalaureate, IB, program requires students to complete a Summer Reading Project. As an IB student, I had to complete it this past summer. We had a list of books to choose from, and we had to write an essay about the message of the book and make a poster about what we learned from the book. What I didn't realize, was that the book had a connection to what we were going to learn in class. The project helped the students make a connection to the class and learn faster and more efficiently. This results would not be possible, if a student designed the project so this is why summer project should be designed by a teacher. 
1062	Another reason summer projects should be teacher-designed is, because they have more professional experience than students. 
1063	Teachers most go to college to become teachers and be hired by a school. This means: they have a degree on education, are certified to be teachers, and they understand the subject better than students. In addition, they have experience from previous years and students. So they understand that students learn differently. Consequently, they can come up with a method to make the project educative and impactful for every student; regardless, of how different they learn. For these reasons, the summer projects should be teacher designed.  
1064	Some may argue that summer projects should be student-designed, because students understand each other. 
1065	It's bias, because students are often with their friend group which often understand each other. On the other hand, friend groups are all different, meaning they have different beliefs and values. Another reason, the statement is bias is that students have different learning styles. A student can be a fast learner and don't need to study as hard as others students; however, another student might need more reinforcement to learn. 
1066	So if a student was to design a project it would be based on their personal preference and not about everyone. Concluding, that summer projects should not be designed by students because they can be bias. 
1067	The distinct responsibility of having students learn rests on the very shoulders of teachers throughout nine out of the twelve months that are in a year, so the students should direly be permitted to design how they learn over the three month break that they get. This three month break, summer, to most students, is a time where they can finally let go of all their responsibilities and worries and leave them right in the classroom. Most do not think twice about what they have learned over the past semester, but instead are already steps ahead on planning what events. attractions, and/or vacations they may embark on. Teachers still try to make an effort for learners to still store information they have learned and even try add on to it by assigning projects that are aimed directly for students to complete by the next school year. More often than not, projects are long-term, and that causes the student to be continuously involved with the material and truly grasp the knowledge coming at them. 
1068	they are more likely to retain the knowledge, 
1069	it lets them express their creativity and uniqueness, 
1070	they would be more inclined to complete the project. 
1071	Every student will be likely to design a different version of the project and there will be no barriers to how they can let their creative minds visualize the project and ultimately complete it. Having them let their brain-storming abilities to take over and conceptualize on how they will continue to tackle the task at hand, truly sets them up for active learning and teaches them very useful future skills that they will use. Varying on the topic, students can create physical projects such as posters or tri-folds, or they can create online projects such as graphs or tables. Having the ability to express your mind is something that can not be so easily undermined or the very learning that is so emphasized in today's educational system will have failed. 
1072	To actually learn an individual needs to be able to understand the knowledge that is going through their mind as they work on assignments, and there is truly no better way to learn than to self-learn while working on a project. Unlike tests or any other sort of assignment, projects give students more of a chance to actually learn rather than just memorizing knowledge for a sort period of time and then forgetting it the second they turn in the assignment. Making sure that their mind is continuously being subjected to complete the assignment over a long period of time consequently burns the knowledge into their brain and helps them to better retain it. Having students do the designing portion of the assignment as well would lead to even more learning due to them needing to know the content first and then being able to correctly complete it with no errors. 
1073	Producing the best possible work can only come through the prosperity of motivation and the willingness to do the work. 
1074	Being able to learn and retain knowledge, express themselves in countless ways, and want to actually complete the assignment are all reasons why student-designed projects prove to be more resourceful and efficient in the life of a typical student. 
1075	However, teacher-designed projects are helpful too, they teach exactly what the teacher would teach them in class which gives learners an understanding of the content from the teachers perspective and could possibly give them knowledge on material they do not know. 
1076	Learning is retaining, if the students do not retain any of the knowledge they are just trying to complete another teacher-given assignment, and they are not truly learning. 
1077	Drivers should not be able to use their cellphones while driving, for the reason that the use of a cell phone while operating a motor vehicle is exceedingly hazardous for the driver, as well as others who are traveling along the same road. 
1078	"The use of mobile devices while on the road leads to distracted driving which means that the driver is less likely to notice road and safety signals, Pedestrians and the signals coming from other vehicles. Failure to heed these signals has led to injuries and death that could have been prevented had the driver not been using a mobile device while on the wheel. In the U.S., there are laws banning the use of mobile devices or the act of texting while someone is on the wheel.  The National Safety Council reports that cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year. Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving. 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the U.S. is caused by texting and driving (""Texting and Driving Accident Statistics""). Cell phone distraction rates are alarmingly high and can pose serious safety risks. You can be charged with murder for texting and driving. Texting is the most alarming distraction sending or reading a text takes your eyes off the road for a couple of seconds. Using a cellphone while driving creates enormous potential for deaths and injuries on  U.S. roads. In 2017 alone 3,166 people were killed in motor vehicle crashes including distracted drivers. Texting and driving is against the law (""The Dangers of Distracted Driving""). "
1079	"In an effort to fight these problems, more than 30 states now have a law when it comes to texting and driving(""The Risks of Texting While Driving""). "
1080	The penalties for texting while driving could include hefty fines, license suspension, a rise in auto insurance rates, and prison time. The consequences you'll face for texting and driving are similar to those you'd get for another of the most serious driving offenses. (DUI) sometimes drivers who keep on texting do not see any people or animals crossing the street so there is a tendency to hit somebody crossing the road. Texting while driving is bad because it can bring fatal damages towards life. It may ruin the lives of others or worse might cause your life to end. Texting is a huge distraction to all drivers. Numerous drivers do not take this life threatening habit seriously and try to argue that these are an exception to these rules. 
1081	It may put you at greater risk because you fail to see important road signs and signals. Sometimes a stressful text can provoke anger, which might affect your driving behavior. Texting while driving is a horrible idea because you need to look at the phone as you type and read incoming text messages. The vehicle might run over hole or wrong rails which might lead to car accidents. Texting while driving is dangerous and does kill, and has many times. Using a cell phone particularly texting while driving requires the driver to turn his mental attention to the device manipulate it with his hand to look at it. 
1082	It makes sense because when you text and drive you are twenty three percent more likely to get into a car crash. That makes just as dangerous as driving under the influence. 
1083	It makes up eighteen percent of fatal car crashes. And more than 35 percent of teens and adults admit to texting and driving. So even though people know what could happen they still do it either way. And more then ninety percent of people know how dangerous texting and driving is. People take there eyes off the road for four seconds on average which is long enough for you to swerve on to another lane. And at least 9 people are killed every day by distracted drivers. 
1084	Schools that assign summer projects should give students the privilege to explore their interests, while encouraging creativity. Furthermore, schools that assign summer projects should allow students to design their own project because all students are under different circumstances and students should be allowed to be creative, especially in environments outside of school. 
1085	Each student should be able to incorporate the experiences of their summer break into their project, eliminating the regulatory aspect of a teacher-designed project. 
1086	For some students, regulation and routine can be exhausting. 
1087	Some may argue that student-designed projects are a bad idea because students need discipline and the possibility that the goal of continuous learning would not be achieved is greater. 
1088	This argument is false because discipline is not always effective 
1089	Guiding students down the right path while encouraging their own ideas is a more effective approach to helping students learn. 
1090	Simply giving students the freedom to design their own projects allows then to take advantage of their different circumstances and opportunities while implementing creativity. Assigning summer projects to assure students continue learning is an excellent idea, but allowing students to design their own projects may be more effective because all students are different. Anyone can complete a project with step-by-step instructions, but what matters is what is learned through the process. One set of explicit directions cannot satisfy every single students' needs and/or wants in a learning environment. In conclusion, the process of completing the project is more important than just getting it done. 
1091	As time progresses, so do classroom education and the technological innovations applied to it. While teachers search for helpful methods to engage their pupils in education, the world of science develops more and more inventions, such as the Facial Action Coding System, to improve standards of living 
1092	Despite its putative effectiveness in other fields such as advertisement or marketing, Facial Action Coding System technology possesses no place of value in a classroom and would serve as a hinderence to a student's learning process. 
1093	Although this software may serve as an effective source of profit for online corporations, it has no valueable place in classrooms. 
1094	"In the sixth paragraph of the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author illuminates the possibilites of success human-emotion-recognizing computer software provides in terms the world of marketing, describing how analyzing the emotional response to a Web ad popping up on one's computer screen can mold the variety of its future ads to a more preferred selection (6). "
1095	Verbal human communication is relied upon to determine what about a lesson plan confuses a student, and although a computer might register a student's confused expression and recognize that the lesson pace might be too fast for this individual scholar, the computer would be unable to pinpoint what exactly the student fails to understand. Other events may be weighing down heavily on a student's mind, causing their face to contort and convey the emotions brought on from factors outside of the learning setting. A change in emotion not caused by a difficult lesson plan would cause the software to possibly alter the lesson pace when the student did not require any adjustment and ultimately generate frustration in the already distressed student. 
1096	Although each day, more and more opportunities to develop and improve technology and learning are created, sometimes these brilliant innovations do not mesh well with education. Despite the proposed effectiveness this software can serve for marketing companies, Facial Action Coding System would only produce obstacles to a student's learning process, ultimately diminishing any value it could potentially possess in a classroom. 
1097	Because the projects are student designed, the students will feel a greater sense of responsibility for it, and will put more effort into it, which will up the quality of the projects. 
1098	When a student feels responsible for a project, they will go to greater lengths to ensure that they do it right, and that it turns out good.  No one wants something that is entirely their own to turn out bad.  The students will have greater creative liberty with how they execute it.  This flexibility will accomodate every student, no matter how they learn best.  Wether it be writing a paper, painting a picture, creating a diagram, or making a website, the students would be able to learn in whatever way they do best, no matter what that way may be.  Students will be better at ensuring that all details of the project are included.  If they are the ones to decide what the project includes, there is no way they can fall short of the information required.  Making it a student led project will allow the students to take a significant amount of pride in it, that does not come with other projects.  Having the students design their own projects would allow the students to try new styles of projects.  Perhaps the teachers they have do not assign a specific type of project that a student really enjoys.  The students would be able to do that type of project.  The students could also have the desire to try a new style of project.  The projects that are assigned at school can often be redundant or generally overdone.  Having the students design their own project will allow the students to try something new and possible adopt a preferred way of completing projects.  Having the students do the projects that they want to so will also help communicate to the teachers what the students want.  When a teacher sees a new and unique way of leaning, they could potentially use it in the future as a new and more captivating way of teaching. 
1099	This would give them an opportunity to research something that they don't already know anything about.  Often students cannot pursure their interests because of all their other responsibilities.  Many students cannot take the classes that they wish to take becuase they have other classes that they are required to complete in order to graduate.  Becuase there is no determined subject of the project, the students will have the rare chance to research whatever they want to.  This could even be a time where the students could learn something that is not taught in school at all. This also applies to classes that they may be taking that they do not do many projects in.  This would give them the chance to use and display the knowledge that they already have.  Similarly to the style of projects, upon seeing all of the topics that interest the students, the teachers may be inclined to add some of the topics to their curriculum, which would once again encourage the students to be more interested in their classes.  When one student is interested in something, it is more than likely that other students will be the same.  Though it is important for students to work with topics that are already somewhat familiar to them, it's also very important for students to step outside of their comfort zone into something entirely new.  When a student begins learning about a topic with an open mind and a goal to learn, they may find more than a project, they may find a passion.  It's very important to allow students to explore new interests while still in highschool.  Being in the smae routine for years may put a student into the mindset that they should not change what they are already doing, or it could even discourage students from pursuing new interests.  It is important that students find these interests so that they will have an idea of what they want to do when they go to college, or when they step out into the world as adults. 
1100	Students should be able to design their own projects, rather than teachers.  Student designed projects will push them to put more effort into in, to achieve some independence, and to generally care more about what they are learning.  Especially now days, the curriculum in more so about teaching what will be on the standardized tests that we must pass in order to graduate, rather that the interests that the students actually have.  The mindset that we must prepare students by not allowing them to pursue their own interests needs to stop.  We should strive to make learning more fun and cater the the interests of the students.  When students know what they enjoy, they will be more prepared for the future in which they will not be stuck doing a job that they do not enjoy, to live a life that has little interest to them.  One of the biggest issues right now with highschoolers is that they have no idea what they want to do with their future. 
1101	This is why and how dangerous Venus can be and how there condtions are extreme. Peopel would not risk dying to get some samples from Venus or try to go to  Venus. This why its not worth to study and analize samples of Venus and later on they can try to find better material or things to help out the space ship and humans to try to land or analize any samples from Venus. 
1102	some say that teacher-design is better and more effective 
1103	student-design actually can benefit the students more 
1104	by opening up their imagination and also expands their creativity. 
1105	Summer is mean't for fun and laughter, not being kept inside all day working on a project the teacher assigned over summer break. The whole point of summer is being away from school and having a vacation. So wouldn't students prefer to do a project about something that they are passionate about? Indeed, studies show that when students do school work that they choose and are passionate about their work ends up being more creative and overall better performance. Students are just growing up and in school they aren't allowed to truly express themselves because they are either too shy or the class doesn't discuss their interests. Teenagers only want to do and listen to what they want, they don't want a teacher giving them homework over summer break not even to mention that it is not something they enjoy. 
1106	students grow up doing what they are told by their parents and teachers. 
1107	students grow up with an endless imagination and one day eventually it dies when they grow up to become adults. That is why a student-design project can end up being more beneficial than supposed to having a teacher assign the students a project where they aren't going to have fun and in the end will probably forget what the project was about. Students learn better when they do something that interests them and benefit more from that then to do a project about the presidents.  Having a teacher-design project has minimal benefits, that is why having a student-design project, which opens up great minds and can help students comprehend better what they are learning when doing something they enjoy. 
1108	The final bell on the last day of school is a sound that is rejoiced by students and teachers alike. This bell is the signal to the beginning of summer break. While this break is usually filled with vacations, sporting events, and sleeping late, there is another key element that represents summer break for many students: the project. This project is incorporated into the summer break to assure that students continue learning. In many schools, this project is teacher-designed, resulting in uninterested and procrastinating students. In addition, many teacher-designed projects do not foster creativity. 
1109	These negative results of teacher-designed summer projects can be reversed by allowing student-designed projects. 
1110	Student-designed summer projects allow students to choose a topic that they are interested in, 
1111	be creative, 
1112	enjoy learning. 
1113	By allowing students to choose a topic that is compelling to them, they will be driven to complete the project with their best effort 
1114	Students will also have the option to choose a possible career path and research it throughout the summer. 
1115	"With their research and project, students can essentially ""test drive"" their intended career, instead of waiting until college to discover that they are completely uninterested in their major. For example, one student may desire to become an elementary school teacher. In her project, she decides to research how to become a teacher and the skills that the profession requires. After completing her research, she creates a binder of lesson plans that correspond with her state's standards of learning for her grade of choice. Consequently, she discovers that she truly has a passion for teaching and is reassured on her career choice through this student-designed summer project. The skills that she learned, including her lesson plans, can be used if/when she decides to become an elementary school teacher. While students are allowed to explore professional realms through student-designed summer projects, the possibilities are endless.  "
1116	When students have the option to be creative with their project, this captures the interest of many artistic students. 
1117	Teacher-designed projects are mostly straightforward, and have clear right and wrong answers. As a result, there is minimal room for creativity and originality. However, student-designed projects give students the ability to create an interesting and creative project, that captivates not only their attention, but the teachers that will evaluate it the next school year. For example, a student who is very creative may choose to design a project that showcases ways to use recycled materials in art. This project not only uses their artistic and creative abilities, but it also incorporates scientific and environmental strategies. 
1118	Student-designed projects allow students to enjoy learning 
1119	However, some teachers dislike student-designed projects since there is no clearly set standards or grading rubric, which results in a lengthy grading period. 
1120	While this can be true, teachers can create an overall rubric that addresses the key elements that each project must include, no matter the topic. 
1121	As a result, summer projects should be student-designed. This project style not only results in increased student involvement, but it also allows them to explore subjects that they may not have been able to otherwise. Student-designed projects also assist in the development of higher-level thinking, organizational skills, and responsibility skills; all of which are necessary in the professional world. Students are not only enjoying their topic, but they are also continuing to learn, which is the overall concept of summer projects. With student-designed projects, the possibilities are truly endless. 
1122	by limiting car usage it is possible to relieve stress 
1123	reduce pollution. 
1124	Limiting the use of cars can bring less stress to the everyday driver. 
1125	"When in a car, it is easy to see when the driver is stressed out. Stress accumulates with traffic jams or when someone is becoming infuriated by another driver, who is driving right in front of the other driver and going really slow. There are people who have seen there stress levels drop when they are not in or don't own a car. For instance, a community in Vauban, Germany, at least 70 percent of their residents don't own a car, while 57 percent sold their car to move there. A woman, Heidrun Walter, who is a resident there stated, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way""(Source 1). This verifies how people can get away from stress by just not having a car. In Bogota, Colombia, there is a day when automobiles are banned for a day, with the execption of buses and taxis. This day has become very popular, and is a ""good opportunity to take away stress""(Source 3), as said by Carlos Arturo Plaza, a business man who rode a two-seat bicycle with his wife on that day. On this day millions Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work, leaving the streets free of any traffic jam, when a driver gets stressed out he most, as stated in source 3. This shows the number of people who participated in this event and also shows their, less stressful, alternative modes of transportation. "
1126	Along with relieving stress, pollution will become less of a problem 
1127	"Cars are beneficial when it comes transportation, but they can cause harm to the environment as well. Pollution is a major problem in the today's world, and with the number of cars that are in use everyday it will only become worse. Smog or any other type of pollution can cause a city or even a country to take action. Such a Paris, Fance, who put a ban on driving to reduce pollution in their city, which rivaled Beijing, China, known as the one the most polluted cities in the world, as said in source 2. This strenghens the problems that cars pose on the world, these problems can lead to delivery companies losing money because the ban was put up and won't be lifted until the smog is gone. In addition, more information about car pollution can be found in source 1. There it talks about how cars are the ""linchpin"" of suburbs, and how they're ""a huge impediment to current efforts to drasticallly reduce greenhouse gas emissions."" In some places this is slowly resolving itself; places such as the United States have seen a drop in miles driven per person since it's peak in 2009. Sociologists believe that, ""it will have beneficial implications carbon emissions and the environment""(Source 4). This indicates that, while it is a major issue it is not impossible to solve it. "
1128	A butte and a mesa these are all natural things on our planet Earth. So why do you think that the planet Mars also can't have these things 
1129	"The writer claims that Venus is referred to as Earth's ""twin''. But the only evidence he gives to back up this claim is that ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of desnity and size."" "
1130	"but in reality, Earth and Venus are very differnet. Earth is much safer in terms of temperature, pressure, and gas compaired to Venus. Venus has a blanket of gas that covers it that is, ""almost 97 percent carbon dioxide."" Plus, on its surface, ""temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit."" with the level of carbon dioxide and the ragging heat that it has, nothing is safe for long on Venus, especially humans. He does state that several spacecrafts have attempted to land on Venus, and only lasted a few hours, but he doesnt state what happened to them. most people would guess that they just melted entirely because of the extreme heat, which is most likely what happened, but we don't know for sure. "
1131	"He also states that, ""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life."" But there is nothing that follows it that claims what happened or could have happened to cause high pressures, high temperatures, and a high level of carbon dioxide to form. "
1132	"But there could be more than what meets the eye. In parapgraph six, the writer says that,"" peering a Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions becuase most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere."" "
1133	With more details about what they are trying to find, it would be easier to evaluate whether or not the scientist efforts are really worth it, or just a waste of time. A planet that is inhabitable by humans or anything living is already a risk as is.       
1134	Most schools require students to complete a variety of projects during their summer break like reading books or completing a math packet. These projects help students continue their learning away from school, except the only difference is that they have all of summer to do it compared to having a due date within a week. Some projects prepare students for the upcoming school year while others act like reminders so that students won't forget what they learned in the past year. Though some believe that summer projects should be student-designed, others will argue that summer projects should be teacher-designed in order to get the best learning experience while away from school. 
1135	it will help students prepare for the upcoming school year. 
1136	Some students may panic because they won't understand the new material or that they will fall behind in the class because they don't remember how solve a simple question, but if teachers design a project based on their class, it gives students an idea of what to expect. For example, a student will be taking Algebra 2 in the upcoming school year, but doesn't know anything about the class. A simple teacher-designed project that could help a student is a packet with math problems from every unit with examples that explains how to do it, so when students go back to school, they aren't completely blindsided by the new concept. Most schools, mainly high school and middle school, have reading assignments that students must complete before the school year. Reading projects could range from reading a certain book and writing an essay about it to completing a reading bingo where students have to complete a series of reading tasks of their choosing. Yes, the word project seem bland and a complete waste of time while students are on their break, but it doesn't have to be boring as long as it serves the purpose of helping students learn. 
1137	I can personally say that teacher-designed summer projects help prepare students for the upcoming school year. Once in middle school, there was a reading project assigned during the summer where students had to pick a book of their choosing that they can connect to and make notes on the side. I decided to choose a book about sports because as an athlete, I could relate to bits of the story. There were a few new things from the book that I learned about, so I wrote little notes on the pages and highlighted the text. After completing the project and returning to school, the teacher then told the class that the purpose of the project was to prepare for annotations, a concept new to students, and to help understand how to compare books that would be read throughout the school year. 
1138	Over the summer, students would forget the material they learned from the past school year, which makes it hard for them to pick up once back at school. Students also learn at different rates meaning that some are more advanced than others. These are another few reasons as to why summer projects should be teacher-designed. 
1139	Teachers can design a project that helps them see where students are in their learning process and what they remember from past classes. 
1140	For example, if a student takes a language, like Spanish, teachers can design a project where students must write a story in Spanish based on a given prompt. The project could include requirements that were taught from previous classes with some new concepts added in to see if an individual knows new concepts that will be taught in their future class. This will help teachers understand how they can help a student and where they stand in their learning process. 
1141	Although these are valid reasons as to why summer projects should be teacher-designed, others will disagree and believe that summer projects should be student-designed. 
1142	The purpose of summer is so that students can take a break from all the stress that they have experienced during the school year, so a great way to learn and be stress free while doing so is a student-designed project. Students could be assigned a project for a class, but it could be of their choosing. For example, students could be assigned a project with no requirements where they have to make a presentation on anything that interests them, as long as there was a learning process. This will spark different ideas because all students have different backgrounds and their own interests like sports, cooking, or a job that they have. Though these topics are far from being similar, they all have a learning process. Since the project would be based on an individual's choice, it would be less stressful because it is something they are familiar with and know how to work around. 
1143	Yes, these are two very different sides with different opinions, but they both have a learning experience. Students still get the continuous learning process throughout their break while teachers can see where a student's learning capability is. Teacher-designed projects are stricter meaning that students would probably benefit from it more, while student-designed projects are less stressful based on a students choice. Even though most individuals would disagree saying that summer projects should be student-designed, teacher-designed projects are still the best option to get the best experience for learning new things and reviewing old material. 
1144	Many students would want to come up with their own thoughts on a summer project to have the motivation to complete the project, 
1145	make sure the topic they choose is interesting to them, and know exactly what their topic is about. 
1146	I think that if the projects are student-designed that they will be in involved and will have the courage to work on the projects they designed. 
1147	Also students that know their topic are going to be more aware. Student-designed projects are coming from the students therefore, students are going to know all aspects and components 
1148	"Not all students stay on track with projects however, if it's something they designed students can't say they were not aware of or ""didn't know what to do "
1149	As well as choosing something interesting to grade age kids. Most commonly students do not interact or don't want to interact with subjects or topics that don't interest them. 
1150	However since students would be the designers and come up wih all the thoughts and ideas, teachers would need to revise their project thoughts and make sure all project topics are project efficient. 
1151	Having students design and build onto their thoughts could save teachers from having to come up with ideas, help new ideas, and new flow from one another. 
1152	. If each student was to be part of a club at their school, they would be given access to pursue their hobbies with their classmates 
1153	This safe environment to pursue interests and hobbies would allow students to explore all kinds of activities and try to see which activities they would like to dedicate themselves too 
1154	By allowing students to figure out their interest they would be able to show off their uniqueness and add diversity to the school. 
1155	There are various reasons to mandate one extracurricular activity and the principal should have no problem enacting this idea. 
1156	By enacting this policy of having each student participate in an extracurricular activity, each student is given an opportunity to explore any pre-exsisting passions that they have. 
1157	If a student has had a passion ever since they were a little kid and know that they would like to join a club that builds on that, this policy would help do that. For example, if a student knew they wanted to be part of a club that helps them build on an interest of computer science they would be given the chance to join a club such as the Robotics team. They would be able to use their previous knowledge and joy for their topic, to elevate the team to greater success. If the school was able to bring a high number of dedicated students together to join clubs they would see vast improvements in the success of their activities. These students would be given even more motivation to join the club they love, bringing the best out of them and allow them to join clubs that they know they have interest in. Even though there are some students that know exactly what they want to do and want to dedicate all their time to one club, some students are not like that. Many students would like to explore various clubs and see which one is best for them, creating another reason to enact this policy. 
1158	With this policy students who are unsure of what their true passion is, will be more inclined to find which club they like and dedicate themselves to that. 
1159	Without this policy students who say they want to join clubs at their school are not motivated to act on what they said, instead choosing to go home and do nothing. Currently there are hundreds students in school that say they would like to join one of the various clubs offered, but find themselves simply riding the bus home and spending the rest of the day on their phone. This occurs due to a lack of motivation from anyone in school urging the students to join an extracurricular activity. Parents can only do so much for their kids when it comes to what their kids do in school, and some kids find ways to get out of joining any clubs. This is why schools need to put this policy in place to not allow their students talents go too waste. Not only would this policy help students explore interests they have, it would help everyone see how unique and diverse each person is. 
1160	If each student was doing at least one after-school activity students will be able to show their uniqueness and collectively create a diverse learning experience for everyone at school. 
1161	With every student participating in a club students would spread out amongst the various clubs offered at their school, creating groups of dedicated people who are trying to learn as much as possible to that topic. Currently schools face the problem of kids all gravitating towards the same clubs, such as Science Olympiad and Math Counts. If students don't get into these clubs or feel as though they aren't going to be able to do anything with these highly competitive clubs, they drop out and find themselves having nothing to do outside of school. Many students feel defeated and neglected after they don't do well in these clubs and find it hard to join any other club, for fear that the same tale may happen again. Because of this, hundreds of students intellectual abilities are being wasted. The current issue we face is a lack of students joining clubs after they are shunned away from another club, that is why we need the policy of at least one extracurricular activity per student. 
1162	 The problem we face with not having a policy of each student participating in at least one after-school activity, is that we have students who are immensely talented who are not motivated enough to be a part of a club. If the school was to have this policy every student would benefit from it as they are given a far greater reason to join a club. With the various advantages of creating this policy and minor drawbacks, each school should at least make an attempt to enact a policy that would not only help students but the school as a whole. With students having the added motivation to join the clubs offered at their schools, with the added diversity to the school, there is no reason a school should make an attempt to complete a policy like this. The principal at all schools should try to implement a policy that makes students participate in the after-school offerings that their school has.  
1163	It is very usual for school systems to assign students with a project over summer break. It is common for this project to be a long grueling book report or an assignment to research some far off place or historical happenstance that took place hundreds of years ago. These projects are often neglected by students till the end of summer due to them not enjoying or wanting to do the project 
1164	If they have the choice on the topic the students are more likely to enjoy the project. 
1165	Choosing the topic allows the student to truly express themselves and talk about something they enjoy. They won't feel as if they are being forced to do a topic they do not want to do. It will allow them to speak and explain something that they are passionate about. This will later help teachers learn more about what their students are interested in. If they are doing a project on something they enjoy it is likely they will put more effort into the project to make sure it is good work and not just some garbage quickly thrown together at the end of summer. 
1166	Given the ability to choose their own topic students are more likely to actually do the project. 
1167	They will have more motivation to do it because it can be on something they like. A lot of times teacher will get a lot of trashy work from students because they procrastinated the project all summer. The students will procrastinate the project till just a few days before school starts up because they do not enjoy the project topic. With the students given the ability to choose the topic there will be lowered procrastination in summer projects due to students enjoying the topic and wanting to do the work. 
1168	However, Students may still refrain from doing their projects. This is always true schools will always have some students who will not do their work especially summer projects. 
1169	But, schools will have a raise in student participation with the summer project if schools allow them choice of their own topic. Schools will notice students doing their summer projects that didnt do them the prior year when the topic was assigned. As well as letting the students choose their own topic schools are letting the students let their teacher know a little bit about themselves with whatever topic they choose. This allows the teachers to better understand their students before the year really kicks off. 
1170	Summer break is that time of the year where most students look forward to. Many are eager to sit back and relax, or enjoy their time with friends and family. Whatever it is, school is the last thing on their mind. It's the last thing on my mind too. Although that isn't always the case, there is always that one teacher that assigns projects over break. Summer projects are required through some schools to preserve their learning onto the next year. 
1171	To make it more enjoyable, I believe that these summer projects should at least be student-designed for various reasons. 
1172	Summer break is the time where most students proceed to pursue hobbies, enjoy lifes moments, spend time with people that are cared about, and make memorial memories. Over break, students tend to discover their true passions and focus on what drives their interest. With projects being assigned, that can be tough and build a wedge between the situation. If summer projects were to be student-designed however, students can make it more personalized and just have fun with it. I believe making the summer projects more personalized to students, can really ease the stress and make it more enjoyable. Overall, it is summer break. As a student myself, a time where this applied to me was in the summer of my freshman year. My teacher had assigned a summer project where we had to determine the area of different shapes in any form. Art is a huge passion of mine and I wanted to engage more of it into my summer. I decided to paint an abstract painting with a variety of shapes; circles, triangles, squares, you name it. It turned out beautiful, I really enjoyed spending my time on something that was educating and delightful. 
1173	Engaging learning with enjoyable hobbies can be beneficial for the teachers' satisfactory and the students.  
1174	For most people, finding hobbies that are interesting can be challenging. Knowing myself, I need a sense of direction to know what my interests. It takes a bit of courage to try something new and actually enjoy it. 
1175	Student designed school projects can really help a student find his/her passions and learn something new along the way. 
1176	Although students might think making school projects student-designed is a good idea, teachers might not agree. Some students could take this their advantage, by making the project as simple and pointless as they want. This could necessarily not reach the teachers standards and question if the student even learned anything at all. 
1177	Although this could be case, summer projects are indeed just summer projects and should not be taken seriously. Summer should be the time where students can have the choice of doing what they want. If projects are mandatory for teachers, then it can be arranged, but it shouldn't put unnecessary stress on students. Especially during summer break. Teachers should observe how well the student comes up with ideas and how well they execute their projects, it's more exciting that way. 
1178	Having being said, student designed projects are better for both the student and the teacher. It allows students to have more freedom and personalize their studies with their occupation. Teachers will also have the chance to determine the students personality and see what the student is like. It shows how bright a student's mind can be and how well their work ethics are. Teachers should give students a chance to show off themselves and appreciate for what they are able to achieve in. It can also be a fun learning experience for many. Not only will these student-designed projects continue their learning throughout break, it will also preserve any sort of creativity a student could withhold.            
1179	Well it's getting close to that time of year again, summer time! Warm air, bright shinning sun, and many activities that are only available during the summer season. But if you are like some students who go to certain schools maybe not so much. Some schools across the country require students to preform school based learning projects during their summer break. There projects are said to continue in helping kids and teens learn about subjects outside of school. Most of the projects are given by the teacher for the student to complete but some think that this decision should change. 
1180	What many teachers don't realize is that teenagers are slowly being thrown into adulthood. Every year we have seen more and more teenagers be pushed into adult responsibility even when they are so young. Many students have to get jobs in the summer to support their families and help them. Some students work on farms which require all hands on deck. Some students even have wives and children to take care of. 
1181	These students want the power this time and the choice to choose what they want to do. They want to be able to pick the subject that they are interested in and pursue it, this time with nothing and no one in their way. 
1182	Many students in the United States have been diagnosed with a learning disability. Whether is be reading, understand, or they just generally struggle to grasp a concept, these student have it hard. They are already given a disadvantage when they enter into the learning ring. Many of the students attend summer programs to assist them with their disabilities. Many teachers do not take this into account which leads to upset, angry, and stressed out students who truly can't help it. However, with them in control of these summer projects they could make something that conforms to them. 
1183	The project, with them behind the learning wheel, could also assist them with their disability. 
1184	They could make it something they understand and can learn at their own pace while also learning about something they enjoy. They can finally be set free and be given the power and choice to learn a pursuing subject, but also have something that conforms to their personal needs. 
1185	Students as a word is something that a lot of people see as a word used to describe kids and teens who go to school, learn, then return to perfect homes. That might have been the case year ago, but not anymore. In today's society kids and teens are being pushed to take responsibility. They are being pushed to work and survive without guidance from parental figures. The idea of the over the summer projects is neat, but if they are truly going to work then the students should be in control. Getting a choice and a say so in the matter is what may students long for and want, because they may have never had it before. They get to choose and pursue something they may have always dreamed of and want to chase after. With nothing holding them back except their drive and imaginations, these students will finally have a choice to follow their dreams to something much bigger. 
1186	Every living thing on planet earth has emotions. These emotions have been used since the beginning of time to express the feelings of the people around you. However, these emotions can be decieving. Someone could say they are happy, when really they are angry or upset. This is where the Facial Action Coding System comes into play. The FACS is a software that detects human emotion by tracking muscles in the face. For example, when you are happy, muscles in your face move up, and when you are sad, they move down, FACS tracks this and calculates your emotions. The creators of this software, Prof. Thomas Huang and Prof. Nicu Sebe are the leading experts of developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate. There are still some questions surrounding the usefulness of FACS, like what could this software actually be used for? One of the ways FACS may be used is in classrooms. 
1187	It may sound far fetched, but actually, FACS may be the best thing to come to schools 
1188	flexible learning 
1189	the ability to read the students. 
1190	"In the education world, teachers are the backbone of the infestructure. Without teachers, the whole system would collapse. However, it may be hard for one teacher to connect with every student individually and make sure they are learning properly or if they are paying attention. This is where FACS comes in. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"", Dr. Huang talks about FACS in classrooms more in depth, ""'A classroom computer could recgonize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts. 'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human istructor.'"" "
1191	With FACS, every child could essentially have a customized lesson plan exactly for their needs. This would make children more eager to learn because they begin to enjoy it. 
1192	It is very hard for anyone to tell someone they are sad. This is especally true when they barely know the person they are talking to. This can be the case for school councelors and the children they are meeting with. FACS may be able to help. 
1193	With FACS, the school could see if children are upset or scared. 
1194	The school could also see how often these children feel this way. When a child is unhappy or scared, it is very unlikely that they are going to be doing their work at full capacity. If FACS could find these children that need help, they could be helped faster. This could also be used to find children being bullied. If the child is feeling scared around another student, or if a child is afraid of a classroom, they could be helped because FACS was able to read them. FACS may even be able to detect if a child is afraid of leaving school. With FACS, it's like every child in school has someone that is looking out for them, even if no one else is 
1195	With the constant evoultion of the way we learn, its not suprising that something like FACS was created. Emotions have been with everything living since the beginning of time. Before FACS, it was suprisingly difficult to read these emotions in people. Such a crucial part of our everyday lives could be easily hidden away by a fake smile or a theatre tear. But now that there is FACS helping out, looks are no longer decieving.

You know your dad and i used to do it when we were younger, and when you were little you always talked about how you wanted to be a runner like me when you got older. Just try it, and if you really don't like it, i'll go talk to your principal about the requirement,"" her mom offers. ""I don't know,"" Generic_Name contemplates. ""Think about all of the great opportunities and things that could come out of this!"" Generic_Name's mom says positively. ""Please?"" her mom tries one last time. Generic_Name sighs. ""I guess,"" she finally agrees. "
1198	Forced extracurricular activities will benefit students in many ways, especially by motivating ones that do not typically do activities 
1199	helps them to build new friendships 
1200	and gives them the opportunity to try new things.  
1201	Balance is one thing that is very important, especially when it comes to middle and high school; colleges look at whether a student can manage an activity with all of the school work as a big factor in the admissions process. For example, My older sister applied to UVA last year; She had straight A's, a great GPA and SAT score, but got denied because she wasn't a balanced student. She claims that if she would have had a required extracurricular activity, she would have had a better high school experience because it would force her to have a little more fun, which she needed at the time.  Another example of the lack of balance is that my older brother comes home stressed and angry everyday because he's so determined about keeping his grades up in high school. His favorite sport used to be football, until his classes started getting harder and he stopped playing. However, next year he is going to step down from one of his hard classes, so he can play football again and still keep his grades up; therefore, he will regain his much needed balance again. If our school continues to require these extracurricular activities, it will prepare students for high school by showing them that they need to have a balanced school-work life to both mentally and physically succeed.  
1202	The next reason our school should continue to require extracurricular activities is because it helps students build new friendships. 
1203	It is very important to have good friends throughout middle school and high school because you will need people to talk to about things, support you in situations. and even just to share laughter and spend time with that aren't your family. For example, when i started middle school my parents made me try out for track, which i really didn't want to do. After a few days, i had made so many great friends that i could not only hang out with at practice, but i also then knew them at school. To this day, i am even better friends with those people, therefore, i can't imagine what my life would be like if i hadn't tried out for track. Another example is my older brother made his closest friends, Generic_Name and Generic_Name, in football when he first started high school. Before that, he didn't have many good friends; football really changed his life in that way, for i never see him happier than when he is with them. 
1204	The final reason our school should continue to require extracurricular activities is because it gives students the opportunity to try new things. 
1205	If you aren't required to do something, most of the time you probably won't do it unless it interests you; however if you are required to do something, you will be forced to do it no matter what, but you might surprise yourself, and find interest in that thing after all. Like mentioned previously, my parents made me try out for track when i first started middle school. At first, i wasn't the biggest fan of the idea, but i decided to give it a try; i ended up surprising myself, and Absolutely loved it. I was one of the best sprinters on my team, and found running to be a great way to release my negative energy from the day. Another example of this is my friend Generic_Name; she had no interest in sewing at all, but her mom forced her to try the sewing club at her school. Vivian ended up really enjoying it, and found it very therapeutic, as it was a great way to let out her stresses from the school day. 
1206	students will get to connect with others who have their same interests, 
1207	Students get to meet kids that they normally wouldn't meet just in school, 
1208	students will get an example on what it is like to work with a team or group. 
1209	it is good for students to participate in one extracurricular activity because students will get to connect with others who have their same interests. 
1210	People that have your same interests are different than people that you hang out in school.  You hang out with people in school because they have the personality that you enjoy to hang out with.  But, people with the your interests will understand you better and you will always have something to talk about.  The people in your group will talk about the same things that you do.  For example, a student wants to join the soccer team, and he doesn't know anyone.  The student can is always able to talk to his teammates about soccer because they are on the same team.  Then eventually, the student will no longer have to only talk about soccer because he has finally fit in to the rest of the kids.  Finally, the kids that have the same interests as you will also be the people that you will talk to the most in or outside of school because you like to talk to them about your sport or group. 
1211	, it would be good for students to do an extracurricular activity because they will get to meet people that they normally wouldn't meet when you are in school. 
1212	"Joining a team or group will be nerve racking at first because you might not know anyone that share the same interests as you do.  But when the team/group finally gets to talking, they will have bonded so that nobody could break them apart.  It is important to get those types of relationships because if you ever need help to do something, then your team/group will have your back no matter what the problem is.  In school, you choose who your friends are, and once you have your group, nobody else is allowed in.  But when you join one a sports team, the student council, or the yearbook staff, then you set aside your school friends and you allow yourself to gain different friends.  People that you once thought were ""weird"", or ""annoying,"" are now your friends because you realized that they actually have the same personality that you do. "
1213	it is important to do at least one extracurricular activity because students will get a taste of the real world in having to work as a team to get things done. 
1214	If students don't get the opportunity to work with a group, and to work as a team, then they wouldn't be prepared for life when they are older.  Learning to work with people is one of the most important things you need to know how to do.  So the sooner that you start, the better the future that you will have.  If you don't know how to work with people, then the path that is in front of you is rough because nobody will want to hire you, nobody will want to work with you, and nobody will have sympathy for you.  Nobody will hire you because they will look at your back round and see nothing in you that will help them in their work space.  Nobody will want to work with you because you will be mean and do little to no work.  Finally, nobody will have sympathy for you because they know that you had every chance to be successful, but you chose not to be.  Most people don't want that, do you? 
1215	Have you ever wondered how someone close to you was feeling, at any moment of the day? This new Facial Action Coding System can help you do exactly that. The system will be useful in many ways, but I think it can be very useful in the everyday classroom. 
1216	Teachers have always wondered how their students were feeling at all times during their lesson, and this software can help them reach out to their students tremendously 
1217	their attitude 
1218	their teaching style 
1219	"Imagine being a teacher and being able to read the students' faces an emotions. In paragraph 6, it states that ""the software can recognize when a student is becoming bored or confused."" This can allow teachers to analyze the situation in which the classroom is in. If the students are generally happy, then you can go along teaching and educating them the same way as you did before. Now, what if the students were not so enthused about your lectures? If the students show a monotone facial expression, or maybe a bored and sad one, then it might be due time to go and fix your mistakes, make the plan more exciting, and get them excited about learning. This can improve their confidence and allow them to have a bright future. "
1220	If the teachers can read their expressions, change their lesson plan, and create a greatly improved learning environment, then everyone can go home happy. 
1221	If the student is showing signs of negative facial expressions and emotions, then the teacher can alter their style of teaching. 
1222	They can create a warm and fun learning environment for the pupils, which can lead to them successfully gaining the knowledge they need to move on in life. The way a student acts in the classroom can affect many others around them and their attitude towards learning. If a teacher can detect even the slightest bit of negativity in the classroom, they can stop the spread and do their best to make learning fun and relatable for the students. 
1223	"This new software could be innovative for the way classrooms work in the future. If students could be educated the way they would want to be educated, yet still get the knowledge they need to succeed, then the future generation could be unstoppable. In paragraph 9 it states that ""making faces can reveal so much about the science of emotions."" There are no limits to what the next generation can do if it all starts with teachers being able to read the emotions of their students. The future starts here with this idea, and this software. "
1224	Ever been rushed around? Have had so much to do in so little time? What if you had to do a extra activity on top of that? Would your life be hectic? 
1225	Time. 24 hours a day. Students spend seven through 8 hours a day at school. Should be getting at least eight hours of sleep. This is leaving on eights hours to do homework, chores, ride or walk home, and spend time with family. If you add an extra activity this will take away from time at home. Some of the activities are fished late at night or are held in a place far away so it will take awhile to get home. This makes doing homework hard or even sleeping hard. If a student comes to school sleep it will make the work that they are doing decrease. When this happens the grades will drop slowly but surely. When they see that there grade has dropped this makes them upset and stressed. Creating this viscous cycle 
1226	Forcing kids to do after and during school activities will make free time vanish into thin air. 
1227	buses are the way students get to and from school. People who live far and close can take a bus. Even walk. If someone stays after school there is no bus to take them home. The either have to walk or find a ride. Some parents are busy or can't pick them up. What do you do about this? Giving a bus to take one or two kids home wouldn't make sense. If you do this option it will take awhile to find someone to do it or to find out if the kid has permeation from the parents. 
1228	If you give students the choice to do things after school they can figure out if they need a ride or if they do not need a ride. 
1229	Sols, testing, homework, grades, home life, drama, and family. All of these things are stressful. Life moves by so mast. Stress comes in and out of our lives all of the time. That is normal for humans. Even if we don't have stress in our lives homework and testing can just make you stressed. 
1230	Summer projects have long been a popular way to ensure that students continue learning during their break. Ranging across subjects, summer assignments encompass everything from math packets to reading lists to art projects. These assignments can be either teacher- or student-designed -- two different styles of learning, but both with the goal of preparing for the upcoming year. Teacher-designed projects often focus on important information for the class and student-designed projects often focus on exploring their interests. 
1231	While teacher-designed summer projects don't necessarily allow students to learn about what interests them, they give students the best preparation for the class ahead 
1232	by emphasizing crucial topics 
1233	showing how the class will operate. 
1234	Teacher-designed summer projects prepare students for the course by ensuring that they know important background information that will help them succeed later in the year. 
1235	For example, every summer, the math department at my high school posts review packets for each class; these packets are made and edited by the teachers each year and include what they have found to be the most crucial topics for students to understand in order to succeed in their classes. The teachers' experience and expertise make the packets beneficial for students, as all of the information they have selected is considered to be vital. This allows students to be fully prepared for the course, because if they understand all of the background information in the packet, then they have all the tools they need to learn and understand new material later in the year. It also ensures that students do not forget any information they learned in the previous year, or, if they did forget it, that they relearn it. In contrast, if students tried to design their own summer packet, they may waste time reviewing unimportant topics and completely ignore more crucial ones, leaving them ill-prepared for the year ahead. 
1236	Additionally, teacher-designed summer projects give students a glimpse of how the class will operate, allowing them to realize the tools needed to learn effectively 
1237	When teachers are able to create their own summer projects, they can show students the types of assignments that they will see in class, giving the students ample time to understand and adapt to the teacher's standards. They allow students to not only learn new information, but also new strategies and techniques that will help them succeed during the school year. For example, my friend who attends a neighboring high school had a summer assignment from her AP Language teacher, while I had none. She was able to learn all of the rhetorical techniques her teacher wanted her know, as well as how to approach that level of work, over the summer, leaving her well-prepared for the class when it started. I, however, faced a steep learning curve at the start of the year as I tried to figure out my AP Lang assignments while also trying to keep up with all my other schoolwork. Comparatively, my friend had a much eaiser time than I did because she already knew the neccessary skills, having learned it all over the summer. Therefore, teacher-designed summer projects allow students to see how their classes will operate during the school year and respond accordingly, giving them an easier, more prepared start to the year. 
1238	Despite these positives, some might argue that teacher-designed summer projects do not allow students to explore and learn about their own interests; 
1239	Teacher-designed summer assignments can be open-ended, allowing students to explore their interests within the confines of a certain theme or structure. 
1240	For example, AP Studio Art students at my high school are required to create a portfolio over the summer with a set number of pieces about the same idea, but they can use any medium they wish, allowing them to express their individual personality and ability. So, while they have to meet certain requirements, they are free to explore new mediums and techniques, as well as showcase their creativity and character. Additionally, teachers can use summer projects as a type of diagnostic, allowing them to assess a class's abilities. If teachers find that the class has a strong grasp on certain skills, then they may be more inclined to allow more student-driven projects during the year. This would allow students to pursue their own interests later in the year, even if they did not have that opportunity over the summer. Teacher-designed summer projects do allow students to learn about what interests them, as long as certain requirements are met. 
1241	In the end, teacher-designed summer projects best prepare students for the upcoming year by ensuring that students posses crucial background information and by allowing them to understand the class requirements and operation beforehand. Teachers hold the most experience, making them the best candidates to show students the tools needed to succeed in their class. Additionally, they have the ability to give students a glimpse of their class, allowing them to learn the necessary information as well as adapt to the teacher's standards and practices. These opportunites combine to ensure that students are well-prepared for the year ahead, as they have been able to learn what they need to over the summer. Students are then able to start the school year off right, possessing the knowledge and skills required to learn effectively. 
1242	Why should the creativity of students be suppressed when they have to complete an assignment or project? Summer break is a time of rest and relaxation for kids who work hard to during the school year; consequently, it's inevitable that students will forgot information they have learned since they are not typically using their brain power while relaxing. To avoid this problem, summer projects are assigned to keep the minds of the students active and to prepare them for the next school year. Obviously, many students struggle with these projects because they are required to follow uninteresting, hard to understand guidelines set by the teachers 
1243	Teacher-designed projects discourage students from working in such a way that benefits them since they must follow a rubric that limits them. 
1244	"That rubric does not give students an opportunity to work in such a way that is unique to them because the rubric requires perfect, ""textbook"" solutions. Also, teacher-designed projects are often confusing and may require thinking that is outlandish, or too difficult to understand. This further proves that projects not created by students aren't beneficial because some students can't grasp onto certain concepts or thinking processes different from the ones they have previously been using. "
1245	some may still agree with assigning students teacher-based projects over the summer because everyone receives the same assignment, therefore the level of difficulty is the same for everyone. 
1246	However, they are incorrect because everyone is unique, has their own way of understanding certain situations, and solves problems in different ways. 
1247	When you are given the opportunity to freely express yourself, it will most likely give you incentive to complete it. This directly connects to allowing students to create their own summer projects because giving students the opportunity to explore something that interests them creates motivation. In addition to that, student-designed projects will ultimately lead to better grades. Having motivation to complete something will make you put more effort into the assignment. 
1248	some people may continue to insist that teacher-designed projects lead to better scores because students can receive easily help due to the criteria made specifically for the project 
1249	However, they are wrong because student-designed projects are more beneficial to grades because they make students more motivated, and motivation leads to more effort placed into the project. 
1250	students are more motivated to do better on assignments they create and they are able to work in such a way that helps them succeed. It's important to realize that students are not perfect and do not think in the same way that someone else might. Teacher-designed summer projects are not used to ensure that students are trying their best; instead, they are only used to make sure students are doing something that makes their brain work, even if they don't understand it. Repeatedly working on something that you can not comprehend is useless and is not beneficial. We know that the true goal of summer projects is to prepare students for the next school year. If you want students to be prepared, then give them something they not only understand, but enjoy as well.  
1251	"In paris they banned cars for a little will because of the pollution making smog. Any one found driving would be fined. Almost 4000 people were fined for driving on that monday and 27 people has their cars impounded for thier reaction. After 5 days the the smog started to leave and they could see beijing, china which are the most polluted citys in the world. In france 67 percent of cars are diesel.  In colombia on car free day people kiked, biked, skated or took the bus on car free day. It was the third start year they had to ban cars to reduce all the smog and people who didnt listen had to pay 25 dollar fine. For the first time other places joined the event to help with the pollution."" These people are generating a revolutionary change, and this is crossing borders,"".  "
1252	"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author argues the point that exploring Venus is worth the effort and risks exhibited. The author claims that, despite the harsh conditions and deadly atmosphere, this planet is worth travelling to and observing, due to its being the ""nearest option for a planetary visit"". "
1253	"While the author does list a few good reasons for Venus exploration, it is my belief that they also include many reasons not to explore this dangerous planet. This inclusion of the ""cons"" of exploration hurts the thesis more than it helps it, and damages the authors argument. "
1254	"From the beginning of their argument, the author states that ""no spacecraft survived the landing [on Venus] for more than a few hours"" and that ""not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades"". "
1255	The usage of these statements creates a negative image, which can lead readers to believe that the exploration of Venus is too dangerous to enagage in. 
1256	"Furthermore, the author uses facts intended to continue to convince readers that Venus is dangerous, when this is exactly the opposite of what the author is arguing for. Making statements which invoke fear or apprehension only pushes the reader away from the topic, instead of influencing him or her to gain interest in it. For instance, when the author uses phrases with negative connotations, such as ""thick atmosphere"", ""corosive sulfuric acid"", ""800 degrees Fahrenheit"", and ""extreme"", they influence readers negatively as well.  "
1257	Similarly, the author provides little reasoning behind the belief that humanity should explore the planet Venus. 
1258	"Despite claiming that ""Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit"", there is little evidence given that exploring and observing Venus would be of much benefit. In fact, the author seems to have found more evidence against Venus exploration, as the prior paragraph (which listed reasons that Venus was dangerous) was much more explicit and detailed than paragraph 3. The negatives of exploring Venus (such as death and wasted money or time) seem to far outweigh the positives. "
1259	As the author continues with their argument, readers become increasingly aware that Venus is likely not as beneficial as the author intends to make it seem. With an unlivable biome and dangerous atmospheric conditions, Venus is likely far too hazardous to explore at this time in history, and I believe that the author of this article unwittingly proved so. For these reasons, I believe that the author of this article failed to support their thesis with thorough evidence or detail.       
1260	During the summer many students tend to loose the skills and information they gather through the previous school year. Some higher level courses to prevent this problem, implement summer reading activities or online module/guided programs to keep their students on top of the material or to refresh them... but with all schools come different teaching styles. Some teachers strive for their students to be more independent and do the work on their own, but other teachers like to have a rigorous and set rubric or outline of what projects and essays should look like. 
1261	Students, or anyone, only grow and develop when they're exposed to challenges and obstacles it builds their mental capacity and their problem solving skills. If a teacher choices to do a particularly hard project or assignment this pushes the students out of their comfort zone allowing them to make these new connections in their brain and gain new knowledge and working skills. But if a kid is allowed to design their own project for the summer, most kids aren't going to do an extravagant or hard project, but instead take a more simplistic and easier way because the students want to enjoy their summer and not waste it on a school project. This would be a detriment to the students academics and the skills they could've acquired if they were to apply themselves. 
1262	"Tim Ryan, an experienced bird watcher once said, ""In middle school, somebody started the weirdest club imaginable... a bird watching club. Being the class clown that I was, my friends and I signed up for the oddest club at school. At first, it was just funny. Then I found myself looking forward to club day. Bird watching was a ton of fun. If I wasn't required to sign up for a club, I would never have found my true passion -- bird watching."" School required extracurricular activities have been controversial for many years. Is it a waste of time? Are the activities even fun? As the years went by, many people started to realize that extracurricular activities are beneficial "
1263	it can boost their confidence, 
1264	improve their time management skills, 
1265	teach them how to work with other people, 
1266	they may even find a new favorite hobby. 
1267	According to a survey conducted by the Activity Observation Committee, 76% of all Generic_City students have found a new, beloved activity that was introduced to them during school. Some people have the courage to attempt a new activity on their own time, but others aren't so lucky. You may think you don't like to do something, but you truly don't know until you try it. Your future won't be resting on that activity. If you like it, then that's amazing. If not, then there is nothing to worry about. You will have tried it and then your source of dislike would be valid. 
1268	"Generic_Name, a sixth grader from Generic_School, once said, ""I never actually thought that I would be good at a sport. However, all of my friends are good at basketball. When club time rolled around at school, I got pressured into joining the basketball club with them. It turns out that times have changed. I'm pretty good at basketball. I've been feeling much better about myself knowing that I'm good at something."" By requiring students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity, Generic_Name found that she was really good at basketball. A talent could be hidden under your surface. By signing up for a club, it can unearth that special talent. Some students may acknowledge this but are too afraid to try something new. By requiring students to sign up for an activity, the have to take that risk. "
1269	Generic_Name is a part of his high school's student council. Part of his job is to work with others to cultivate ideas for school programs. The council has taught him the importance of expressing his opinions and ideas. The council has made Evan much more confident about his opinions and now expresses them throughout daily life. A student council is not the only activity that can boost your communication skills. Those skills will increase anywhere that you are working together, which is usually any activity. By improving your communication skills, you are preparing for the future. You will need to be able to have excellent communication skills during college, work, and just daily life. In addition, you could make many friends. According to the Brain Like Mindedness Observation Assessments, people with the same interests typically make better friends. A club is just a bunch of people gathered together doing an activity that they enjoy. There are plenty of chances to make a friend. So next time nobody wants to join a club with you, don't worry. Once you get there you will make many friends. 
1270	On the other hand, some people claim that extracurricular activities are just a waste of time. 
1271	The only way that participating in an extracurricular activity could be a waste of time is if you aren't managing your time efficiently. 
1272	A study conducted by the Time Management Association showed that 87% of all students that are in extracurricular activities have started to use a calendar or agenda to plan their time. Using your time wisely can be very beneficial when you have many things to get done. It can also help with not procrastinating. By knowing what has to be done and when it has to be done, you are more likely to actually do that work. This will help you prepare for what will come in the future. Your whole life will need to be planned out: when to get groceries, what needs to be done at work, when to go to the dentist, or even when to pick up a child from school. Whatever the scenario is, it is crucial to manage your time wisely. Life can get chaotic and it is important to know how to handle the chaos. 
1273	Ultimately, participating in extracurricular activities is a very beneficial from a young age. These activities can boost confidence, teach people how to work together, and improve time management skills. So, next time you have the opportunity to try a new sport or activity, go for it! You have nothing to lose and a lot to gain. Suggest clubs and activities to friends and family members. It is important to involve not only yourself, but others too. Remember Tim, the professional bird watcher? If he had never took the risk of participating in the bird watching club at his school, he would never have been discovered his true passion of bird watching. Maybe one day you will be like Tim and participate in an extracurricular activity. You never know... it could shape your future for the better. 
1274	Summer projects are done by many students and are used by schools to assure learning over the break. Summer projects are usually assigned by teachers or by the school so they know what and how the student is doing academically over the summer. Most of the time, students find the summer projects annoying and a nuissance to their break and, thus, do the project later in the summer rather than doing gadually over summer. 
1275	To fix this, students should be able to design what they are doing 
1276	Having the student design the project they are doing assure that the student wants to complete the project. 
1277	A student designed project would allow the student to accomplish what they want. For example, if a teacher gave a student a summer project to do over the summer and the student does not like the project, the student would not be inclined to do the project. However, if the student had designed the project, the student would be more inclined to do it since the student would know what exactly they can and cannot do. The student would also be more excited to do the project and thus complete it. Since the student would want to complete project, they would probably retain the information better. 
1278	A student designed project would allow the student to be more creative with their learning process and with the finished product in general 
1279	Since letting the students design the project means for freedom, the student could become more creative with what they accomplish. For example, if the student designed a book project, they could make the project a video project or a visual arts project or something that would be entertaining rather than a project like a book summary or a relationship between two things. With more creativity, students get to explore more with the topic and relate the topic to something they personally like. 
1280	With a teacher designed project, the students would not get that much control over what they learn and would feel dependent on the teacher and not feel ready for the outside world. With a student designed project, the students get to choose what is important to their education and what they need to remember over the summer. The students would also feel a sense of independece from the mostly teacher-based education they normally get. This control and independence would also let the student become prouder of their accomplishment and the finished product. 
1281	With the opportunity to be more creative, in control, and independent, student designed projects over the summer would be a great idea for continued learning outside of the classroom. With that opportunity, students would feel a sense of freedom and a sense control over what they are doing. Student designed projects would allow an opportunity for self based learning outside of the classroom. 
1282	Having students participate in at least one extracurricular activity allows them to socialize with students, participate in activities they enjoy or even find something new to try. 
1283	When students do outdoor activities or school activities it can help them keep things off their minds like, problems at home,in school or in certain places outside. 
1284	Dissenters of the idea claim to say that limiting car usage will negatively impact the car industry, 
1285	"Limiting car usage doesn't mean that people will have to stop buying cars; it simply means that they will have to find a different method of transporation. Source 2 says that in Paris on certain days motorist, who had an odd or even license plate number, had to leave their cars at home and find an alternative method of transportation. Does the evidence demonstrate an impact to car companies? Did they have a financial deficit due to their lack of buyers? The answer is simple: no, because they didn't ban the use of cars. Also, car companies can well benefit from places that limit car usage but allow hybrid cars; this allows for an increase in revenue. Most car companies in today's society model hybrid cars that run on primarily electricity and gas. In Paris, they made exceptions ""for plug-in cars, hybrids, and cars carrying three or more passengers (Source 2)"". These exceptions actually promote the buying of hybrid cars! This will boost the economic profit of the car companies, not damage it. "
1286	Limiting car usage does not affect car companies, but instead supports it. 
1287	The limitation of car usage betters the environment. 
1288	"Cars emit greenhouse gases in the atmosphere faster than they can be removed. This causes health problems in living organisms and pollution of ecosystems. Cars are liable for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and 50 percent in areas in the U.S. as Source 1 states. People are playing with the balance of nature and if its not fixed then humans are as good as dead; this is why the implementation of limiting car usage benefits people. The effects of this can be seen in Bogota, Colombia, whose goal is to reduce smog and promote alternative transporation (Source 3), and Paris, where intense smog covered the enitre city: ""The smog rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world.(Source 2)"" The source explains that cold nights and warm days trapped in car emissions and after a few days of reducing car usage the air cleared up. This shows the effectiveness of the limiations of car usage. "
1289	The limiting of cars also boosts community wellness. 
1290	"The people who experienced this regulation had positive views on the matter and even on rainy days they participated! Bogota, Colombia has gone into its third year of banning cars and the turnouts of the pariticipation were large, with two other Colombian cities joining and municipal authorities from other countries to view the event (Source 3). The evidence show that limiting cars wasn't opposed by the people, in fact, other countries were wanting to get in on the action. This limiting of car usage really cuts down on traffic congestion and new community projects have been established to ease the transition to alternative transportation. Heidrun Walter, mentioned in Source 1, syas that when she had her car she always tense and stressed and is happy with the change. The source also mentions that the ""swish of bicycles and the chatter of wandering children drown out the occasional distant motor (Source 1)."" This shows that the limitation of car usage greatly enchances the wellness of the community and promotes a safe and stress-free environment for the people. "
1291	"Slip into a world where emotions are easily read. There could be no mind games, no pettiness, and no suffering in silence;this could be the new reality. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto, he introduces a new concept created by Thomas Haung:Facial Action Coding System software. This programming system allows computers to register all of the emotions on an individual's face, reguardless if they are mixed. "
1292	Thomas Haung's new software would not only find useages in a classroom, but also in daily life. 
1293	"Granting teacher's access to their student's feelings could give teacher's insight on how well their concept's are grasping. To further prove the computer's effectiveness, Huang states, ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor,"" (D'Alto). In addition to assisting a classroom setting, enabling people to read other's emotions would be benefitial also. Reading into surroundings helps people grow. Knowing what feelings an individual possesses could compell someone to be more considerate or act accordingly to how that individual feels. With that in mind, this program could also strengthen relationships "
1294	Although the Facial Coding Acting System invades privacy, lessons human interaction, and may not be completely accurate of human emotions, it ultimately serves to benefit. 
1295	While privacy concerns are understandable, the possible results after the slight invasion could be more than worth it. An unfortunate day could be quickly turned around if people were aware of the circumstances. Without a situation being addressed, nothing can be fixed;the same goes for a person's emotional state. 
1296	However, on the technological aspect, how can one know how reliable a computer is on detecting somebody's facial expression? 
1297	"Dr. Huang also explains that ""the facial expressions for each emotion are universal"" reguardless of the desgree of expression, (D'Alto). Finally, the fear of more computer based activities is rapidly squashed by the contradiction that being more aware should envoke more human interaction, not lesson it. "
1298	Initially, the thought of additional advancement of technology is frightening. Predicting ideas is not always a sure way of indicating what will occur. However, after Dr. Huang introduces and explains his new concept of Facial Action Coding System Technology, it is arduous to reject the placement of this software into everyday life. Hopefully, the program will be installed soon so it can start making improvements in various industries across the board. 
1299	Summer projects are a great way for students to stay sharp during their long hiatus from school. The summer should be a time for students to relax and explore their passions without having to worry about schoolwork too much. But they should still have a few projects to do over the break so when they get back to school in Autumn, teachers don't waste time reviewing material their students have already learned 
1300	 Teachers should design summer projects so they can follow their curriculum as close as they want 
1301	If the projects were designed by students, they might not cover what the teacher intended to cover. In fifth grade, my teacher told us to do a project on whatever we wanted. The only guideline was that we had to present our findings to the class in some way. The variety of the projects was immense. However, this did not bother my teacher because her goal was to get us used to doing research projects before we went to middle school. While it may have seemed as if we, the students, were designing out own project, we were really doing the teacher designed project of practicing research. Another time, in tenth grade chemistry, our teacher told us for the end of year project to do whatever we wanted. She never specified that it had to relate to chemistry, even though it was implied. So when it came time to present our projects, a group of boys went up to the front of the class and started explaining the rules of spikeball. When asked what spikeball had to do with chemistry they said they did not know the project had to be related to chemistry. Confusion like this is easily caused when the teacher does not design the project and leaves it up to the students. That is why if the teacher wants to stick to their curriculum, they should be in charge of designing summer projects, not students. 
1302	Summer projects should be a way for students to get used to the type of work they will be doing with a certain teacher in the future 
1303	If the students design their own projects, they will not be introduced to their teachers style of assessment until the beginning of the year and will have a harder time on the first few assignments in that class. My ninth grade history teacher was very different compared to any teacher I had before. The first project he assigned was very tricky and I did not really know what to do. I ended getting a bad grade on it but I eventually got used to his project style later on in the year. If he had given us a project designed by him over the summer I would have been more prepared for the first real projects of the year. On the other hand, my ninth grade English teacher gave us a summer reading project of her own creation that really helped at the beginning of the year. By completing that assignment, I was prepared for the year because the reading got me used to the workload of the class, and the project got me ready for future similar reading projects that we did every month. If every teacher assigned a manageable project, designed by themselves, every student would com into that class at the beginning of the year prepared and comfortable with all their assigned projects. 
1304	If teachers create summer projects, rather than students, it gives the students much more structure which is vital for kids, especially at a younger age 
1305	It is important for kids in elementary and middle school to have the leadership of a teacher to rely on. At that age, I hated when teachers gave us total freedom on projects because I would not know what they expected me to do. I needed them to guide me and tell me what the expected out of me, then I would go achieve that. But without explicit directions as a kid, I would struggle to decide what to do to please my teachers 
1306	However, in high school, it is better to give students more freedom because in their careers they will not always have someone telling them what to do every step of the way and they will have to think for themselves 
1307	But, it is not smart to give students complete freedom as they will have someone who wants something specific out of them when they get a job. For example, when I got my first job at an ice cream store I had to figure things out myself as I went, but I could not just do whatever I wanted. I had a task to complete that was specified by my boss, but he was not there every step of the way and left me to figure some things out on my own. That is what summer projects should emulate for high school students, while projects should be much more structured for younger kids. 
1308	Summer projects are great for students and teachers alike, but should be teacher-designed because that way it is easier to follow a specific curriculum, it gets the students used to the teaching style of their new teacher, and it gives students more structure in general. All these reasons are very helpful for students and can not be achieved by student-designed projects. That is why all summer projects should be designed strictly by teachers. 
1309	Although the school system has advanced quite far in recent history, there are still plenty of clear problems with the way children receive their education. Many students are constantly stressed out and are not truly learning the material because of it. Additionally, each student may have a different learning style, so it is not helpful to teach them in large groups with the same methods 
1310	The recent innovation of FACS (Facial Action Coding System) can be utilized by schools to vastly improve the way children are educated. 
1311	As mentioned in paragraph 6 in the article, FACS can be used to recognize when a student is confused. Schools could take advantage of this technology to notify teachers when a student is struggling with material, and help them get back on track. This would allow teachers to adapt their teaching style to best suit each student. 
1312	Furthermore, all different ages of students today are constantly stressed out with the massive workload that is forced upon them each day. One of the many consequences of this is that the students may not actually be learning the material beceause of how focused they are on the responsibilities they have for other classes. A facial recognition system such as FACS could be programmed to detect when a student's facial expression demonstrates stress, and notify the school so they can proactively help the student cope with this stress before the situation worsens. This will help the student relax and focus better. 
1313	The potential of this technology is huge, as it could be used to improve every student's life, both inside and outside of school. If schools were to have the ability to help students with any material they don't understand the first time and asist them in coping with or eliminating stress, it would make the experience of going to school much more enjoyable. This would motivate students to do their best to be successful in school, which would drastically improve their life, as well as society in general. If all schools manage to overcome the technical and monetary difficulties of implementing FACS in teaching, it would benefit everybody in many ways. 
1314	Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during break. In doing this, students may be prepared for the upcoming year when they return to school from break. Many people believe that summer projects should be teacher-designed while others believe that they should be student-designed. 
1315	Students would have more motivation if their summer projects were designed by themselves. 
1316	Besides in the summer, students spend most of the year under the authority of their teachers. If the project they design is on their own terms, they would have more motivation to actually complete it. Since they are no longer under the school's rule during the summer, students may feel more motivated to do their project instead of being forced to do so during the school year. Students would also have more motivation if their summer projects were student-designed because they would not be expected to meet the expectations of their teacher. If the student designs their summer project to their specific skill set, the student may be more motivated to complete the project because he or she is capable of reaching their own goals. Students would most likely turn in better work because they are not under the stress of their teachers' expectations. Because of this, students would have more motivation if their summer projects were student-designed, 
1317	Summer projects should be student-designed so that students may express their creativity 
1318	Without knowing it, teachers block students' yearn of creativity with their own preferences. If the summer project was teacher-designed, the teacher would provide a rubric that exemplifies the specific ways a teacher wants the project to be completed. In doing this, the teacher is not letting the student use their own creativity to complete their project while still follwoing the rubric, but in their own way.. Creativity should never be restricted by one's own personal opinion. Creativity surfaces better with a clear mind along with a clean slate allowing creativity to flow through. If the summer project was student-designed, the entire project itself would be created from one's creativity and their expression through it. For these reasons, summer projects should be student-designed so that students may express creativity freely. 
1319	The productivity that a student dedicates to a summer project would increase if the project was student-designed instead of being teacher-designed. 
1320	Productivity heightens when the task is something one actually wants to be doing. If the teacher is somewhat forcing the task, it will make students back away from what they need to complete. Since the student them self is coming up with the project, they must have more motivation to do so which makes the entire process much more productive. Especially during the summer, productivity may decrease because students are no longer in the correct head space that schoolwork requires. If the project is teacher- designed, then the productivity relating to the project will continue to dwindle as well. If the project is student-designed, the time and effort put into the project would heighten which would increase the productivity of the project as well. Hence my reasoning as to why summer projects should be student-designed rather than having them be teacher-designed. 
1321	Motivation, creativity, and productivity would all increase if students' summer projects were student-designed. If students were able to use their own creativity to create a project to be completed in the summer, it would not only increase students' motivation and productivity during the completion of the project, it would also decrease the amount of stress students tackle because of their teachers' expectations. Therefore, summer projects should not be teacher-designed but instead, be student-designed to ensure motivation, creativity, and productivity. 
1322	With summer break comes the joy of sleeping in and spending the day with friends, allowing students to be free from the stress that school may cause them. However, as students enjoy their freedom, they end up losing the knowledge they have carefully built up over the course of the school year. To combat this issue, some schools have implemented summer projects that students must complete over the course of their summer break. The issue with the mandatory summer projects is whether or not they should be designed by the students or by the teachers. 
1323	While it can be said that creating the project would allow the students to retain the information better, there is no guarantee that the information itself would be accurate. Any student can make a worksheet or an assignment based on what they have learned, but few can do it correctly. If student-designed projects are done incorrectly, then the purpose of the project is completely disregarded; the entire point of the summer projects is to make sure students do not forget valuable information. Having teacher-designed projects is a safer and more reliable option. Teachers have studied the subject for years and have experience, meanwhile students are only just beginning to understand the concepts of the subject. Teachers must be able to determine whether or not what they are doing with their students is not superficial, but actually necessary and needed for the students 
1324	 The projects designed by teachers provide a safety net for their students, while the projects designed by students would be a gamble. 
1325	Though it is important that students are able to successfully work on their own, their ability to collaborate with peers and help one another is extremely beneficial for them. 
1326	Making students design their own project is not only extremely stressful, it also isolates them from other students and from help. Teacher-designed projects would be uniform, meaning every students receives the same project. 
1327	It would allow them to look to classmates for help if needed, or to even work together as a unit to get the project done. The collaboration would lessen the burden on the students and would also let them enjoy their summer break. Creating their own projects would quickly become overwhelming for students, especially if they have no one to turn to for support. Instead of focusing on the information like they are supposed to, the panicked students would focus only on finishing their assignment before it is due, thus defeating the purpose of the project. 
1328	The main goal of summer projects is to provide students with a way to retain everything they have learned and to be prepared for their next school year, regardless of who creates the projects. To best achieve this goal, teachers should be the ones who design the projects. Teacher-designed projects would provide everything that students will need, as well as allow them breathing room during their well deserved break from school. Overall, teachers designing the projects would be a win-win for everyone involved. The students would feel confident and prepared, while the teachers would not have to worry about going over concepts from the year prior. At the end of the day, as long as the students feel comfortable and prideful of their work that was created by a teacher, then that is all that matters. 
1329	Student designed projects would be way better than teacher designed projects because students have more imagination therefore it would make the project more interesting. 
1330	Within the past decade, humans have watched in awe as technology has improved exponentially, and learned to take on tasks once thought only humans could accomplish. Technology has been taught to communicate, entertain, solve problems, along with many other functions, and now it may be able to teach as well. 
1331	Though we have made use of every technological advancement in the past, this may be one that we should not capitalize on. 
1332	Before taking this enourmous step in technological advancement, humans must consider the flaws within this newly developed system, 
1333	whether we are ready to replace teachers with computers. 
1334	Though this new system is an astonishing feat in technology, people muct recognize the flaws within this system as well. 
1335	As described in paragraph 6, a students facial expression has the power to change a lesson. If this is true, could a student not simply fake an emotion to get out of assignments or slack off by acting confused. The article claims that the software can pick up on fake smiles, but can it detect false expressions for other emotions as well? Another flaw within this system is the emotions the technology is capable of percieving, paragraph 6 disscusses the modification of a lesson based on boredom or confusion detected by the computer, however, neither of these two feelings are listed in the 6 emotions that the software is capable of detecting (paragraph 3). These two major flaws within the software lead to only one conclusion, the technology is simply not advanced enough to take on the role of a teacher. 
1336	Humans must also consider this issue from an ethical standpoint, are we ready to take away the role of teachers and replace them with software? 
1337	Though machines have already taken away menial jobs, such as factory work, teaching is a career which requires a four year college degree and a license. Countless people aspire to become teachers, are we ready to take that away? Even if teachers were to work hand in hand with this technology there would still be flaws. Having a computer read the emotions of a student rather than a teacher would sever immportant student teacher ties, and cheat that student of the oppurtunity of a mentor relasionship. Because people are already capable of reading emotions, it would be foolish to replace that for a less precise piece of equipment. Because of the immportant role of teachers in the lives of students, the push for emotion detecting software in the classroom should be stopped. 
1338	Because of the major systematic flaws, and the ethical dilemas accompaniing this issue, it is clear that at least for the time being, the efforts to integrate emotion detecting software into the the cassroom should be put on hold. Though this is an astonishing advancement in technology, there is much to consider before pursuing this movement. 
1339	"Some cities are making themselves car-free. Like in Vauban, Germany; Paris; Bogota, Colombia; and even the president of the United States is trying to ""curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions"" (Rosenthal, Paragraph 29). In Vauban, Germany residents of a community are ""going where few soccer moms or commuting executives have ever gone before: the have given up their cars"" (Rosenthal, Paragraph 1). "
1340	The summer preceding eleventh grade was by far my most memorable summer for an atypical reason - the summer assignment. This summer assignment, unlike any others, was student-designed. In the same summer I had multiple other summer assignments: annotating a textbook, completing a packet of math problems, and even writing an eight page essay! However, my wise AP Biology teacher decided to deviate from the norm by assigning a student-designed summer project. This project only had one rule: it had to relate to any part of the curriculum. To this day, I can vividly recall details about my project, its relevance to the curriculum, and the biology concepts covered throughout the project. Although many teachers around the globe have difficulties determining whether teacher created or student created summer projects are more beneficial, 
1341	student designed summer projects increase student engagement, 
1342	they allow for students to learn more than they would in teacher designed projects. 
1343	Student developed summer assignments are better than those developed by teachers because teachers can eliminate the burden of students who do not complete the assignment, students can connect their interests to the curriculum, and teachers can cover a variety of topics to engage students. Summer is a time for students to relax and take a break from the heavy workload of school. However, it is also important for students to stay engaged by previewing course material for the upcoming school year. Although there are clear benefits to summer assignments, many students decide not to complete them. Teachers have to deal with an annual burden of students who do not complete their summer projects. This burden can easily be eliminated by changing the summer assignment to accommodate for students 
1344	the implementation of student based summer projects can attribute to a variety of skills necessary in the workplace such as creativity, independence, and resourcefulness. 
1345	Employers all over the world seek individuals who are creative because creativity drives innovation, which positively impacts the future in many ways. By allowing students to develop their own projects, teachers are fueling creative growth. Not only are they fueling creative growth, but they are establishing independence. Independence is a vital life skill that can contribute to success. When teacher allow students to independently create their own projects, they are supplying their students with the key to success. Independently developed projects also force students to be resourceful. Projects without clear cut instructions cause students to seek alternate sources for their projects. When not equipped with the guidance and resourcefulness of their teacher, students seek sources such as textbooks, databases, and search engines to conduct research and complete the project. Student designed summer projects are crucial to the development of creativity, independence, and resourcefulness in students. 
1346	detractors may argue that teacher designed summer projects connect the student to the curriculum better than student designed summer projects can, 
1347	this is false. Students learn best when they are able to connect their own ideas to the curriculum, explore the curriculum by themselves, and conduct self-learning, all of which are only possible via student designed summer projects. 
1348	Psychology teaches us the value of peg words, or words that are associated with a concept in order to improve memory function. Similar to how peg words stimulate memory by associating two concepts, student designed summer assignments associate the student's interests with the curriculum, thereby enhancing the student's retention. 
1349	Student developed summer projects are integral in a education because it allows students to be more engaged in their learning, create a wide array of skills needed in the workforce, and increase student retention. To this day, I reflect on my AP Biology summer assignment and wonder whether it would have had such a large impact on me if it had been a teacher designed summer project. Based solely on the evidence, I do not believe that the summer assignment would have been beneficial had it been designed by a teacher. For this reason, I encourage teachers across the globe to enforce student designed summer projects in order to create an impact similar to that of my AP Biology teacher.  
1350	Our society's reliance on technology has increased significantly in the past few decades.  Mobile phones were once brick-like impractical devices. Since then, they have evolved into sleek mini computers. Now that phones are more portable, people tend to take their cell with them everywhere, including on the road. With the heavy reliance our society has created around these devices, it is, understandably, difficult to resist using them. For this very reason, cell phones pose a great risk to driver's. The distraction imposed by smartphones can be just as harmful as driving under the influence. 
1351	Using cell phones at all while driving should absolutely not be allowed. Any amount of attention diverted from the road is incredibly dangerous. 
1352	 Some of the most fatal accidents have occured, not because of intoxication, but as a result of texting and driving. 
1353	In 2018, 4,637 people died in car crashes due to cell phone use (The Zebra). That is 4,637 lives that could have been spared if it weren't for the recklessness of irresponsible drivers. In 2002, 62% of people owned regular cell phones, while today, in 2019, about 95% of americans own cell phones. 77% of these modern cell phones owners have smartphones, which can be even more distracting (Pew Research Center). In that time, car accidents caused by cell phone distraction has increased from 6% to 25% of all car accidents (Schlossberg 2002, Miller & Zois 2019). There is a clear correlation between the increased reliance of cell phones and distracted driving accidents. The irresponsible actions of these drivers is causing increased danger on our roads. Leniency cannot be accepted. The law should have absolutely no tolerance for this hazardous driving. 
1354	"The article later goes on to state, ""You cannot focus on one while doing the other. That's because of what's called interference between the two tasks."" Based off of this information, it can be inferred the concept of interference is also applicable to using a smartphone while driving. If a driver is busy paying attention to their screen, there is no way they could also be paying close attention to the road. "
1355	"One personal injury lawyer states, ""A single text results in an average distraction of 5 seconds, during which time a car going 55 mph will travel the length of a football field"" (Miller & Zois). A range this large in a such a short time span conveys how much potential there is for injury when behaving so carelessly. Anyone who may claim it is safe for them to go on their phone while operating a vehicle because they are a master at multitasking is simply overconfident in their abilities. The truth is, it would be impossible for anyone to drive safely while distracted.  With lives at risk, texting and driving should be out of the question. Not only would such negligence put one's own physical well being at risk, but all those around them as well. "
1356	Thousands of deaths could be prevented each year if everyone were to simply put their phone down while driving. No notification, song, or post is worth compromising the safety of the general public. Ensuring others' security should be a priority for all americans. When one fourth of car accidents involve cell phones, there is a serious problem. Complete focus and concentration on the road while driving should just be common sense. Keep the phone down.  
1357	"When my friend asked me to do I thought, ""I knew this was an opportunity of a lifetime."" "
1358	you travel all over the world. 
1359	"As the author defends the claim that the exploration of Venus is a ""worthy pursuit,"" I, however, believe that this statement is not proven very efficiently. Although the author refers to NASA and the experiments they've carried out, the information just does not sufficiently back up the statement that Venus is a ""worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents."" "
1360	The author continuously describes the challenge it would be for humans to carry out the study of Venus from space, 
1361	Many risks would be taken in order to physically explore Venus, 
1362	"As stated in the text, the conditons on the planet are ""far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth."" Even with advanced technology that we have today, the article states that ""no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours."" If the technology we have today can't even survive the conditions on Venus, how are humans supposed to be able to? Even though the author claims the conditions are ""not easy, but survivable for humans,"" the temperature can climb up to over 800 degrees Fahrenheit. These pieces of evidence from the excerpt convey the idea that Venus and its characteristics are far too dangerous for humans to even go near. "
1363	"Even though humans could possibly hover 30 miles above the ground level, the texts states that the vast distance would provide only ""limited insight on ground conditions,"" and it would ""[render] standard forms of photography and videography ineffective."" Along with that, the author admits that ""researchers would not be able to take samples...from a distance."" The challenge that the study provides would simply not be worth the time, money, and risks. If man were to go to extreme lengths to reach within 30 miles of a planet and not be able to collect and evidence or data, it would not be a successful mission if the goal was to obtain new information about the planet. "
1364	"When examining the similarities between Earth and Venus, the author uses the word ""probably,"" saying that ""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."" The word ""probably"" gives off the impression that the author is making an assumption about the fact that Venus could support life just like Earth based on a common feature between the two planets. It is dangerous to make assumptions about subjects such as this, because it would be very costly if it turned out to be incorrect in the end. "
1365	After considering both sides of this controversial claim, I believe the author did not support the claim that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. 
1366	Although the author referred to the study being beneficial to man's sense of imagination and innovation, 
1367	As of 2017, an estimated 270 million people have a cell phone in the United States. Cell phones have been an everyday object that is addictive and is used for the majority of a day. In particular, cell phones are commonly used while driving, even though it sounds dangerous. 
1368	Driving requires focus on the road as well as the driver's surroundings and using cell phones while driving prevents that from occurring 
1369	Cell phones should not be used while driving because of the many dangers that tend to result from it.  
1370	Cell phones are extremely distracting because of the large amount of focus operating one requires. 
1371	While driving, cell phones divert a driver's visual focus from the road to the screen of the mobile device which is very dangerous. The driver isn't able to see what's in front of them because their eyes are locked in on the screen of a cell phone which can possibly lead to a variety of negative outcomes. Texting while driving can lead to harm to health, government involvement, and vehicular harm.' 
1372	1 out of every 4 car accidents are caused by texting while driving and in the United States over 1.6 million car crashes occur annually. That means that every year over 400,000 car accidents result from texting and driving 
1373	Cell phone usage itself has a very negative impact on the body's health due to the blue light it transmits. The blue light hurts the eyes and is extremely detrimental while texting and driving. A driver must have good eyesight so that they are aware of their surroundings but using cell phones/mobile devices while driving hinders that 
1374	Police officers have the ability to give a driver a citation/ticket for texting while driving. However, a significantly large number of drivers have found a loophole to evade getting a ticket and/or citation. They would not text and drive but instead they would have their cell phones in their hand but not actually text and drive. In order to counteract this loophole, some states have enforced a policy which states that a driver can be penalized for being in possession of a cell phone/mobile device when the vehicle is in motion. These policies are implemented so that no harm can occur due to cell phone usage while driving. 
1375	Texting while driving can lead to the quality of the vehicle declining due to any damage it may face such as a wreck. On the financial side, the vehicle's interest rate will most likely increase because texting while driving can lead to receiving tickets and/or citations that a driver potentially may receive.  The vehicle itself is something that the driver should bring into consideration and not use their cell phone/device while driving so that no harm comes to the vehicle. 
1376	The concept of using cell phones/mobile devices while driving is one that needs to get rid of immediately. There are countless outcomes that result from cell phone usage while driving and all of them are negative ones which shows that it should be banned. The health risks are severe as well as the vehicular risks and the government has had to step in because of the realization that using cell phones while driving is a lose-lose situation no matter what.   
1377	"On the first day of  Summer Break one is thinking about all the things he's going to be doing, like:relax all day, go on vacation, hang out with friends or family, play video games, and do non-school related things. Suddenly, he or she gets an email from their teacher saying,""I hope everyone is enjoying summer so far, over the summer you will have to do a project on what you have learned this year."" At the end of the email is the instructions the teacher says you have to do for your project. After reading the email one closes his laptop or turns off his phone with anger, because that one teacher ruined his summer.  How are people supposed to enjoy their summer break when a teacher gives them school-related stuff to do. Some teachers complain all the time about them having to grade all types of work when a student doesnt do his work. Teachers shouldn't complain because,all they had to do is not give students any work especially over the summer. Then that will make the teachers job way much easier, because they won't have much stuff to grade and worry about planning to do. "
1378	"He states that Venus is often referred to as Earth's ""twin"". This is because Venus and Earth are close in size, density, and at some points in orbit are the closest planets in the solar system. It is also believed that at one point, Venus was a lot like Earth is now. ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" states, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our soloar system."". The article goes on to say Venus most likely had large oceans that supported life, and the planet has things like craters, valleys, and mountains that we also have here on Earth. The author including these details helps get the point across that Venus is a lot like Earth, and with the little research been done already, we've found so much. This helps readers understand that the longer Venus is studied, the more we will learn about it. "
1379	Next, the author gives possible ways to study Venus safely, and effciently. 
1380	"The author states, ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray."". Stating ways that Venus can be studied with people not being put in danger helps get the authors point across. The article also touches on how floating above the surface could keep those studying the planet safe. Temperatures would still be high, but nothing the spacecraft couldn't handle, the air pressure would be like how it is on Earth at sea level, soloar power would be bountiful, and radiation would be no higher than the levels on Earth. The text then states, ""Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."". Although this would not be an easy job, it is possible to study Venus safely. The details used in this paragraph help convey the authors point that studying Venus can be done safely and that it should continue to happen. "
1381	Last, the author gives more ways Venus can be studied safely using different technology. 
1382	"While talking about different approaches to studying Venus the author states, ""...simplified electronics...have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks..."". This quote also helps the reader understand that studying Venus can be done in a safe and harmless way. Using this new technology could help research on Venus advance, and keep those doing the research out of harm's way. The author then goes on to talk about a different technology that was used in World War 2 that can also be used as a new method to study Venus. These are called mechanical computers, and they use gears and levers rather than the electronics that actual computers use. The mechanical computers are made of mechanical parts which are stronger, so they shouldn't be damaged as easily. These are just a few of the ways technology can help safely advance the study of Venus.  "
1383	"In conclusion, it is important Venus is continued to be studied and researched. The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" does a great job of conveying to his audience why studying Venus is important even though it is dangerous. In the last paragraph, the author says, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value..."". Studying Venus can help advance many things, and our knowledge of other planets could grow from this as well. There have been many safe ways found to study Venus, so it should be done. The author also states that, ""Our travels on Earth should not be limited by dangers and doubts..."". This quote also shows that the author believes the study of Venus should continue even though it can be dangerous. If we didn't study things just because they're dangerous, then we would have nothing dicovered. The author of this article believes the study of Venus should continue, and does very well at conveying that by telling the audience Earth and Venus are a lot alike, gives new, safer ways to study Venus, and gives examples of technology that could also make the study of Venus a lot safer and easier. "
1384	When Alexander the Great led the great conquest of the Old World he never ceased his search for knowledge and the pleasure of learning. Taught by Aristotle, a great philosopher, Alexander expanded his intellectual frontiers of philosophy and culture with every new victory. He recognized that even during the periods of downtime in his empire, there was much to learn. Similarly, many schools require their students to participate in summer assignments built to prepare their minds for the upcoming year. 
1385	However, while some advocate for teacher designed summer programs, schools would provide summer assignments that benefit the students more if the assignments were to be designed by students 
1386	Student designed assignments would teach the style of the class, 
1387	expose the rigor of the content 
1388	test the readiness of the students before they enter the door. 
1389	No two classes are taught the exact same. When teachers standardize the content of their summer assignments between other teachers and themselves, they lose the ability to expect their students to perform at the specific standards of the teacher and present information in a style at which they deem is appropriate 
1390	Having students design the summer assignments would allow future students to realize what stylistic choices the class may require and how the day to day of the class operates. 
1391	A teacher's reality of a class that they teach differs greatly from that of the student's. Students would be able to suggest to future students helpful tips that would help them from day one of the class such as the teacher liking when students turn in assignments at a certain font size or type or the teacher prefers active over passive voice when writing. Additionally, student designed assignments would give future students the opportunity to see what the class is really like. A teacher may overlook the fact that their class etiquette and canon is to start with a warm up, then work through problems, and finally teach new material. Students who have grown accustomed to a certain style of classroom procedure would have the opportunity to give future students the appropriate expectations of what class is really like prior to the start of school. 
1392	Student designed assignments would educate future students as to what kind of work ethic is needed for such a class. 
1393	The teacher may have one perception of how rigorous a class is. 
1394	However, the students' overall concensus as to what the work load is would be more congruent with how future classes would perceive it. 
1395	Lastly, student designed assignments would test the capabilities of the student more accurately. 
1396	When a teacher designs a summer assignment. The content is focused on learning two weeks worth of course related information prior to attending school. Student designed assignments would, in turn, test the intellectual cognition of future students. This would weed out students who may learn come October or November that they do not have the necessary skills to succeed in the class and it is not worth their efforts to continue. Student designed reports would test the readiness of the future students. Furthermore, many AP and advanced classes require students to understand and know how to use the jargon of the classroom. Such vernacular includes contextualization, thesis statement, historical analysis, free-response question, and document based question. Prior to their first day in an AP class, students are widely unfamiliar with the language and testing system of their class and therefore struggle with the tests and essays in practice. Student designed reports would expose future students to this material as well as test the individual's ability to perform at a satisfactory level in the class. 
1397	While some teacher designed assignments benefit the students by learning factual information that will benefit them over the first two weeks of school, student designed reports would enable teachers and students to have a better academic relationship over the course of the entire school year. By exposing the students to the style, rigor, and expectations of the class, students will know what they are getting themselves into far better than if they were to read and annotate a book that is relevant for the better half of a month. Students would also give future students the ability to practice their skills if they so choose to do so; preparing future students for the essay styles of rhetorical analysis, document based questions, and free response questions that are synonymous with the AP brand. Because of these reasons, teacher designed assignments holds a dim candle to the flaming torch of student designed assignments that would benefit future classes throughout the entire year. 
1398	Today in the 21st century , phones have evolved to more of a necessity than that of a want. Almost everyone has phone these days and use it very frequently. Cell phones can be very distracting in every day activities like school , work , and worst of all , driving . The United States 1 out of 4 car accidents is due to driving while using a phone . That's 1.6 million crashes per year ! The use of phones while driving has escalated over the years and it is getting more prevalent 
1399	One reason as to why people should not be able to use their phone while driving is because the risk of death is so high 
1400	The use of cell phones while driving now has taken place as the leading cause of death in the United States . The leading cause before that was drinking while driving . Statistically ,1 in 4 car crashes in the United States are caused by the use of cell phones while driving . 391,000 people were injured due to that in 2017 which doesn't even compare itself to the low number of 39,773 gun deaths in 2017 . Both of these are horrible situations to ever be in but a lot of people are ignorant to the toll driving while using your cell phone is . Though the numbers are generally associated with teenagers , these statistics could be any ones' life . Life is precious and the fact that it can be lost for some careless act is not ideal and should be stopped . 
1401	Some people view it was selfish that one person would risk sending a text knowing that it has the potential to kill an innocent person or peoples . A text can always wait when others' lives are on the line . Its an over-estimation of one's personal confidence when driving . Noone that texts and drives really thinks and analyzes the hard that they are doing or can do to all the people in the cars around them . In the cars are innocent mothers , fathers, children , veterans , teachers ect . It goes without saying that they don't deserve to die due to someone thinking that because they've texted and driven before , noone will die . 
1402	Even if at a red light , don't be a selfish person and respond to a text . If the temptation is too high , turn your phone off or put it away somewhere in your car . Make sure to be alert of your surroundings and stay focused while driving . And if one day it so happens that the person who is driving you happens to be texting and driving , speak out . If you would want to help the cause you can always speak out and promote safety in you community . 
1403	Too many people have lost their lives due to either their own decision to text and drive , or someone else's selfish decision . Many companies and state governments are currently trying to fix these horrible statistics and put and end to texting and driving . States have already passed laws to make is illegal to be using the phone while driving . Our current culture has become too dependent on technology and we must learn to resist the temptation and impulse . We must realize that life is too precious and too valuable to let it be taken away due to a text message . Once we and other people realize how deadly and dangerous texting and driving is , we can prevent the statistics to grow even more for future generations .       
1404	During summer break, many students are busy on vacation or are preoccupied with other activities. Because of this, students are not reinforcing what they have previously learned or preparing for the upcoming school year. Summer projects are an efficient way to get students familiar with and exposed to concepts they will learn in school and bolster their knowledge. However, the decision of making summer projects either teacher-designed or student-designed creates a debate of the effectiveness of both types of projects. 
1405	as teachers are more knowledgeable with the curriculum which will allow them to prepare an assignment that is more effective for the student, 
1406	teacher-assigned projects will provide a guide for what the students will or should learn 
1407	students will most likely feel more prepared for school with an assignment created by the teacher.  
1408	Since teachers know more about the subject they teach more than the students, having teachers create their own assignment for their students will be more effective 
1409	Teacher-designed projects will be a guide for students during their summer break to study useful information for their classes. 
1410	Teachers can design projects that is relevant to the curriculum of the class and plan out what is necessary and useful to know versus what is not. In addition, teachers usually expose basic ideas and important concepts that will help students to make connections to what they learned through the summer assignment. These teacher-designed also provides some insight for the student on what to expect in the courses that they take. 
1411	Having teachers make their own summer projects will expose the material that students need to know when they go back to school. It will help students to feel more comfortable coming to class and ready to begin learning. 
1412	Not only do teacher-designed projects enforce learning and help students to get more comfortable with the content of the class, but they also prepare students before the upcoming school year begins. It is ideal for teachers to design such projects as they know most about the curriculum of the class, and it allows them to prepare a useful tool for students to study to get familiar with concepts and important ideas of the class. These projects are a small exposure of what students are expected or need to know and will help them to be more successful when they begin learning in their classes.         
1413	It would promote creativity within the students. 
1414	it would allow for the students to make a choice for themselves. 
1415	It would help them become more independent and self reliant. The students already have to do what the teacher says during the school year, so this would make for a great chance for them to do what they need to on their own time. It would also teach them to be responsible for themselves and for their own work. For example, if the student understands that they are no longer in a classroom setting where the teacher explains everything to them, they will conclude they must rely on themselves to complete the task at hand. Which would lead to more independence rather than depending on the teacher. 
1416	if the project was designed by the teacher it would b a more stable and set curriculum. The teacher knows exactly what they are looking for, so for the project to be designed by a teacher would allow for the project to be more organized. 
1417	On the other hand, it would take away the idea of creativity and the chance to express ones self had the project been student designed. Which would lead to less effort being put into the projects. If the students are given the chance to do as they please freely they can put more time and effort into it. 
1418	Schools allowing for these summer projects to be created by the students would be greatly beneficial. It gives the students a chance to be as creative as they please and express themselves openly. It also is a good opportunity to teach them the importance of self reliance and how to take responsibility. These are all valuable skills that are going to be needed by the students during a later time in life. It is good to get these skills in early so that the students will understand how to use them later when it is important. 
1419	Since the invention of the first automobiles, negative impacts such as greenhouse gases, and other enviromental effects have plauged the world in a very short amount of time. Some people are taking action, like in certain cities such as Vauban Germany, paris and Colombia, by taking efforts to reduce the use of cars for transportation. 
1420	Ultimatly, as people begin the shift from autombile transport; certain economic, enviromental, and societal advantages will benifit the world we live in today. 
1421	"In Vauban germany, residents of the town are starting to take efforts in the first of ""car-free"" societies. To most people this idea could seem unpractical, but car free living can be very benefitial, to the enviroment and daily life. "
1422	For instance, people in Vauban claim that they feel very tense when they own, and have to drive a car to and from places that they have to work. The layout of these cities like vauban, are unique because they are very dense, unlike the urban and suburban towns of america. This makes walking and biking a more easy method of transportation without having the negative effects of green house gases. In Bogota Colombia, residents are also realizing the the benefits that come with no cars, in wich they have a car- free day that spawns a whole new way of life. The new methods of transportation then become centered around bikes, walking, and other methods of non poluting trasnportation. This also leads to a benefit on the economy, by having 118 miles of bicycle paths built, new walking paths, resturaunts, and shopping districts being created. 
1423	In Paris, near-records pollution caused by smog, forced city leaders to take action, banning all cars in a 2 day period; and fining all violators of this new ban. This limited congestion in the capital by 60%. Free public transit was also issued for the exception of the ban, even though almost 4000 drivers were fined and some had their cars impound; which certainly helped the number of pollutants on the streets. The smog cleared enough on monday, to where all odd numbered plates were free of the ban on tuesday. These notacable enviromental effects were so substantial in such a short amount of time, that it could spawn a whole new wave of car banning cities to help thier local enviroment 
1424	If every city was based around this ideal, it would help their local enviroment, ultimatly helping their economic industries. Globally, this would make a huge change in the world wide market and decrease greenhouse gases. 
1425	The United States is also seeing a change in the amount of people that are buying fewer cars and driving less. These kinds of trends will ultimatly benefit the society if continued, by limiting carbon emissions. 
1426	Although this would hurt the car industry, it would help other parts of the economy like agriculture and ocean based fishing, by helping these ecosystems to produce more effectivly. Places like New York also have bike-sharing programs, which would have a impact on people's health too. Most people do not realize the postitive effects that daily exercise can have upon yourself. For example; if every person in New york walked to where they work every morning; new york would experiance a wave of healthy, happy, individuals. Even large car companies like ford are stating that pedestrain, bicycle, and public trasprotation save time, lower emissions and improve safety.  
1427	Overall, benifits of reducing car transportation is too great to be ignored. It is a step in the right direction that people are taking action and rising up for the greater good of their local towns and spreading awareness by these actions. Our future could go either way, we can continue on this path and do whats right for the enviroment, or neglect the earth we live on and face the consequences.                              
1428	I think its a great Idea! Extracurricular activities are actually a great thing for students to get involved in for many reasons 
1429	Requiring all students to do extracurricular activities results in students either getting more exercise or using their brain more depending on what they choose 
1430	Students who were skeptical of joining anything extracurricular will finally understand what its like to be a part of something like that and I think most of them will enjoy it. 
1431	Students engaging in activities that require a lot of physical activity such as sports, will be more physically fit and most likely healthier than those who do not. If someone decides they want to sign up for yearbook or student council, they will have the opportunity to greatly improve their problem solving skills 
1432	. Anyone having engaged in either of these will understand what its like to work with a group of people to work together to achieve a common goal 
1433	This will allow students to better understand how to exist in the real world and how to work at their future jobs.  
1434	Anyone who does an extracurricular activity and in this case everyone going to my school will have a better chance of going to college 
1435	Colleges see if and what you have done in terms of extracurricular stuff, because they don't want someone who they think will do the bare minimum and barely get through. Colleges care about their image. So as far as the colleges are concerned good students equals good looks and good looks equals more demand college which equals more money. Part of that image is sports, in fact if you are good enough at a specific sport so much that they want you to be on their team they will pay for you to go to their college, this is called a scholarship. The better the students a college gets the more attractive it looks, the more students my high school sends to college the more attractive my high school looks and the students have a higher chance to go to college, its a win, win, win! 
1436	I feel that it is important in high school to be a part of something like a sport, or yearbook, or student council. 
1437	The sense of community and common interest in a large group of people can really make you feel at home and be a nice thing to look forward to after a long day of school, even if it might be taxing physically or mentally. In anything extracurricular everyone knows everyone, they're all friends united by a common passion and a common goal. This builds strong compromising skills and cooperative skills.  
1438	The principles decision makes kids do something that they will most likely actually really enjoy, something that will very much assist them in getting into college, and something that will allow students to understand how to survive in the real world. It will also benefit my high school and any college any current student at my school goes to in the future. In conclusion, the decision to make all students required to do an extracurricular activity was a fantastic one. 
1439	It's the last day of school, and students are sweating bullets eager for the clock to kick off their summer vacation when the hour-hand strikes two. Suddenly, collective groans echo throughout the entire school when an english teacher hands out a summer reading project. Many schools require students to complete some kind of assignment during their summer break because the school boards believe that it will ensure continued learning. Summer assignments usually ask that students read a book over the summer and fill out some type of summary or chart. Many students have great disdain for summer projects because they can act as a looming annoyance waiting to be accomplished. 
1440	it gives students the ability to work at their own pace, 
1441	promotes interest 
1442	prevents students from copying eachother 
1443	Allowing students to design their own summer project allows them to work at their own pace. 
1444	Schools usually don't account for what home or family students go back to during the summer. A student might go back to a family with elderly or children they have to take care of thus filling up their schedule. Schools also don't account for students who have jobs during the summer. If a teacher assigns a project that consists of several pages of charts, summaries, or questions to fill out, it can slam a ton of stress on students going home to a busy schedule. Giving students the ability to design their own projects benefits students who will be busy over summer break because they can reserve whatever time they can scrap up for making a project that makes their life easier. 
1445	Although not encouraged, this freedom also gives students who procrastinate the ability to make their sleepless night completing said project the day before school starts less stressful 
1446	Giving students the freedom to design their own summer project also promotes interest in the assignment. 
1447	For typical summer projects like reading a book, students are usually given a reading list of books and they're required to read one of the books on the list. The lists arguably always consist of books that students find boring or repetitive when they go over topics they've already studied in the past. Students won't be interested in works they find boring or repetitive so when they're making a project off of it, words, reasoning, and justification will seem empty and made up on the spot. If students are allowed to pick any book they'd like to read over the summer and make an assignment off of it, their interest and passion might shine through in their interpretation of the material. 
1448	Some might say that assignments students make up could be counterproductive since they might not have anything to do with themes or topics that will be learned in the coming school year. 
1449	On the other hand, teachers can simply just note as a minor requirement that students must make one quick connection from their project to any theme that will be studied in the school year. 
1450	Letting students design their own summer projects also prevents them from copying one another. 
1451	One tactic that students will typically use with summer projects like reading a book of their choice and filling out the same chart is to read the same book as a friend and then copy each other answers when they have to turn the project in. If students design their own project, they'll have to show some individuality and creativity on the due date. Teachers will have an easier time telling when students copy each other because if done right, no student should have created the same project. If two students are caught clearly copying off each other on a project meant for individuality, they can be punished accordingly. Everyone will turn something different in at least some way when they aren't spoon fed a big packet and instead get to create their own packet. 
1452	Overall, both students and teachers benefit when students are the ones who make the summer project because students work at their own pace, create something they might be interested in, and display their individuality in learning more accurately. Students who procrastinate, have jobs, or take care of family over the summer will heave a sigh of relief. Students will be grateful they'll have a more creative, individual project to complete when they're bored during the summer and not a big, scary one that's due the day they get back to school. Less groans will echo throughout schools when students hear that they have more freedom in an assignment given for what's supposed to be a break.  
1453	The death toll for 2018 is 18,720 and an additional 2.1 million people who have sustained serious injuries due to car accidents in the first six months of 2018. 
1454	A student's freedom from the limitations of the classroom's necessary rules during the summer provides new opportunities for them to learn in dynamic ways. While, in the classroom, a teacher's control of a regulated learning program is unavoidable in order to teach such a broad audience in such a short time, there are no such factors outside the classroom. The variable shape of a student's summer project provides a unique opportunity for the student's specific educational needs to be accounted for - which a teacher-designed project wouldn't be able to take advantage of. 
1455	it instills a certain independence from adult figures that will be necessary later in life. 
1456	Students learn in many different ways. Psychological studies have shown that there are different types of learning, from spacial to audio to visual, and students learn better in some ways than others. A rising awareness of mental health has also led to the understanding that brains process information in different ways, so students with autism or ADHD don't get the same results from the conventional classroom practices. Student-designed summer projects would be able to take all these different specifications into account when structuring the project, so visual learners could visit exhibitions while attention deficient kids could apply whatever technique they need to help them study (listening to music for some, a totally still room for others) 
1457	The dynamic nature of a student-designed project would be an advantage to the kids who need to learn in a different way from the regulated, cookie-cutter methods that teachers use. 
1458	As well, a student-designed project could angle more in the direction of what the student wants to learn about. Students are forced to spend hours of a day paying attention to subject matters that they don't care for in order to get a generalized education. However, the point of a summer project is education itself, not education towards the goal of a degree. Students would be able to design a project that deepens their interest in a topic, broadens their knowledge in a niche industry. Education would feel more like a hobby than a chore if a student could account for what they learn and how they want to learn it. 
1459	A student-designed summer project would be exciting for students, because the agency over their education would allow them to create highly specified and perfect learning courses for themselves 
1460	Going through a program that teaches them in a way that they both understand and enjoy would be exciting and possibly life changing. The modern school system is the most monstrous source of stress on the childhood and adolescent mind. Even though learning should be acknowledged as a privilege, wonder, and necessity, it becomes a burden to students. Between the forced socialization of the classroom environment, administrations that care more for policy than the experience of the individual, a constantly building workload, and a set of rules and grades that are constantly judging and disciplining behavior, schooling becomes nightmarish for students. The poor environment weighs so heavily on the minds of children that they often develop mental illnesses or complexes, and, in extreme cases, are driven to suicide over poor grades (which, in the grand scheme of life, should be menial). Student-designed summer projects would be a way to show students that learning can be a growing and nurturing experience, instead of a murderous one. That change in outlook in the mind of a student could make all the difference in that student's optimism, well being, and quality of life for the rest of their schooling career. 
1461	One of the main focuses of school is to prepare a student for adulthood. While school accomplishes that in many ways, it fails to teach students how to truly act independently, because their lives are always in some way being influenced by adults that hold real power. A student-designed summer project would fill this void of education, however, because it encourages students to make choices for themselves and then to carry through with those choices in order to make them a reality. Placing the responsibility of their own education on a student would encourage them to think critically and organizationally in order to create and then implement a strategy. The limitless possibilities of the project, because the design is given over to the student, would teach them how to narrow down vague concepts into specific plans. Even arranging for certain resources to be supplied, depending on the project, would show the student how to control moving parts - whether that manifests in asking their mother to buy eggs from the grocery store or in biking to the library to check out the necessary reading materials. Students are rarely prepared for the autonomy of college and the time-managing aspects of adulthood, because they're used to their parents or teachers doing things for them 
1462	Forcing a student to design a project that they then have to complete would be an introduction into the decision making of adulthood. 
1463	A student-designed summer project would help students grow, because they could change their views on the operations of education in the span of a few months. They would grow to be stronger learners, more persistent observers, and more assertive leaders. Since life is really a process of learning--whether that means learning skills, academics, or something else entirely--an easy relationship with the concept of learning is the most valuable thing for a person to develop. Student-designed projects are an easy opportunity to encourage and teach that kind of relationship, and students would develop an outlook on learning that would improve the way they interact with the world for the rest of their lives.  
1464	Students may need to take care of family members right after they leave school. 
1465	Most students get loads of homework or assignments to finish between the week. 
1466	Students may not like the after school activities, or they would rather go home. 
1467	Students sometimes at home need to become the parent for their younger siblings. This carries on the responsibility to feed and watch the child. The student may also need to pick up their younger siblings at the bus stop or daycare, being late to either of those would lead to a bigger problem. Having a parent come home late would push the responsibility to make sure the students sibling is put to bed at the right time. It might take hours for smaller children to sleep, this can badly effect the students sleep. The students responsibilities lead them to have no time for after school activities. 
1468	With the students work load teachers give them, they wouldn't be able to have time for extracurricular 
1469	Teachers like to assign lots of homework and assignments to students. This leads to the student spending their time doing work. Students also take the responsibility to make sure its all due before or the day of. This happens to force the student to keep their minds on school work instead of activities. After school activities would just be a handful between homework and assignments. Having a large handful can lead to stress. With the student having no time left extra curriculum would be out of the question. 
1470	Most students end up having a long day at school. This can effect on how the student feels by the end of the day. 
1471	Students would rather go home and relax then to do an activity right after a long day. After school activities would ruin the students motivation to do anything. Students need a break from school. The perfect time for that would be after school hours. Allowing the student to have a time for themselves would let their brain relax and letting their body refresh. Students should allow themselves to have breaks after school, this wouldn't happen if students had to do a extracurricular. 
1472	The author does not care what kind of dangers there is because he thinks Venus is a planet that is worth to study. As he tries to get a closer look at. NASA has been also trying to help make machines and new inventions that are safe for people to go up and for themselves. Although the challenges that they have read, seen, or have heard kept stopping them from figuring out how to get closer to Venus. However, they did not give up because they kept looking for other ways to explore Venus. 
1473	Should people use their phones while driving? Well 1 out of every 4 car accidents in the United States is caused by texting and driving. People are so distracted by their phones they forget about their own safety at risk while driving. While you're driving you should be more focused on the road and your surrounds more than a Facebook notification. It's not only teens that do this adults as well use their phones while driving. It is one of the leading reasons of car accidents today. Not only are you putting yourself at risk but you're putting others in risk as well. 
1474	In fact, the average text sent or read in a car takes a driver's eyes off the road for 5 seconds. This is more than enough time to get in a life-altering accident. Now in the matter of 5 seconds of looking at your phone you can cause yourself to getting in a really bad accident. Now if you get caught texting or using your phone while driving you can get in some trouble. Violation of the law is a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of $25 for a first offense, $50 for a second offense, and $75 for a third offense. The penalty for a first offense for violating the texting law is a fine of $20 to $400 and up to four points on the driving record of the offender. So are you sure you willing to pay the fine or do the time for texting while driving. It really isn't worth it you can wait until you get to your destination. There more things important than your phone while you're driving like the road than an Instagram notification.  
1475	Take for example the many young students who have died while driving because they were texting. Looking around while driving, you can see people distracted by their cell phones. These people are not only teenagers but also adults. The shocking truth is that texting while driving increases the chances of crashing by over 23 times normal driving. People have a longer response time when they text. Then the passengers may not be looking at the road because they may be on their phones. On average, an accident happens within two to three seconds when the driver is texting. So if you do get into an accident you could do major damages to another person car or worse you could cause severe health damage to the other person that was in the other vehicle. Using a cell phone while driving caused an estimated 1.5 million car accidents in the U.S. in 2018 according to the National Safety Council. The U.S. Department of Transportation reported that cell phone use while driving kills 3-000 to 6,000 people every year including the other that got was in the accident because of the bad driver. 
1476	In the summer, student's minds are in the clouds, and they often forget that they have a summer school project to work on. Of course, this is always a bummer to have, and when students have to start on a project that the teacher has designed for them, it's even worse. Students are more likely to procrastinate, work on the project last minute, and have the mindset of thinking that the project that they have to work on is dumb. The lack of motivation and creativity will end up of making the project not as bright, and rather dull looking, as they struggle working on the project in the summer. However, if a student is able to design their own project, they would be able to put more effort into completing the project and be more creative on how they will complete the project. 
1477	A student should be able to design their own project 
1478	As a student myself, I tend to put more effort into my work when I know I can have fun with it. Instead of working on summer project that is picked by a teacher, the idea of picking my own project-design seems more motivating and more enjoyable to work on. When students have the option to work on a project that they can choose from, they end up forgetting that they are working on a project. Instead, they are just having fun and thinking that they are just working on a new summer hobby. The more people that enjoy on what their project is going to be, they are more likely to complete the project faster and not procrastinate on the project. 
1479	This makes students gain better work ethic and not be lazy when completing a project they know that they don't have motivation for. 
1480	A student-designed project either allows students to become more creative or have students show off their creativity skills 
1481	Rather than just meeting the requirements that the teacher has given them, a student can go above and beyond on a project when they choose their own project. If the school gives students their own way to create their summer project, it can show teachers how they work when they present them when the students go back to school. Allowing students to show off their skills can show both students and teachers what that student can do, and he/she can inspire other students to become more creative when there is another project that is assigned to them. 
1482	 Although if a teacher-designed project would be assigned to students, it would be easier for teachers to grade, as they already understand the topic(s) that is chosen for them. 
1483	However, students would barely learn anything about the topic that is chosen for them, because they are forced to work on that topic. Also when the students are back in school and they have to present their projects, the other students might not even pay attention to their classmates presenting, because they would already know the information that is going to be said. The classmates that I've talk to in my school state to my that they have more fun with a project when they get to pick their own topic to choose from, and tend to pay attention more to when their classmates present different projects topics. 
1484	 As it for being summertime when students have to work on their projects, it should be fun for them, as summertime is supposed to be time for students to have a break from school. That means not only they should enjoy their time tanning by the pool, vacationing, or even hanging out with their friends and family, they should work on a project that really speaks out to them, so that they can feel motivated to work on the project. If a project is assigned to students in the summer, it should be a student-designed project, so that it is more enjoyable/motivational, creative, and beneficial when helping them learn. This should help students enjoy their summer while continuing their learning.  
1485	Ever since cars were invented, they have widely been used as the primary source of transportation. They became so commonplace that their widespread use started to introduce negative impacts . As a result, some countries, or cities, have recently put in place programs or events to limit, or decrease, the amount of car usage in that area. 
1486	not using cars is better for the environment 
1487	that it allows the city to improve itself.  
1488	In recent years, the environment has become a worldwide concern; one of the advantages to limiting car usage is that it will positively impact the environment. 
1489	"people all over the world are paying attention to what they can do to help the environment, meaning that this is an advantage that will appeal to a widespread audience. One way that limiting car usage will help is that it will reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In Elisabeth Rosenthal's essay ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", she writes, ""Passenger cars are responsible for 2 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe ... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"". By limiting the usage of cars, the amount of greenhouse gases being emitted into the world would decrease substantially. While the idea that everyone would stop using their cars and the gas emissions caused by them would disappear completely is unrealistic, the prospect that a majority of the emissions could do so is perfectly reasonable. The reduction of these emissions would mean that the air quality would increase and be overall healthier for both all the world's population and all the wildlife across the world. Robert Duffer provides another example of how less car usage would impact the environment in his essay, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"". According to the article, an intense smog had covered Paris for five days, when the city decided to ban car usage over the course of two days. The cause for the smog was thought to be the high use of diesel fuel in France, with 67 percent of cars using it over gasoline, about 14 percent higher than the rest of Western Europe. The plan for the ban had been that cars with even-numbered license plates to not be used the first day and for ones with odd-numbered license plates not to be used the next day. In actuality, cars with odd-numbered plates were never banned from driving since the smog had cleared just after the first day. This shows the impact of limiting car usage. In just one day, a smog that was comarable to the one in Beijing, China, one of the most polluted cities in the world, was removed considerably after just half the normal amount of cars were used over the course of a day. If this was used all over the world, the result would be even more significant. This evidence supports that limiting car use is good for the environment in more ways than one. "
1490	Additionally, the limited use of cars opens many opportunities for cities to improve themselves by adding new features or improving upon old ones. 
1491	"In the article ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky, the changes that the Columbian city of Bogota has gone through in response to less car use are discussed. The changes are a direct result of the city's Day Without Cars campaign, where car use is banned for the whole city for one day out of a year. It reads, ""It has seen the construction of 118 mile of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city's mayor. Parks and sports centers have also bloomed throughout the city;uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up"".  These additions are in response to the city's inhabitants using alternative transport. Since cars could not be used, the public had to get to where they were heading by other means. Bogota was able to use the situation to improve itself by either fixing things already in place or adding new ones competely. Another way that a city improved itself as a result of limited car use is shown by Elisabeth Rosenthal in her essay ""In German Suburn Life Goes On Without Cars"". She writes, ""While there have been efforts in the past two decades to make cities denser, and better for walking, planners are now taking the concept to the suburbs"". One of the results of applying this idea to suburbs is that stores are placed within walking distance of houses rather than in a mall next to a highway. Vauban, the city where the changes took place, is taking advantage of the opportunities to open new stores. This change would not only create more business for the strore itself but improve the economy of the city by increasing spending. The overall impact that limiting car use has had on citites is that it provides opportunity for the city to improve itself.  "
1492	"From Monster trucks to Volkswagen Beetles, all automobiles are created to make life easier for people from all corners of the Earth. Many people start up their cars everyday without a second thought, whether trekking across the street or across the country. Others believe that cars are ruining the Earth, and put effort toward decreasing their car's ""footprint"" on the environment. "
1493	"According to Source Two, Paris, a city known for it's aromatic scents, was covered with the smell and appearance of smog for days (they had near-record pollution: Paris had 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter compared with 114 in Brussels and 79.7 in London). After a day in which all even-numbered license plates were banned from the streets of Paris, the smog cleared up a great amount (enough for the city officials to take the ban they had placed for odd numbered license plates the next day). The smog that was affecting the well-being of Paris' citizens had mostly disappeared after only one day of limited car use. If a community limits cars, its inhabitants will be almost forced to exercise more. According to Source 3, in Bogota, Colombia, where a ""Day Without Cars"" is held yearly, 118 miles of bike paths have been constructed, the most of any Latin American city. Less cars on the road in this city have led to other means of transportation being more popular, including walking and bicycling. These ways of getting around are much more healthy then their gas-powered alternative. Less traffic on roads will therefore leave cities healthier than otherwise.  "
1494	Additionally, having student-designed projects will boost the amount of kids who complete the projects. 
1495	To start, student-designed projects should be given to students because they let students creativity shine 
1496	Creativity is an important part of every child's life, not being able to use it will make a child dull. For example, when someone does not practice or use something they often lose their ability to do it. Additionally, student-designed projects would let students show who they really are and what they enjoy. When students can show who they really are they feel happy and good about themselves. Also, when they can express what they enjoy they will attract other classmates that enjoy the same thing. Having friends that enjoy the same thing they do will not only improve their happiness but will also improve their work ethic towards what they enjoy. For example, I am in very demanding and somewhat difficult classes. Having friends in the same classes as me with the same goals makes it a lot easier. Without them I would most likely not work nearly as hard. 
1497	To add, student-designed projects should be given to students because they will increase the amount of kids that will complete the project. 
1498	When students are forced to complete something they do not enjoy some people just will not do it. If students enjoy the project and look forward to it many more will complete it. For example, I have been assigned many projects during my life. When a teacher gives the students more than one way they can do the project it always has more submissions than if it was only an essay. Specifically, after reading a book, my class had to do a final report. When the teacher gave us options such as a: poster, essay, picture, or model it had many submissions. 
1499	To contrast, many people would say that having student-designed projects would allow students to not work as hard as they would if they had teacher-designed projects 
1500	What they did not consider is that it is summer break and that most students would not be working hard anyways. To add, having student-designed projects would allow the students to be more enthusiastic about the project and work harder. If you expect students to work hard during summer why even have a summer break? It does not make any sense to give students a break that they still need to work during. 
1501	In conclusion, summer projects should be student-designed because they will allow kids to show their creativity, and they will increase the amount of students who complete them. Giving students something they can choose will ultimately increase students work ethic and view of school. 
1502	Letting the student choose their own assignment is a wonderful idea because what they choose is likely something they won't have a hard time completing and they're also still getting some sort of education. 
1503	Student's can still have fun over the summer while learning and preparing for the upcoming year. 
1504	A student-designed project could also let the student work on their own time and pace because during the summer most people are out on vacation and don't have time to complete schoolwork. 
1505	Student-designed summer assignment's would result in a relaxed, but still productive and educational summer that will help better prepare student's in the upcoming school year. 
1506	Summer project's should be assigned by teacher's and not student's because of the lack effort the student's will put forth. 
1507	Having to do schoolwork over the summer is one thing, but making the work student-assigned is whole different ballgame. If the student chose what assignment's they would have to complete over the summer they most likely wouldn't finish it or not even look at it let alone take it out of their book bags. Teacher-assigned assignment's would make the student have to remember what to get done and when to have it done by or there will be consequence's. As a student they may not be fond of it but what it's doing is keeping them learning over the summer and starting them off nicely with solid grades in the upcoming school year. Think about this, during the school year if homework was optional who would do it? Now if a teacher assigned everyone homework and told them to have it done by a certain date for a grade, then see how many student's would complete their homework. It's night and day and the same thing applies in this case. 
1508	Put yourself in a young students' shoes, you're in school for nine months and you finally can relax, go home, and just enjoy your time off because you did great during the school year and you deserve it. Then your teacher mentions summer assignment's that will be designed by him or her. The assignment's will likely be a load and it all has to be completed by a certain date. That's just completely unfair, because you work hard all year just to get time to relax and you can't. It's probably very overwhelming and young students need time to take a break and have fun especially after the long nine month slog they call school. 
1509	Allowing the student to choose their own assignment's over the summer is great because they have no excuse to not get it done. 
1510	The effort given in a teacher-designed assignment versus a student-designed assignment would be completely different. You're likely thinking a student won't do their work if it was up to them and not the teacher, 
1511	A student-designed project would not only get them more prepared for the year ahead but would also give the kid's time to enjoy their summer and also learn at the same time. 
1512	Lastly, student-designed summer assignments would result in a relaxed, but still productive and educational summer that will help better prepare student's in the upcoming school year. 
1513	Having children partake in extra curricular activities can help your children, become more sociable, and become more involved in their schools. After school programs are also very good at helping new students become more integrated into the school system. By partaking in extracurricular activities you can meet new people and gain great experiences. By having your children participate in extracurricular activities like, sports teams, or student run organizations, the experiences you could gain could potentially be very rewarding for your later years. 
1514	"Children all over the world participate in extracurricular group activities. For example young children in Switzerland have little after school groups called ""Horts"" where they eat together, clean together, finish homework together, and play together. Those ""Horts"" can form life-long friendships and form even closer bonds to their classmates. I think by implementing those same practices we can help future generations become even more tight knit and overall become much closer. So instead of eating alone at lunch and being sad, your child would have a much happier lunch with good friends and a much tighter knit school community. "
1515	by partaking in extracurricular activities, your child can form stronger bonds, stronger friendships, and even new friends as well.  
1516	extracurricular activities can help children relax, and in some circumstances, they could potentially help children improve their grades. 
1517	one of the best stress relieving thing you can do is to exercise, but most people don't like to exercise because they don't think its fun. But if you exercise with friends, then it can be really fun, because generally everything you do with friends is more fun than doing anything alone. So by joining a sports team you get to relieve your stress, by exercising and you get to have fun with some friends. Also if you happen to be super talented when it comes to your sport you could even get offers to play college and you could potentially even receive scholarships. But if you want to receive good scholarships you must also be a good student, now generally most schools offer tutoring or homework clubs which can be very helpful if you want to improve your grades. So in general after curricular activities can help improve your grades and can help you feel more relaxed. 
1518	"Now some people may ask, ""What if my child doesn't like sports?"" "
1519	You can tell them that not all after school activities are sports related, and so instead of making your kids play sports try letting them pick what they want to do. There are so many good clubs and organizations to join in school so why not take advantage of it? For example you could join the yearbook committee or join student council, there are so many options we could keep going forever. Now what if your child does not like any of the extracurricular activities? Schools are great places to try new things, just because your child has never done something before does not mean they won't necessarily like it. So before you jump the gun and say you child does not like something maybe let them explore their options first. 
1520	I believe that all students should participate in extracurricular activities because they can help children like me discover who they are.  
1521	I believe that it could be a good way for the students to find new friends with the same interests as them. Students could also try to find clubs that catch their interest 
1522	Staying after school for clubs could get kids off of there phones, and help them to stay active. 
1523	the students get an opportunity to do the things they like, that they may not have the opportunity to do at school or at home. 
1524	The students will make new friends because they all have at least one thing in common with each other. If they were to hang out more, then they could start to find out that they have a lot more in common. Making new friends at that activity will make the students want to go back to that activity so they can see their friends again. This would go perfectly with the idea that the principal had. The student wants to go to something that the principal is telling them that they have to go to. This gives the principal what they want, and it gives the students what they want. 
1525	Usually when students get home from school, they use their time being on their phone or playing video games. When they go to an after school activity, they use some of their free time constructively. If the student went to the sports club, then they would get more physical exercise. If the student does yearbook, then they get to learn about different activities going on throughout the school. If the student participates in the student council, then that student gets to help the community through service projects. All of those clubs provide better use of the students time, rather than just sitting at home doing nothing. If the students actually enjoy cutting back on devices, then would try to manage their time so they are staying away from screens and doing something that is stimulative. 
1526	Some students don't have enough hobbies, if they even have any at all. Making them choose an activity could possibly interest them in whatever they chose, and they would start to take up that activity as a hobby. 
1527	Now that the student has a hobby, that student will most likely spend time doing that hobby instead of doing the other activities that keep the student from being productive. The student will now think that if he gives something new a try, they will enjoy whatever it the new activity is. Now he will want to do other new activities that exercise either his body or his mind. Soon his free time will be filled with the hobbies that are good for him and not the time wasting ones. 
1528	If the student already enjoys one of the activities provided, then it gives the student an opportunity to participate in that activity. Sometimes students just can't find time in their busy schedules to do the things that they enjoy. Staying after school would be the perfect time for that student to do the activity that they want to do. Maybe the student wasn't selected for the yearbook elective in school, but because there is a yearbook activity after school; that student can now do yearbook like she wanted to. Some parents can't afford for their child to do certain activities like play a sport. If there was an opportunity for the students to stay after to do a sport for free, they would take it. The student gets to do something that they have always wanted to do, but that their parents could never afford. 
1529	it is true that people without cars would have to go through the rain or the cold weather every time the weather looks ominous and people would have to worry about getting to school or work on time. 
1530	But, Limiting or taking away cars would clear the air of smog and less people would have stress. 
1531	by limiting car usage you can reduce smog. 
1532	"""After says of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city""(Duffer, ""Paris bans driving due to smog""). If all cars or vehicles were to stop being used the air would clear easily and we can all live in clear air. ""The smog cleard enough Monday for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on Tuesday""(Duffer, ""Paris bans driving due to smog""). If they made like a schedule for which days cars will be banned and what days aren't, then the air we breathe will be better than ever and everyone will still be able to use there cars how they feel like. "
1533	"""It's a good opportuntiy to take away stress and lower air pollution, ""said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza as he rode a two-seat bicycle wiht his wife""(Selsky, ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota""). Without cars theres people walking along the side walks talking, people not having to worry about saftey on the road as much, people riding bicycles and skateboarding, and just a great way to excerise just by walking outside. ""The rain hasn't stopped people from participating,' said bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus""(Selsky, ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota""). The fact that people dont care about the rain makes me think that people are enjoying this car-free day and there's no reason to stop it. "
1534	A few days or even weeks without cars is a great idea for reducing stress and air pollution. There are even more reasons why we should have a car-free day like time conservation, emission lowerage, safety improvement, and resource conservation.  
1535	In my opinion I agree that the school should provide a variety of athletic and academic activities at or after school. I would highly recommend this to all schools. 
1536	Not only should students be as smart as they are, but that students should have the ability to choose at least one activity that they would love to do. 
1537	a teacher designed, but creative assignment, would be most beneficial to students' learning curve over the summer. By assigning something creative with educational merit, 
1538	students would enjoy working during their free time, 
1539	learn new things, 
1540	prevent losing knowledge they have gained while they are on their summer vacation. 
1541	If a student is assigned something they find boring, they are less likely to try as hard as they would on a more creative assignment. Also, if the assignment is more open to interpretation, it helps students think more creatively. Students would be much more likely to complete, and better yet, enjoy assignments that they find creative and fun. Meanwhile, a student with a duller assingment would not put their entire effort into it, and would surely rather be enjoying their vacation. By making the assignment itself more enjoyable, students would be 10 times more interested and likely to enjoy it.  
1542	Though the creativity of the assingment is paramount, the educational value of the assignment is just as important. 
1543	In order to make sure that students can actually enjoy their projects, leaving it open to some interpretation can help a diverse set of students come up with individual ideas for their assignment. 
1544	By making summer assignments creative, but still educational, teachers can prevent students from getting out of the educational mindset over their break, as well as help them enjoy their work as much as they enjoy their time out of school. Therefore, summer assignments should be designed by teachers, but still have room for creative and original ideas that will help the students enjoy their work and their individuality as they complete their summer work. 
1545	"A planet that has enough heat and pressure to melt most metals and crush any submarine may not sound like an ideal location to visit, but scientists at NASA are determined on researching it because even though it has horribly immense climate, it may be the closest planet in our solar system to Earth. The article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author speaks of how scientists strongly believe that learning more about Venus can lead to answers about the creation of Earth. It is an extremely difficult task to accomplish, as most rovers NASA has sent there have not lasted more than a mere few hours. In order to research the planet in depth, NASA would need to send living humans to Venus, however, this will be rediculously challenging and even more so dangerous. "
1546	Venus may have one of the harshest climates in our solar system, with an average temperature of 800 degrees Farenheit, and an atmospheric pressure 90 times greater than Earth's. Despite these major differences, it is also believed to be the closest to Earth by means of geological similarity. As stated in the article, scientists believe that Venus was most likely covered with oceans and quite possibly could have even hosted life. This idea is gathered from the similarities in structures between Earth and that volcano of a planet, like valleys, mountains, and an atmosphere. 
1547	All of these facts are provide the possibility of being able to make human contact on Venus. Not only would that allow scientist to further research what Earth may become, but if humans are able to reside on another planet, it would greatly help rid overcrowding and Venus may be a future inhabitable location for humans.  
1548	Obviously, the idea of sending humans to Venus far excedes our current technology, but traveling to that planet may be the future of humanity. 
1549	The author states that the value of returning to Venus is indesputable, yet horribly dangerous. Danger should not put off scientists into further discovering that planet, but rather it should encourage them to work even harder in order to someday provide a safe passage between Earth and Venus. This would be beneficial to human society, because it could potentially help rid future problems of overpopulation and even provide insight on what Earth may become. 
1550	The principal has decided that every student must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. For example, a student could participate in sports, work in the yearbook committee, or serve on the student council. This decision should be slightly changed so that it only applies to the students who do not participate in an extracurricular activity of any kind. 
1551	After all, extracurricular activities are beneficial to students 
1552	they perform better in the classroom as a result, colleges look favorably upon students who participate in extracurricular activities, 
1553	these activities improve the health of teenagers. 
1554	They are capable of thinking more creatively about certain questions, are more comfortable and as a result better when giving presentations in front of the class, and cna even perform better in Physical Education. Extracurricular activities, while not solely responsible for this, are a large factor that affects how a student performs in the classroom. For example, Model United Nations is one activity which teaches students about various useful skills, like public speaking. Students stand up in front of the entire class giving a speech, sometimes off the top of their head, on a certain problem affecting the intense world today. Model UN is not only a useful educational tool, however, as it is also capable of helping students think about the world with a new perspective. Many topics given are about finding better solutions to certain issues prevalent in today's world. Students come out of this club brimming with new ideas, self-confidence, and a will to learn. Sports are another activity beneficial to students. They learn skills such as teamwork, cooperation, and even get better sleep at night. One example of this is soccer, which teaches students about endurance and teamwork, all while helping them exercise. These student athletes are able to perform better in the classroom as well as in P.E. because of their athletic capabilities.  College is a big part of life not just in the United States, but all over the world. By going to college, one can get a better education and in turn, a better job. However, just getting good grades in school is not enough for many of the top colleges around the world. Students also need a hook that make them stand out from the others in the eyes of the university. In fact, some colleges have given out scholarships to students for extracurricular activities. For example, playing a musical instrument, like the piano. Not only does this help with how a student does in the classroom, but colleges also look for students with musical talents and even partner with music schools for this purpose. In this way, not only can students attend a college, but they can also attend the music school that comes with it and pursue their musical education as well. 
1555	Obesity and depression can both be linked to overworking students and not giving them enough time to go do something else. This is why schools need extracurricular activities. Sports and music are both helpful in this way. At a young age, many children are encouraged to go outside and participate in their local sports team by their parents. The parents do this so the children can get exercise and grow up leading a healthier lifestyle which combines academics and physical activity. Team sports, like soccer, football, or basketball, also teach students about teamwork and build up their self-confidence, which benefits their mental health as well. Team members meet each other just about every week, and over time, this relationship builds into a friendship. Individuals can feel that they belong in the team and treat almost like a second family. This sense of belonging benefits their mental health, which in turn benefits their performance in the classroom, which benefits their life overall. 
1556	However, the specific decision of the principal should be changed as students may already participate in extracurricular activities not provided by the school. 
1557	For example, one may take piano lessons with a private teacher, or play on a travel soccer team with no association to the school. By forcing these students to have to pick up another extracurricular activity that is provided by the school, they may become overwhelmed with trying to manage their busy schedules. Then, all of the positive attributes of physical activities fall apart. This reason is why the decision of the principal should be changed so that only students who do not participate in any extracurricular activity of any kind will be required to take one. Otherwise, there will be drawbacks to the principal's otherwise good intentions. 
1558	the decision of the principal, while beneficial to the students, shouild be slightly changed so that students who already partcipate in an extracurricular activity outside of school will not be required to take one provided by the school. Extracurricular activities are beneficial to students because they improve performance in the classroom, help them pursue higher education, and improve their physical and mental health overall. Students should be given every opportunity to succeed, but requiring every student to participate in a school-based extracurricular activity would not be fair to the students who do so outside of school. They may experience certain drawbacks as a result of the tremendous workload forced upon them, and this may also lead to weakened mental health. For this reason, the principal's decision should be changed such that it only applies to students who do not partcipate in extracurricular activites of any kind. 
1559	it can be more enjoyable and creative. 
1560	Nobody looks forward to wasting their summer working on a school project when the whole point of break is to get away from school and work. 
1561	It gives them the opportunity to think of cool ideas and to build off of them. Students will be more motivated to do the project if they get to choose the layout of it and design it all by themselves. When teachers give young adults the chance to do their own project, it makes every bodies project more diverse so a lot of people will not have the same ideas or layouts. Student-designed projects give young people more freedom and opens their minds up to the world of new ideas. 
1562	after having to go to school and doing work on a day-to-day basis, for about ten months, is exhausting. Once students finally get out of school, they feel freedom. Having a whole two and a half to three months of no school, no waking up early, and no assignments, is one of the best feelings ever. 
1563	teachers may disagree with these statements because they want projects that are easier to grade and go over. If a teacher is receiving over one hundred summer projects that were student-designed, he or she may feel overwhelmed and it may take a longer time to grade. All teachers teach differently, just like all students learn differently, so having teacher-designed projects for over the summer can be a simpler task for the teacher. Although teachers want students to learn over break by doing projects, I am sure they want a break too from grading papers and assignments or being flooded with them once school starts back up again. 
1564	The end of each school year is the most exciting time for a lot students and teachers because it is finally break time. Having students continue to learn and refresh their memory over the summer should be a student-designed project so they have the chance to thinks of new ideas and be creative, while also completing the given task. Most students learn differently in many diverse ways, so having the option for a student to design their own projects with certain requirements, makes it a lot more motivational for the students and to open their minds to greater extents.  
1565	"In paragraph 7, it says, ""some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."" This shows that they are already testing new methods that could possibly survive on Venus. In paragraph 7, it says, ""Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers...system that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces."" This proves that they are using all resources that even date back to the 1800s. "
1566	students would be more inclined to do them 
1567	it would be enjoyable. 
1568	In my experiences, if my mom told me to do something I didn't want to do I would not do it to the best of my abilities. However, if I choose what to do it wouldn't feel as a 'must' but rather a 'want,' so I would take my time doing it. Students would have a good time doing a project they are interested in; they would be excited when working on it. Having excitement while doing projects helps you do better on them. 
1569	Having these project be student-designed would make the students feel as if it wasn't a school assignment that they had to do on their summer break. I typically don't want to do school work during my breaks; so, if I had to choose what topic I would be working on, it would be more enjoyable for me. I will still be learning of course but I would be working on something I am interested in. Most projects that are teacher-designed that I get assigned to don't interest me, I dread doing them. 
1570	If these projects were student-designed it would insure student learning, while also having fun during summer. 
1571	Some people however, may believe the students would not complete the projects if it was student-designed. If the students did not know what to choose for their projects they may not even bother to do it. 
1572	Having to pick something for myself and not knowing what to do typically frustrates me and make me feel as if I don't want to do it. Having that much freedom may be too much for the students that often don't do their work. Restricting the projects to be teacher-designed will ensure the students to complete the projects and continue learning during their summer breaks. 
1573	In my town getting your license is a huge deal. As soon as I turned fifteen I went streight to the DMV to take my test and get to driving as soon as possible. In countries and cities such as Germany, France, and Bogota, driving is ban pretty much where ever you go. After days of near-record pollution,paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city and as a result congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog. Smog flooded Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the entire world. 
1574	The consequences that cars toll people with today are greatly weighing on an individuals daily life. They have their schedule built around their car and are constantly being time constrained because of it. The effect greenhouse gases have on the Earth is huge and has not stopped. In order to help the Earth in this parituclar topic, this action would be miraculous. Not only do many people become lazy and very unhealthy because of cars, but they also take for granted what they can do without them. Hiking and other activities are missed out on the daily because of these vehicles. Many people can accomplish new goals and set new goals if it were not for certain transportation methods.                             
1575	The responsibility of designing a project that is forced upon students during their time off should be held by teachers. 
1576	When it comes to summer activities, completing a school project isn't one that comes to mind. If students are being required to do a project, then teachers should be the ones to design it. Creating projects and lesson plans, assigning work, etc. is all apart of a teacher's job. As employees of schools that require a summer project, teachers, rather than students, should be in control of the project elements. Doing this will give teachers the opportunity to have say in what their students are learning. 
1577	Being forced to complete a task, especially during a time intended for relaxation, will only result in sloppy work being done. 
1578	Although the project is intended for the continuation of learning, students are more likely to design their projects to be as simple as possible. Given the circumstance of it being summer and having to complete a project which is under their observation, students will do the bare minimum amount of work. The same cannot be said if it was created by a teacher. In addition, students are more likely to complete the project solely for the grade rather than the learning experience; defeating the whole purpose of assigning a summer project. 
1579	The burden of having an entire project to do over the course of summer is the last thing students want. This task is forced upon them by their schools. Therefore, educators should be accounted for having a well designed project to assign to students. The students already have extra, unwanted work to complete. They shouldn't have to be given the additional stress of having to design their own projects.  
1580	What is so special about texting and driving? Is the person you're texting more valuable than your life? These are the two questions you should ask yourself before picking up your phone while you are behind the wheel. The statistics are out of this world people are dying every day because of distracted drivers. 
1581	Texting and driving is very dangerous because during the time you check your phone your brain cells reaction time slows down and it causes a potential accident. 
1582	In 2018 4,637 people died in car crashes due to cell phone use. 
1583	as 69 percent of U.S. drivers between the ages of 18 and 64 admitted to using their cell phone while driving during the previous month. Texting increases a crash by 23 times, it's a habit that must be stopped, across age groups and geographic locations alike. 40 percent of teens state that they've been in the car with a car with someone who was diving when using their cell phone in a way that put them in some kind of danger. While the maximum amount of time a driver can safely can change their attention from the road from is two seconds, it takes a driver five seconds on average to send a text message. 
1584	Besides talking to your teen regularly about this issue and setting a good example by not using your cell phone while driving yourself, there are other simple ways to monitor your teen's phone use while they're behind the wheel. Start by activating smartphone features that help prohibit texting while driving. We need to take advantage of technology, utilizing apps that allow you as the parent more transparency into your child's whereabouts and driving habits. 
1585	In this generations words don't mean anything. Signs don't mean anything. There are signs everywhere that say don't text and drive but due to the research nobody is listening. Companies are trying to go around this rule by making a profit. What I mean by that is we say don't text and drive but here's an example apple air pods you simply tap your ear and say text so and so and in an instant your message has been sent to whoever. I don't think that's safe either in no way is texting and driving safe. 
1586	If you take your eyes off the road for even a second, the most dreadful things could happen. To many people die for that one text back that could have waited until you stopped or could have waited until you got to a red light. Many teenagers don't know that you could ruin your in literally 5 seconds. 
1587	There is one case in which your life can be saved when texting and driving. There is a law called the hands free law. 
1588	Texting and driving could either be paid with your life or a ticket. 
1589	In Georgia, the texting and driving ticket is the highest in the nation. If you get caught in Georgia that is a $150 ticket for violating the distracted driving law as well as one point on your driving record. The highest ticket you could be fined to is $1,000 in Iowa I think you're better off just following the hands free law. More money you get to keep in your pocket. Then to think about if you're texting and driving there's a possibility of you losing your life and a possibility of you killing someone else. 
1590	In conclusion, Texting and driving is very dangerous but tempting. Teenagers are the most tempted to text and drive. 
1591	One reason students should be forced to take at least one school activity is some students after school just go home immediately to watch television or use their phones,the reason this is a problem is because that isn't good for their heath 
1592	the reason being is, while students are doing an activity they are going to feel motivated to win or have their team win. Another reason is students will start to do things more organized or on time the reason being is, now that they have some motivation from doing an activity when it comes to doing this they are supposed to do, they might do it better. The final reason is students who don't have respect can most likely gain it the reason being is, when being motivated your behavior changes really quickly, so people who have no respect might gain it. 
1593	The reason some people might not think it's a good idea for students to have to participate in one school activity is some students might be stressed if their forced to do an activity they don't want to do, the reason being is, some people have social anxiety this means when put around people they tend to get uncomfortable, nervous, and maybe even cry because they have no clue what to say. 
1594	One thing that connects students and schools all over the nation are the wide range of fun and interesting after school programs, known as extracurriculars. Schools offer lots of extracurricular programs that interest students hobbies and talents from sports, such as football or basketball, to clubs that help out and benefit the school, such as school council or leadership and unique clubs that students share a common interest in such as Harry Potter club or running club. 
1595	Although extracurricular activities are just as beneficial to a students educational experience as in-school classes, students should be able to have the option to choose whether they would wish to participate in the activities. 
1596	Forcing a student to participate and serve in these extracurricular programs will deter the quality of the programs 
1597	make students even busier than they already are, leaving them no time for other activities outside of school. 
1598	If the option to opt out of joining an extra program is stripped from students, the qualities of the clubs can and will decrease 
1599	If a student chooses to participate in an extracurricular on their own time, the student will be excited and enthusiastic to engage in the program. Whereas if a student is forced to participate in a club or program, they will be the opposite, and likely will be put in a negative mindset where they believe that they are forced to be there. It's important for students to have the choice to participate to where students feel enthusiastic about the club and happy to be there.  
1600	Requiring students to join an extra activity at the end of the day will also create unhappiness among students. 
1601	Students are already required to be at school and work for 7 hours a day and 35 hours a week. The extra activities at the end of the day can add on up to 4 hours of extra time to the already long school day, making it up to 50 hours per week. Some sports practices even go until 7:30 PM and also require students to meet on the weekends. Students are already exhausted and unhappy with the current school day, and forcing an extra 15 hours a week will have a devastating effect on the previously unhappy students. 
1602	Many students are involved in extracurricular activities that are not school sponsored and are run by an organization outside of school. If school forces the students to join an activity, it will take up more time. 
1603	It will leave students with no time for their other not-school related activities, yet another forced school related thing taking time out of the day that isn't school. Forcing students to join a club will create the same effect homework has on students. They will form a hatred for clubs, just like many students have for homework, because it leaves them with less and less out of school time. 
1604	In conclusion, schools should not allow students to choose whether they would like to participate in extracurricular activities because it can decrease the quality of the clubs, create unhappiness among students, and cause students to be even more busy and leaving students unavailable for other non-school related activities. Giving students the freedom to be able to choose whether they would like to participate lets students have more power. Taking away that power and putting just another thing thats forced on to their plate will cause students even more stress and discomfort.  
1605	From the crammed streets of New York City, to the tourist-filled city of Paris, cars have been the means of transportation around the globe ever since their creation. The reliance on cars has been an issue too great to ignore, as the environment becomes more polluted and the streets become more dangerous. We must shed light on the dark tunnel that has been blinding our judgement to a brighter future, where pollution is limited and our streets are clean. That future can only be seen with limiting car usage. 
1606	it would better the environment 
1607	it would create a better lifestyle around the world.  
1608	"With global warming increasing by the day, any step to reduce pollution and greenhouse gases should be taken, limiting car usage is an essential tool to head in that direction. As a Elisabeth Rosenthal from the New York Times expounded: ""Passanger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" Clearly cars are extremely harmful to the environment. However there is hope, because once car usage is limited these high numbers can be mitigated everywhere. In fact, in Paris, as Robert Duffer from the Chicago Tribune reported, policies to lower car usage have been taken and have actually worked! In France's capital ""motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine. The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day."" In hopes to reduce carbon emmissions and save the environment, Paris's prayers were answered as the smog cleared enough for the government to remove the ban for odd-numbered plates. Clearly, the pollution reduced due to one factor--limiting car usage. If actions around the world are initiated similar to Paris's plan, then a better environmental future is inevitable. The environmental benefits of reducing car usage are endless. After all we only have one planet, cars should not be the machines to dictate our environmental future. "
1609	"Reliance on cars has shaped modern society into a dependent state on oil. However, once that oil runs out, what type of lifestyle will people turn to? Limiting car usage provides this answer through a healthy lifestyle before this day arises. For example, In Bogota, Colombia, as Andrew Selsky from the Seattle Times put it: ""the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths"" had been built within Bogota after years of limiting cars. People are shifting their reliance on cars and turning them into productive means of transportation. In fact, rush hour restrictions cut traffic and has led to a rise in parks and shopping districts in Bogota, according to Mr Selsky. Even Carlos Arturo Plaza a businessman in Bogota enthusiastically exclaimed: ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress..."" as he rode a two seat bicycle with his wife. However, Bogota is not the only place where limiting car usage has been gaining support, the Mobile World Congress has been engaged too! Bill Ford, the executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company laid out his plan where he envisioned a ""world in which personal vehicle ownership is impractical or undesriable,"" (Rosenthal). He believed that ""partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emission and improve safety"" (Rosenthal). If people around the globe are willing to support this movement, especially a chairman for one of the world's largest automotive companies, and partake in this new lifestyle, then limiting car usage must be the way to go. This new lifestyle of riding bikes, walking, and taking public transportation, will mold the traditional transportation mediums, into a more safe and secure one if citizens support this advantageous movement. "
1610	Participating in an extracurricular activity for school may be a lot of fun for example, yearbook club, sports, or gaming clubs. But going to a after school activity everyday can be a lot and extracurricular activities may not be in everybody's field. 
1611	The principal should not force all students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity 
1612	Sometimes teachers may assign a lot of homework to their students. Sometimes if students have multiple teachers, the students may have homework from different subjects. Or students may have to finish classwork that they did not finish from class. Also projects can keep a student busy because students may have from 1 to 2 projects to do at home. Study guides also play a role because students may have upcoming test, quizzes, benchmarks, and midterms to pass. Some parents may own a restaurant or a shop and their kids may have to work at the restaurant or shop. students can also have tutoring, babysitting, other sports, and taking care of a loved one. However there are many more things that can keep a student busy after school. 
1613	With some of these things going on in a students life it can be overwhelming by adding an extracurricular activity to their busy schedules. This is why the principal should not force the students to participate in an extracurricular activity. 
1614	Students can be tired form the long 7 hours of school in the daytime 
1615	Some students may want to go straight home from school to go eat and take a nap. Also when some students are testing all day they may want to go home and relax. However if the principal forces students to participate in extracurricular activities then they will be even more exhausted by staying after school for the clubs or sports. Some students may not want to stay at school for an extra 1 to 3 hours just for a extracurricular activity. students may have made plans to hang out with friends or go out to the mall. However if they are forced to stay after school then they would have to change their plans. This is another reason why the principal should not force students to participate in extracurricular activities. 
1616	Not all students are interested in the activities at the school. 
1617	The activities at school may not be so enjoyable for the students. Some of the clubs that the students are interested in may not be available at the school. This is why the principal should make clubs that the students would love for example, a fan club for a popular book, a dodge ball club, or a health club. Fun clubs like these are what will make the students enjoy the clubs. But having boring clubs at school like yearbook club can be boring. Also adding fun sports to school like gymnastics or cricket would also bring the students happiness and would make them want to do extracurricular activities instead of the principal focing the students to participate. 
1618	As a result, students are busy after school, students are exhausted from long school days, and students are not interested in the activities at school are all reasons why the principal should not force students to participate in extracurricular activities. Students have lots of other things to do after school, students want to go home after a long 7 hours of school and do not want to be at school for another 1 to 3 hours, and lastly students are not interested in the extracurricular activities at school because they are boring.                               
1619	Summer projects are something to make sure students keep learning over their break. It's clear to see that teacher-designed projects are much more efficient. Without the guidance of teachers, students could make simplistic projects that offer no benefit for the teacher or student. The teacher's knowledge about the project could make it helpful for their students to keep learning different ways about the material. It is also common for students to forget or lose interest when they are given too much responsibility for an assignment. Student-designed projects can leave room for a large quantity of errors and mistakes that could ultimately defeat the purpose of a project. Therefore, teacher- designed projects are better in the sense that they can keep the student learning as if they are still in school but give them time to enjoy the benefits that come with summer break.           
1620	Everyday people die in car accidents because they use cell phones while driving. According to research cell phones are leading factors that cause accidents. Studies show that a cell phone put drivers at a four time greater risk of a crush. Despite of a danger, people still use cell phones because they want to be always available and keep in touch with other people. Also, they think that hand-free set is safe because they can drive using two hands. Moreover, they use arguments that cell phones are necessary in emergency situations. 
1621	Although some people support using cell phones while driving, there are evidences that they are dangerous and people should avoid talking while driving. 
1622	students would still be able to enjoy their summer with a project of their choosing, 
1623	students will be able to display their creativity in their project, 
1624	students will finally be able to design their project after a school year of teacher-designed projects. 
1625	 Summer projects should be student-designed because students would still be able to enjoy their summer with a project of their choosing. 
1626	Students could enjoy their summer with this project because they are doing something they're passionate about. This will benefit students because they tend to put more effort into something they want to do. Also for students doing something they want to do, they strive to succeed and they'll choose something that they're comfortable with. In addition students could still enjoy their summer because of the stress it takes off of the student for them not having to go out of their comfort zone to complete another project subject that they have no clue about. The stress taken off students for the summer is beneficial because it gives them an energetic start to the next school year. 
1627	In addition summer projects should be student-designed because students will be able to display their creativity in their project. 
1628	Finally summer projects should be student-designed because students will finally be able to design their project after a school year of teacher-designed projects. 
1629	With limited extra work and limited research it may make one think that they're not really learning, 
1630	In conclusion it would be beneficial to both students and teachers if summer projects were student-designed because it will remain that students still have an exciting summer while being creative and finally being able to do a student-designed project. So therefore during the summer the only projects that are given should be student-designed so that it will remain intact for students to have a stress free summer for while they're still completing academic activity.                       
1631	Summer break has always been an important time for students to relax, spend more time bonding with their families, and travel to new places. Although summer is typically a nice and warm few months for destressing, I know that my summer is always packed with sports, trips, and visits from family. But what if the kids return back to school having completely cut off their school learning for 3 months? Schools then add teacher organized projects to the agenda, meaning for families there is always a week or more at the end of summer where everyone is cramming to get all their project work done. This almost constantly leads to less time to enjoy the end of summer, parents having to be involved, and unfocused, rushed work being handed in on the first day of school. However, there is a solution: Students design and lead their own projects, based off their own interests and activities. Letting students lead their own projects still assures that they are spending time learning, but eliminates several of the negative factors. 
1632	Student-designed projects where kids can do a project that pertains to their certain hobbies and summer adventures are better than teacher-designed projects  
1633	kids would be more enthusiastic about the work 
1634	parents would be less involved, 
1635	the learning they would be doing is more valuable overall. 
1636	Last summer, I went to Italy and got to visit cities I had never imagined, learning so much about the history and culture. My summer assignments meant that once I got the the hotel, I wasn't napping ro relaxing, but up working on homework. It was uninteresting to me and tedious. If only I designed my own projects, then I could share with the teachers and school all the fascinating discovies I was making about Italy, and instead of sitting alone while my family was resting for our next excursion, record my beautiful day and turn it into a project that made sure my mind and writing and creative skills stayed fresh. I know that not every kid gets to go on a trip to Italy 
1637	Another reason that student-designed projects would be more beneficial is that typically, when kids are confused about their teacher-assigned project or need assistance, it is necessary for the parents to be involved. The age effects this as well, because some young elementary schoolers may be incapable of staying focused on the project without support. For most adults summer break still means going to work everyday unless they are out of town. Since there isn't teacher access at home, the parents get pulled into doing way more of the projec than they should, whether the kid is just disinterested or struggling ont heir own. 
1638	Children are much more likely to be passionate about their own projects if they feel as if it is uniquely their own. The research and skills would go in to more depth with more focus, for example, if I got to write about what I had learned in Florence and Rome instead of doing mindless work. Anyone is much more likely to benefit and learn from something they love and enjoy. It is also more likely for the kid to retain the information better if they have some sort of association to it, like research about a place they went or sport they participated in. Teachers would have students returning back to school with project in their hands that they are excited to share with their peers. 
1639	It is time for teacher-designed projects, which can be less interesting, stressful for families, and rushed, to be replaced by student-designed projects where students are independantly creative. Although it is good for schools to make sure all their children are not losing skills over the break, the same skills would be practiced if children got more freedom to design their own activity. Plus, summer work would be full of more enjoyment and acedemic value! 
1640	While some teacher-designed projects are good, summer projects should be designed by the student 
1641	their summer plans will not get interrupted, 
1642	the student can choose a topic that interests them, 
1643	it allows the student to learn responsibility. 
1644	When people become overwhelmed with school they begin to stop doing work and paying attention because they feel as though their is no point in doing work, if they are just going to fail anyways. Having a summer vacation and making plans to hang out with friends and family can relieve some of the stress put on students, because they can take that break to re-energize their interest in learning. Summer plans can also consist of traveling to other countries, which could be beneficial in a students topic. If a teacher were to design the projects, then the student would not only miss out on a spectacular opportunity to travel, because of having to stay home to do the project, but also because of a fun interesting topic they had to miss out on. 
1645	The danger in this scenario is that when a student becomes uninterested in what they are learning, it causes the student to not pay attention and stop doing work because of the lack of strive to learn. Not only does this situation cause a strain on the student who did not do his or her work, and the teacher, but also the other students in the class. The other students are also effected, because the teacher is now required to take the time out of the new lessons to re-teach what should have already been learned. To prevent this lack of gusto, summer projects should be chosen by the students so they can pick a topic that makes them want to learn. 
1646	From being able to pick their topic, a student accepts the responsibility to create a project and execute it over the summer. This new found responsibility can encourage a student to create a planner to organize a schedule, make sure the project is relevant and challenging, and also that they can get the project done over their break, splitting their time doing fun activities and being able to recognize ones priorities. Students learning responsibilities like these at a young age can prepare them for their future careers. Since responsibility is such a big part in everyday life as an adult it is important that students learn how to be responsible now than in the future when it is too late. 
1647	Since some schools require summer projects they should be student- designed because students should have a summer to relax and not have their plans ruined, students can choose a topic they are interested in and it allows students to learn responsibility. While there are so many more examples of why summer projects should be student led the examples stated are the most important ones. Students being able to make their own decisions is apart of life, and the school system not granting that experience is a tragedy because is stunts a students growth in learning. 
1648	"According to the author of the ""Challenges of Exploring Venus,"" he believes that it is a good idea to pursue more knowledge of the planet Venus. The author feels that getting to know our sister planet is important, and that there are ways to explore this planet safely and effectivly "
1649	The author gives great examples of ways too explore the planet safely and effectivly, also he gives reasons why it would be beneficial.  
1650	"Venus having an average of 800 degrees fahrenheit on its surface, make's it virtually inhabitable to humans. These conditons are so extreme the author explains that ""such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed too diving to the deepest parts of our oceans."" Venus has very harsh conditions and it make's it virtually impossible to explore it from the surface and proposes a tough challenge on finding alternatives ways to explore it. Although, NASA has proposed an idea to explore the harsh planet. NASA believes we can explore the planet from a distance approximately 30 miles away. The author explains that the pressure would be comparable to sea level on earth, tempature would be around 170 degrees. The author states that ""Not easy conditions but survivable for humans."" The mission would propose great danger and it would be a expontential battle, but with the right people and technology it could be done and accomplished. The benefit is the knowledge gained from this great planet that has had the world beat for a long time, it is time to step up to the challenge and explore Venus for the people of this world. "
1651	In conclusion, the author supports the exploration of Venus, and is open to finding ways to explore this harsh planet. He believes that the knowledge we would gain from Venus would be very beneficial to the people. He believes that mankind has endured many other harsh endeavors such as the exploration of Venus, and the curosity of mankind will likely lead us to exploring the great hot planet of Venus. 
1652	Mandatory participation in extracurricular activities is not good for students 
1653	they may not have time to stay after (jobs, other classes, homework, sports) 
1654	they might not be interested in any of the activities offered at school, 
1655	they lose the freedom to choose for themselves. 
1656	They get homework from multiple classes, participate in sports or music classes, and they hangout with their friends and have fun being a teenager. Making students be forced to stay after school would not work for students who play sports and have practice, or students who have to help support their families with a job. Having them be forced to do an activity would take away time from other things that they need to do, or things that they want to do. 
1657	Some people like to play basketball, some like to play hockey, some like to play football. Likewise, students all have different sets of skills and things that they enjoy. Some students may want to do something that is not offered at that school, yet they wouldn't be able to. It doesn't make sense that they should participate in something that they don't enjoy. If a person who does not like to play sports is forced to play an after school sport, that would unfair towards them. Or, if a person who only likes to draw has to take an extracurricular activity, what would they do if there isn't an art club? Making the students do something they would not like or they're not interested in is not very fair. 
1658	Making participation mandatory for extracurricular activities is impeding on the students right to choose for themselves. They learn in their classes that everyone has their rights, and taking them away is very unconstitutional, so it's ironic that their ability to have a choice is taken away from them. They don't have the freedom to choose if they want to participate anymore, which is unfair. 
1659	Mandatory participation in extracurricular activities is bad for students because the students may not have time, they might not be interested and they lose the ability to choose for themselves. It is important students that students have the right to choose so they know that there are always options. If students are forced to take extracurricular activites, they will become more disheartened, more weary and tired from balancing their social and academic lives along with sports and other classes, and wake up with less promise that they would have a good day. After all, we do need to nurture our students, as they are the future of the world, as the next generation. 
1660	Even though summer projects are designed to help students and can be done in a number of ways, it is beneficial to have it designed based on the teacher's curriculum and needs. 
1661	Having it designed around the teacher's curriculum and upcoming plans allows for students to get a grasp and to expect what will be taught and the level of difficulty the class will be. 
1662	summer assignments for math tend to review previous subjects that will be used for a harder math course and will help expand on this knowledge. A summer assignment that I have done is one for Precalculus with Trigonometry that not only reviewed previous math skills but expanded on them which helped to prepare me for the course. Students have voiced that these projects are too hard and can never finish them in time. That is why assignments are given at the beginning of summer to allow exponential time to do them and are made in a way to teach and prepare students for what they will learn in a harder course, making an easier assignment will not be beneficial for these reasons. Summer projects can be made with different variations, having them based on a teacher's plans allows for an preparedness and an expansion of skills. 
1663	Summer projects are a beneficial tool for all students and teachers, though it is helpful for a teacher in the new year to teach the subject if students have some knowledge about it. Students tend to struggle when going into a new year, especially with classes that are college leveled and they have no knowledge about it or what they may be getting into. For an AP class, it can be useful for a student to complete an assignment and have some indication of what the teacher's curriculum is and be able to prepare for the class or even drop if they feel like they may fail it. I am in college weighted class now, and if it wasn't for the summer project, I can say I could have possible failed the class if it wasn't based on the teacher's curriculum and I could've been entirely loss in the class. Students may say that a summer assignment should be fun and they should be able to pick what to do, but a student picking the assignment will not be beneficial for the teacher, it can cause a teacher to redo their year plans and may be behind on teaching and preparing a student for an upcoming exam. 
1664	Though students can pick if what and if they want to do the summer project, the assignments being based on the teacher's future teaching plans will allow the student to know upcoming expectations. 
1665	Summer projects are a tool to help a teacher, having them designed around the teacher's plans will allow each teacher to know where each student is and know where to focus most in the curriculum. 
1666	Every student had different previous teachers who teach in different ways and have different capabilities and extensions of learning which can cause a struggle for teachers. For example, my English summer project was to read and annotate a novel so I could write an argumentative essay on it. After turning it in, it became clear to my AP Language Arts teacher that not every student was on the same skill level for writing and that she would have to reteach the basis of writing for different formats of essays; without the summer project she would not have know this. Summer reading assignments should allow a student to choose the book so they will want to read and get the assignment done. Having this choice, students may pick a book that is not on their skill level and can hurt them when doing assignments in the class. It will ruin teacher plans on what each unit will be and what will be taught in said units 
1667	Summer assignments come in a variety of ways, but having them based on the teacher's units and plans for the school year will prepare both student and teacher. Summer projects can be used in any subject to benefit the teacher and allow a smooth year for easier teaching when knowing the students skill set and be prepared to change plans to accommodate these. As a student continues to move up the grades and start taking college leveled classes, it is imperative to have some incoming knowledge of the subject and to expand on previous skills. Summer projects can either be student designed or teacher designed, but in the end a student ill benefit only if the assignment is based on the teacher. 
1668	there will be a higher chance of completion due to, a time frame, 
1669	taking away pressure 
1670	a quenching of students thirst for knowledge. 
1671	When it comes to any type of work there is a time frame in which it needs to be completed. 
1672	When teachers assign students projects they are thought out and planned, if students are given the opportunity to design projects themselves especially over break there is the factor of procrastination. Teachers will assign students a project that is set in stone which will take away thoughts of changing the project over and over again which would lead to time loss. Teacher designed projects may not impact students summer break at all because, the student will know exactly what he or she has to do in order to complete project . 
1673	Teacher designed projects also take pressure off the students 
1674	People old and young have a thirst for knowledge students especially. Teachers may give students a project they know nothing about but the goal is for the student to keep learning while on break 
1675	When given a teacher designed project if the students have all the knowledge about the project, or not they will learn or discover new things. Projects require research which gives students the opportunity to discover tons of new information. Widening the students education and preparing them for next year. Student may pick an easy project that requires only prior knowledge which will keep them at same level of education they had before summer break. Which is why teacher designed projects will give students an opportunity to better themselves. 
1676	Some may argue that student designed projects will benifit the student more than a teacher designed project because of the chance of an easy grade. 
1677	When a teacher designed project will give students the opprotunity to widen their knowledge 
1678	if anything would happen to Earth it would be the nearest option for a planetary visit, 
1679	we would learn more about Venus and the planet's harsh conditions, 
1680	Venus is like Earth in multiple ways like being able to support life.  
1681	If anything would ever happen to Earth, Venus would be our closet option for a planetary visit 
1682	Secondly, we should continue studying Venus because it will allow us to learn more about Venus and the planet's harsh conditions. 
1683	"In paragraph three the text illustrates,""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" This piece of text from paragraph three shows that we should continue studying Venus because it will allow us to learn more about the plant's harsh conditions and we would be able to see what materials could or couldn't work in such extreme heat. "
1684	Finally, Venus is the planet that is most like Earth and use to have to ability to support life. 
1685	In summary, we should continue studying the planet Venus despite the dangers because if anything were to happen to our planet, Earth, Venus would be the closest planet we could go to, we could learn more about Venus and the planet's harsh conditions, and because Venus is most like Earth and had the ability to support life. Furthering our research on Venus can only benefit us, so lets stop worrying about the dangers and get out and explore our planetary neighbor. 
1686	"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" did a fair job at arguing their claim, that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. "
1687	The author throughout the essay did not convey a very well stated thesis. Typically, a writer of an arguementative essay would feature their thesis openly, so that the reader is able to see what side the author is pushing forward. However, this author did not do this. 
1688	"The first paragraph introduces the topic of Venus with an interesting hook, but does not give the reader their side. The reader needs a thesis, without one the reader is not going to be able to have their opinion on a topic swayed. The author's current attempt at a thesis statement , ""While Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth, it has proved very challenging place to examine more closely,"" does not state what side they are on clearly. Their best declaration of the side they are on is in their very last paragraph. The author wrote, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" This is a very strongly worded thesis, but would have been much better if placed in the starting paragraph. Their side on the topic was acknowledged, but not as well as it could have been if they had set up their thesis correctly. "
1689	Beyond the thesis, the author used many counter-arguements in their writing. This is one of their strong suits, acknowledging both sides of an arguement is one of the best ways to convey your opinion affectively, while still being able to keep opposing side of the arguement interested and have their minds open to change 
1690	"The author is for the exploration of Venus, but consistently chooses to bring up the problems that doing so faces. The author writes about the difficulties about exploring Venus, because of the planet's extreme environment. They opposed their own side in paragraph three by saying, ""These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals."" This is an affective strategy, because people who may oppose exploration to Venus may say something similar to this. The author is arguing their own point to establish reliability and trust amongst with people who favor not exploring Venus. The author showing that they see the problems with exploring Venus shows that they are open minded and open to their mind being changed, and this will in turn have the reader do the same. "
1691	"From the example stated earlier, regaurding the extreme conditions in Venus, the author was able to provide a logical solution to the weather without using any opinions. The author wrote,""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow sceintists to float above the fray."" The author then goes onto describe NASA's plan in full depth, and going into fine detail about the floating contraption that would suspend the astronauts safely above the harsh atmosphere of Venus. They then state, ""Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" The author is displaying a solution for the conditions, and even the minor flaws it has. The author going into detail about the solution for the extreme conditions in Venus and even conceding a bit when saying, ""Not easy conditions but survivable for humans,"" helps argue their point. They affectively refuted the counter-arguements by using factual evidence in their rebutal, and deemed themselves trustworthy by the opposing side by even conceding slightly on a few issues. "
1692	"The author of ""The Callenge of Exploring Venus"" did a fair job when arguing that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. While the author did accurately present the dangers and solutions for the dangerous parts of exploring Venus, they failed to create a strong thesis. The author exceeded when giving factual information about the topic to help the reading get on their side of the arguement; do to them struggling to get across their position on if Venus exploration is worthwhile, some of the provided information they gave was not used to it's full potential when changing the reader's opinion. "
1693	In conclusion, cars are a hiderance. Cars are stressful and cumbersome objects, getting rid of them would help reduce stress in the population. Cars are high contributers to pollution, creating smog and causing problems. Also, cars are a comodity that is being used less and less. People are putting down the car keys and picking up a bike. So why not join the trend? 
1694	Although many people support using cell phones while driving, there are evidences and studies showing that the use of a cell phone while conducting a vehicle is dangerous and people should avoid using them while driving. 
1695	When driving, sometimes it is difficult to focus on the road, which makes it easy to forget that everyone else shares the roads as well 
1696	Many cannot focus fully on the road and the other vehicles, if one keeps talking on phone consistently while driving. This is what leads to fatal accidents. People may think they can multitask while conducting a vehicle and using their cellular devices but in reality that is not the case. Studies show that no matter how concentrated you may think you are, you cause an accident. Whether it's you hitting something small, making others get into an accident, or yourself hitting another car. 
1697	They both serve the same purpose when it comes to distracting the driver from the road. Although hands-free devices do not increase safety, but causes the same amount of distraction as if one were holding a phone. They both serve the same purpose when it comes to distracting the driver from paying attention to the road. Studies show that the reaction time significantly reduces when paying attention to a phone rather than the road for an aged person. Now imagine how much more this affects an elderly person.  
1698	Many drivers keep their cell phones in their vehicles. However, when it rings, they are not going to ignore it because of how tempted they will be to reach for it. Therefore, they lose all concentration while driving, and all the focus is on the phone 
1699	Not only should cellular devices be prohibited completely but, the law as well should be changed to not having a device at all while conducting a vehicle. This will prevent many accidents as well as saving many lives. Many people already do not follow the law and maybe never will. Only way they will actually respect the law is if an accidents happens to them or they get caught not obeying the law. Therefore, people should be restricted from using cellular devices while conducting a vehicle. No one wants to go through a terrible accident nor be the reason for a fatality.   
1700	School can already be long and tiring, so there's no need to make it longer for students. 
1701	Some students may be very good in a certain thing, such as writing stories, or sculpting, or some other talent that isn't very popular. This then leads to them having nowhere to go, leaving them with something they don't enjoy. If the school doesn't have a club or activity that suits them, then they shouldn't have to participate in one. If they do, it's just extra work that'll bore them. Clubs are supposed to be enjoyable, and help students find others that have the same interests as them, but if participating in a club or activity is mandatory, students may feel left out, and not included. They may be excluded and picked on for having a talent that others can't relate to,or be picked on for not being good at something. 
1702	In the morning, most students have a routine they follow. If they have an activity that begins 45 minutes before school, they have to rearrange their whole schedule. This can lead to them losing sleep, not getting a good enough breakfast, and generally under prepared for school. If a student has an after school activity, this can change and shorten their routine. If they get home, do homework, play games for 2 hours, eat dinner, shower, and then go to sleep, an activity can limit these things to less games or enjoyable activities, not as much of a dinner, and the day being taken up by mostly homework. It can cancel their time to relax or have fun, and cause a routine change. It shouldn't be up to the school to choose a students after or before school life, and throw off their entire schedule. 
1703	I disagree with the principal's idea. It lengthens out a long school day, can make students feel left out, and can mess with a student's schedule. It doesn't seem fair for the school to control a student's out of school time. While school is important, it shouldn't be a student's entire life, they need breaks from it. Clubs, activities, and sports are balanced because people who want to be in them join them, not because they have to. Other people can suffer from a student not participating in their activity making it not enjoyable for others. The school shouldn't choose a student's out of school life. 
1704	Should these summer projects be teacher designed or student designed? I feel they should be more favored to being student designed. Why would I think that? Why can't teachers determine the design of summer projects? Im going to tell my opinon why. 
1705	they know what type of schedule they have. 
1706	During most summers, students are going with families, going out of state, even sometimes they are going out of the country. If they have their own designed summer projects then they will know when to try and complete the projects on their own time. Plus, students take the summer time to have fun, and if teachers were designing these projects, it would be unfair to cut into the summer of students. 
1707	Maybe most teachers feel that if students really cared about learning and school, that it doesn't matter when the project is assigned to you, you should just do it. Also, teachers may think with all the time during the summer, students should have plenty of time to balance managing their summer fun with their summer projects. In some teachers head, I think they may be saying if you care enough to learn and keep your brain and mind focused during the break, doing the projects when they assign they should be no issue at all 
1708	What's the problem with students designing their summer project? It's not hurting anybody, it's at their own type of pace, they are not being rushed into something they may not be ready for, and I could go on and on about it. In the students' mind, they probably think if they design their own time to do the summer projects, when they are done with the assignments, the work will more than likely be more proifficent and way more precise, rather than teachers trying to assign them the assginments at the wrong time for some students. I would that the teachers would take that to head and be more aware of what students have going on. 
1709	"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author describes why putting a man on the moon seems like a walk in the park compared to the horrendous obstacles preventing humans from pushing the frontier with visiting one of Earth's neighbors, Venus. The thick atmosphere is toxic to us. The clouds of sulfuric acid, the incredibly high temperatures on the planet's surface, and pressure would present challenges to mankind and its technology. "
1710	"Yet, the author sees that mankind cannot be afraid of the risks when the rewards are so great. In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents "
1711	and the innovation in machines by researchers that could make them work long enough to expand mankind's knowledge on Venus. 
1712	The idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers is supported through Venus' vast similarites to Earth, which is why humans have such interest in this particular planet. 
1713	"The author explains points in Venus' history that have intrigued astronomers, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largelyt with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, "" (4). Besides having been closer to Earth's ""twin"" many years ago, Venus may be more similar than humans thought, shown through ""The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters,"" (4). Studying Venus could lead to us knowing why this planet is such a far cry from Earth now, and this could provide valuable with how humans interact with their environment. If Venus has such similar features to Earth, like valleys, then there is probably more to discover on Venus' surface. This peculiar connection between this planet and Venus shows how valuable exploration could prove, just as Venus' proximity further supports how worthy of a pursuit Venus is. "
1714	The idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the presented dangers is supported through Venus' proximity. The author conveys the usefulness of having Venus so close, 
1715	"""Because Venus is sometimes right around the corner-in space terms-humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world,"" (2). Time and distance can be very influential in making groundbreaking decisions, like pursuing the exploration of Venus, as can be seen through, ""...Venus can be sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel,"" (4). Humans love to have everything near by, like schools, work, and more, because of the convenience; the same benefit is seen with Venus. When the planet is close, the fuel needed would not be the same if humans were trying to get to Jupiter. There would be less of a chance of losing them. Time is essential in space, given humans' limited control out there, so proximity makes it that much easier for us to make the bold move. Venus's proximity gives reason to continue working towards exploring Venus, just as the innovations in machines have. "
1716	The idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it brings is supported through the innovation in machines that could make the close-up exploration of Venus possible. 
1717	"NASA's advancements for Venus exploration are promising, ""For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such chaos,"" (7). Humans would not be able to use the most advanced technology, but durability is the goal, ""By comparison, systems (mechanical computers that use gears and levers to calculate) that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces,"" (7). If humans were to only hover over Venus, the possibilites are limited. Humans and technology have to be as close as possible. Technology that could last for a few weeks is enough to vastly expand our knowledge. Mechanical computers are now obsolete, but in Venus would be a valuable tool, just like the other electonics being made. Researchers have worked tirelessly to continue making Venus exploration a reasonable reality. "
1718	"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents is supported through Venus' vast similarities to Earth, Venus' proximity to Earth, and the innovation in machines by researchers that could make them work long enough to expand mankind's knowledge on Venus. The idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers is supported through Venus' vast similarites to Earth, which is why humans have such interest in this particular planet. The idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the presented dangers is conveyed through Venus' proximity. The idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite its hostile environment is supported through the innovation in machines that could make the close-up exploration of Venus possible. The author believes that sometimes humans cannot let curiosity, imagination, and innovation be trampled by the dangers and doubts. Humans cannot live in fear all the time. The human spirit always demands that humans continue striving towards knowing more.   "
1719	Today, the effect of summer break on students is debated as frequently as politics. Many are convinced that this long break causes students to forget material that they have just learned. Schools have tried to combat this issue in various ways; one way is to require summer projects. This would assure that students continue learning during their break. However, this solution begs the question of if these projects should be designed by the teachers or the students. 
1720	The time needed to plan and form a project would be solely on the teacher, not each individual student. This entire process can be very stressful and overwhelming, especially for a student who does not have a degree in the subject. The stress and frustration would continue, especially if a student cannot get approval. A student-designed project would require the student to present their project idea to the teacher for approval. Whereas a teacher-designed project would already be approved, eliminating the hassle of the first few steps in the project making process. For example, a high school student, Generic_Name, is going into an advanced science class. She has the idea to do a project where she will conduct a survey asking different people to pick their preferred flower from a list. The teacher denies her request because it does not reflect the class level. Generic_Name then has to go back and start from square one, frustrated and angry. A student may have to go back again and again, especially frustrated because it is wasting valuable time in the middle of their summer. 
1721	Students would be unaware of the topics related to the course they are going into, for they have not studied it yet. It would be impossible for them to form a beneficial project related to the subject. A teacher could use this project as a precursor to the unit they will study first, beginning to teach right when they get back to school. The students will have some background on the topic, ready to jump in. The students will then be able to have class discussions on the topic, because they all did the same project and are on the same page. For example, Generic_Name is a rising senior in high school going into an American literature class. He is told that he must complete a project over summer. He decides to read a biography on George Washington and do a report on the book. He has no idea that the first unit in the class is poetry. It would have been more beneficial to Generic_Name and the other students in that class if the teacher was able to assign the project. The teacher could have given the students many Edgar Allen Poe poems and assigned a thrilling project to go along with the mysterious and captivating works of Poe. Coming back from summer break, the class could discuss what they read and share their projects with each other. Having a teacher design a relevant project would unify the class and be a wonderful bridge to aid in the transition from summer into a new school year. 
1722	With the teacher designing the project, they could make a clear and distinct rubric. This would inform students exactly what the teacher is looking for. It is very difficult to complete a project when you are not sure how it will be graded. Teachers would be able to help students and answer any questions they may have. For example, over the summer, Generic_Name has an assignment to research her favorite U.S. president and write a paper on their life. The teacher provides an over view of the assignment, a list of all the requirements, and a rubric. Generic_Name would like to add a page on the president's children. However, she is not sure if that is allowed, considering that the assignment was only on the president himself. She sends an email to her teacher and asks her question. The teacher is able to answer her question almost immediately, because the teacher knows exactly what they want. The teachers should formulate the projects, so they can assist the students and guide them. 
1723	Some may argue that student-designed projects allow students to have creativity, individuality, and freedom. As a result of these things, students would be more inclined to complete the project; 
1724	however, these self-assigned projects could easily be swept under the rug, especially in the midst of an exciting summer break. More time, thought, and preparation must go into a student designed project, discouraging students from setting aside appropriate time to devote to the project, because they view it as too challenging. 
1725	, summer projects should be designed by teachers. This would be more beneficial to both students and teachers. The teachers would be able to assign projects that are relevant to their lesson, relating their summer work to the unit they will be studying first, allowing them to be able to start learning as soon as they get back to school. During the months of summer break, the last thing that students want is the stress of a project. It would be much easier and less stressful if the teachers designed the project to reduce the amount of preparation needed from the students. The teachers would give the students clear guidelines, and then be able to help the students because they have a distinct idea of what they are looking for. Summer projects should be teacher-designed to insure the relevancy of the project, guarantee structured guidelines, and limit the unnecessary stress for students.  
1726	"Whether it's playing sports, participating in student council, school plays, or just painting in art club, all teens and students need that extra confidence, and adrenaline boost that extracurricular activities provide. Principle of Generic_School, Generic_Name, is proposing a new, controversial school rule that states, ""All students at BRMS  must participate in at least one extracurricular activity throughout the year."" Should his rule be enforced or shot down? "
1727	but forcing kids to branch out and do extracurricular activities will bring them out of their shell and mold them into a better person. 
1728	By forcing students to participate in activities that they may not have signed up for on their own, they are forced out of their shell and meet new people who share similar passions. 
1729	In a pole taken at Southern Utah Middle School, the students were asked approximately how many friends they had and generally how they met. The study discovered that most students who were involved in clubs, student council, sports, and etc. answered with higher numbers of friends, many of which they made through their out of school activities. This shows that you don't only just learn a trade catered to your interests, but you also meet lots of new people who share those interests and become your closest relative friends. You could even meet your soul mate! At Harvard University, the students studied married couples and found that over 70% of their top ten passions and interests were shared, that's 7 out of 10! Forming bonds with new people can help with trust and relationship issues and can all be done through simply being forced to branch out and participate in an extracurricular activity at your school. 
1730	"World renown author of several New York Times awarded self-help books, doctor, and psychiatrist, Leonard Steigerwald explains, ""Getting involved in clubs, sports, and other extracurricular activities can not only boost your physical health, but mental too."" Steigerwald is stating the obvious, when students participate in sports, or even a poem writing club, they are staying physically, and mentally active. Being around other people can also help keep you mentally healthy. A recent news story even further investigates this topic, New York resident, Flynn Engstrom, was visiting a relative in Colorado when he got lost on a hike. He was missing for a month and six days and when the police found him, he was in a desperate state. He was so happy to see people that he began to cry uncontrollably. He remembered, ""I was longing to see humans again. I barely had food, or clean water and in my weak mental state, I began to imagine things,"" he shuddered, ""Horrible things that I had convinced myself were real. Seeing those officers, [I] felt my sanity pouring back into my mind."" Although this story is quite an extreme example. If students are just sitting at home all day after school on their phones, their confidence and motivation to do anything will begin to dwindle. "
1731	Having a clear head space has been proven to help with academics, and participating in extracurricular activities has proven to help clear your mind. 
1732	"In 2017 students who are active in their community and school were proven to have better SOL, SAT, and just overall grades. GPAs in Colleges have been harder to meet as far as the 110% of all the valedictorians from high schools around the globe. Getting involved in out of or in school activities can look good on job applications, college applications, and can just generally give you motive when you are having a hard time in life. Professor at the University of Utah in Northern Canada, Jillian Hooper explains, ""Everyday I see students struggle with their grades, and everyday the only ones who can bounce back are those who take a break, and spend time volunteering, practicing a sport, or any other extracurricular activity, it's vital for these college students."" She wants people to understand that activities can be beneficial. "
1733	" Although it's pretty clear that Generic_Name's rule should be passed, it was mentioned earlier to be controversial. This is because several parents and students at Generic_School say that this rule is infringing on their right to pursue happiness. The Constitution clearly states, when listing the rights of all U.S. citizens, ""The pursuit of happiness"" "
1734	"however there are certain exceptions to this law. In schools, students are required to take SOLs and other tests. Do SOLs make students happy? No. Unfortunately though, it is required in schools. Requiring extracurricular activities is quite on the contrary. Instead of going home and ""pursuing happiness"" on their phones, the teens would be able to occasionally stay after school with friends and do something that they care about. The Physical Education Council in Western Loudoun County in Virginia conducted a study with some interesting results. The tracked the brains levels of happiness through the process of cells creating a natural sort of nicotine. When this chemical is released in the brain, it causes the feeling that humans identify as, ""being happy"". The study proved that the chemical was released more often in those who were social and around other people rather then loners, who study, work, and text by themselves. "
1735	This means that when students participate in activities with others, they are actually happier and mentally healthier. 
1736	it will cause less pollution 
1737	less accidents. 
1738	Limiting the usage of cars with help keep our enviromnet/society accident free and see those familar faces which we saw as we grew up. 
1739	"In "" The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because Venus is interesting, helpful, and it is safe "
1740	"For example,"" a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. huang predicts. "" Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instrucuture."" This is really helpful to some students because when taking an online lesson some of them might be comfused and the teacher is no there to help. So the computer can take these facial expresions and modify the lesson so you could undestand it better. This also follows along if a student needs help with the lesson, the computer could see you are having a hard time and t to help you by changing the lesson "
1741	"Many believe that automobiles, especially the very popular ""car"", can be very bad for the enviroment. According to the article, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", it explains how near-record pollution within Paris caused a partial driving ban. This was to help clean the smog infested air in the dense city. Although many delivery companies complained about lost revenue, congestion within the capitcal lowered by 60 percent. By Monday that week, ""the smog cleared enough for the ruling French party to rescind the ban for odd-numbered plates on tuesday"". In another article called ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"", this one tells how Bogota, Columbia has also banned cars to promote alternate transportation and reduce smog. The ban is only for one day a year (called The Day Without Cars), but it's helped cause the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, new, smoot sidewalks, less traffic, and new restaurants and shopping areas. Business man, Carlos Plaza claims ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" "
1742	Cars, both the rose and the thorns in a community and enviroment, can be both benificial and harmful to people, depending on who you are. For most regular pedeastrians and citizens within a city, less cars means less pollution, traffic, and stress. Unless you are a business owner of a car dealership or working for a delivery company, limited car usage means very postive things for social relationships, health, the enviroment, and general living conditions of a busy city. The less harmful emissions of gases from cars could greatly affect the outcome of our clean, energy efficient future.            
1743	Today, many humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis. The introduction of the modern-day cell phone has made life easier. The cell phone has improved communication between individuals despite the distance. Cell phones have also made receiving information easier for the user when lacking understanding on a certain subject. In other words, the invention has made life more convenient, which resulted in dependence on the object. However, there must be a limitation to the usage of the object, especially when using the cell phone at that time can be life threatening. One of the many times that a cell phone should not be operated is while driving. 
1744	Drivers should not be allowed to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle because the action is extremely dangerous for every person on the road. 
1745	According to the studies conducted by the National Safety Council, it was shown that using a cell phone while driving has led to 1.6 million crashes each year with 390,000 of them resulting in injuries. 
1746	The reasoning behind this is when the driver takes their attention away from the road, the dangerousness of the situation increases by 400%. During the time the driver looks down at their phone to check a message, read the GPS, or receive a phone call, an accident can occur. Therefore, to prevent any accidents, all distractions must be eliminated, such as cellular devices. Moreover, by eliminating all distractions, the safety of everyone on the road is increased  
1747	This, however, is not true. Even though the driver is using the device for navigation, the probability of an accident occurring when distracted is still 400%. The GPS defense will also be used as a justification for operating a phone while operating a vehicle. Through the form of loopholes, drivers will use the GPS excuse against police officers to avoid the ticket.  
1748	The different sides of texting and driving, whether to allow it or not, is an irrational debate. The debate between the sides is a debate between what is right and safe versus what is fun yet dangerous. Many laws and economic consequences have been set into place to avoid the death and destruction of using a cell phone while operating a vehicle that can take place. 
1749	While ignorance is bliss and most drivers highly doubt the possibility of an accident because of using a phone while driving, there is still a 400% chance of crashes occurring due to being distracted. Laws being passed to establish security among citizens are in vain due to the ignorance of people that do not care about the risks. They do not only put themselves in danger, but the driver is also responsible for the passengers, pedestrians, and the other people on the road. 
1750	"As they say ""There is a time and place for everything"" (Gloria Tesch), and driving is not the time and place "
1751	According to sources, in 2011 out of 1.3 million car crashes, at least 23% of those crashes involve cell phones. 
1752	A lot of these drivers reported that they were texting and driving during the time of the accident. The rest reported to have been talking on the phone. Majority of the vehicles that were involved were light trucks and motorcycles. More than 3/4 of drivers said they would likely answer calls while driving and rarely consider traffic situations when deciding to use a cell phone. Most drivers said they would answer a call or text while driving but would feel unsafe as a passenger if the driver was texting.  
1753	Growing up going to school, I always looked forward to summer break. It was my time to be free and to be a kid again. Going to the beach, family cookouts, and hanging out with friends are things I always looked forward to doing. Each summer would be better then the last. Until my mom got that call from my school, reminding her about our summer break project. She would bother me nonstop, asking me thousands of questions about it daily. Looking back to my past summers I never once did a student-designed project. 
1754	students would do subjects that they are interested in resulting in more projects being completed 
1755	students would be able to pick a subject that they know they are good at rather then them doing something they have no experience with. 
1756	Throughout my years in school I never once did a summer project that I was truly interested in. Most projects made us read a certain book and summarize it in some unique way. Every summer, one after another, we did the same type of project. Over and over again, reading a book and summarizing it. Those projects started to get boring and some summers I didn't even do them. Students never got a choice with anything. We didn't get to choose what project we did, we didn't get to choose if we worked with a group, we didn't even get to choose what book we did our report on. 
1757	In the past I have come across many assignments including projects, homework, and classwork that I have gotten terrible grades on because I had no idea what to do or what they were even talking about. When the teachers are designing the summer projects they are following the guidelines of their boss or school district. They don't think about how well the students know it. They don't think about the future and what the students grades are going to be. They think about one thing and one thing only, designing the project and designing it right. If students were able to design their summer project the grades would be so much better. 
1758	"Teachers could say, ""These projects are simple, your just reading a book and answering easy questions."" What if some students can't actually read? What if some students just aren't good with English in general? "
1759	Summer break is a time for laughter and fun. Summer break is a break from school. Students shouldn't have to stress the fact that they have a project due on the first day of school. Specially a project that is challenging and overall boring. Teachers have no intent on making the projects interesting or easy for the students. They honestly just want to get it done so they can go on their break as well. Allowing students to design the summer break projects would be a step in the right direction.  
1760	People go to school not only because they have to, but because a school's job is to advance students knowledge to set up kids and teens for their future goals. A teacher's job in the workplace is to give students knowledge on things they must know and help them with their next step in life. Their next step could be; college, applying for a job, help writing a resume, applying for a college, looking for a major, etc. After a long 9 months of school, some schools require students to complete a summer project to assure learning over the break. 
1761	it introduces themselves, 
1762	helps students discover their interest, 
1763	develops creativity. 
1764	Summer projects should be student-designed to introduce themselves to their teachers the following school year 
1765	Students developing a project on their own develops creativity 
1766	Students are in school receiving teacher-designed projects all year. On a students summer break, they should at least be able to create a project that interest them. Many young kids, between 3-7, try many different sports like; soccer, basketball, dance, gymnastics, baseball, cheer leading, flag football, etc. parents enroll their kids in different things so they can discover their interest young and stick to what does interest them to improve. Many high schools have electives to chose from as an extra class for students to find their interest. If teachers picked the elective classes for the students there is a good chance the student would not enjoy the class, destroying the point of an elective. By letting students branch out and selecting things that they enjoy could create an amazing project. 
1767	Students wait all year for their three month summer break. Most schools dont require a summer project, however, some schools do. Over break there should be no project but if required give students the opportunity to design their own. This could not only benefit the students, but the teachers as well. A student-designed project would introduce students to their teachers, giving the teachers an idea of what the student does and does not know. It would cause students to brainstorm and come up with creative projects and help student's to find what interest them. A student-designed summer project would be effective for students as well as teachers.                                        
1768	You need to watch out for the terrible situations in the terrible situations then you will get hurt 
1769	There is no form of life on Mars, otherwise, NASA would have detected in years ago. 
1770	The Face is nothing but a landmass, the scientific name: A mesa. 
1771	I believe the image of the Viking is just a landform and it wasn't created by aliens. I will explain to you why i think it's a landform. 
1772	I believe the image is a just a landform because scientists haven't discovered life yet on mars even though they have found water on Mars. 
1773	Do you wanna take care of horses,young cows,and mules? Well if you do,Join the Seagoing Cowboys in taking our adventure ot help people anad places bombed in World War ll.  
1774	Extracurricular activities should be mandatory because kids could look forward to activities after school instead of going home and sitting around for hours.  
1775	It would help kids stay out of trouble, 
1776	keep students active, 
1777	help students build a social life. 
1778	Most students parents have and office job. The average work time is from 9am to 5pm, and school gets out at around 2pm- 4pm, so most kids are left unsupervised for around 2-6 hours. Kids left alone can get into all sorts of trouble and can be persuaded to do things that they know they should not do. Kids can be convinced to do drugs, join gangs, and vandalize public property. Instead of doing these things they can be supervised at school doing something that is fun and enjoyable instead of being mischievous. The school environment would be much safer because students wouldnt be influenced be other people to do any bad things, so they would not be doing or selling drugs and they would not be in or associated with a gang. Therefore, students would not bring in bad things into our schools. 
1779	Some kids go home and play sports outside or play a game with their siblings, but most kids go home and play video games for 5 hours till they have to eat dinner or go to bed. This is very unhealthy. An extracurricular activity would get a person who usually plays lots of video games to do something active. They could play sports after school and they would still have time for video games. Playing sports after school could convince them to play sports for fun, not because they have to do something after school and they could join a league and exercise more than just after school. This would help kids stay active and healthy. After school activities for all people is a good idea because it would help kids stay active and healthy. 
1780	During the school day some kids do not socialize with others because they are tired, shy, or they are very focused on academics. After school, activities would really help kids gain a social life. After school activities are laid back and are made too do something active after school, not to secretly trick kids into too staying an extra hour after school. The activities after school are fun, they are meant to be. Kids after school who are shy can communicate with others because the activities give them ways to start of conversations and communicate with others. 
1781	Extracurricular activities should be mandatory. This would help kids stay out of trouble because it would keep them doing something healthy instead of something mischievous. It would students kids stay healthy because it would force them to do something active. and finally, it would help students because it would help students gain a social life because they could communicate with others.                                                 
1782	reducing greenhouse gases emitted making for a better environment, 
1783	less usage of cars can lower stress and is safer.  
1784	"By limiting the amount that the citizens of the United States operate their vehicles, the condition of our environment's atmosphere will improve.  As stated in Source 1, ""and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States.""  This passage is referring to the amount of greenhouse gas emitted here in America because of passenger cars.  By not using car and taking advantage of other methods of transportation such as buses, walking, and riding a bike that number can be reduced significantly.  In the United States we are also learning from mistakes made by other countries and cities.  ""After days of near-record pollution,"" Source 2 says, ""Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.""  A lesson can be taken from Paris of how we do not want to end up in a situation like that.  By limiting our driving currently we can avoid having to take major steps to clean and clear our environment.  ""It will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants,"" a sociologist predicts in Source 4. "
1785	"A decent amount of stress comes with owning and operating a motorized vehicle.  You are constantly worrying about if you will be late, or if you have enough gas to make it from point A to point B.  Children are another concern and trying to keep them safe around roads and driving by themselves.  Limiting the use of cars can create a less stressful, and safer society.  In Source 3 it explains that, ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up.""  Lowering the use of cars can make life a little less busy because it is one thing less that you have to worry about throughout your day.  Heidrun Walter said, in Source 1, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way.""  "
1786	Although the use of cars may be convienent, the benifits of limiting the usage may be beginning to outweight the inconviences. Between reducing the greenhouse gas creating a cleaner environment as well as lessening stress and making the roads safer, the advantages of limiting car usage in the United States are major.    
1787	Summer is the time of the year every student looks forward to. Apart from socializing with friends, enjoying the fresh air, and participating in outdoor activities, students have the chance to assure their learning abilities through summer projects. 
1788	Summer projects should be school-designed because it allows flexibility, 
1789	it develops leadership skills 
1790	it increases creativity. 
1791	Student-designed projects allows flexibility during summer break. 
1792	Developing leadership skills for the future are offered through student-designed projects. 
1793	Designing their own promotional plans, students from the Technology Student Association were able to pursue college business majors. The Technology Student Association allowed students to be completely in charge of their own work to get a sense of the leadership that is needed in many technology and business fields today. As a result, the ones who were consistent in their work and created their own designs were the most successful at the TSA regional competitions. Student-designed projects allows students to be in control and have the opportunity to manage work responsibly. Even though having a teacher-designed project can help in follow instructions and meeting deadlines, being ones own boss opens doors to many leadership opportunities to excel in the work field, and in ones personal life.  Panera Bread employees that have shown leadership development have moved to higher job positions. In the food industry, like most jobs, employees must start off with a lower position and must enhance their abilities in order to move up to a higher position. For example, in Panera Bread, most new employees start of working as a cashier, dining room attendant, or produce worker; these minor positions prepare the employee with basic skills and prepare them for future duties. Later, when more experience is gained, employees move up to trainer or manager assistant. Similarly, student-designed projects help students learn to be self-sufficient and lead one another to success. As a result, future generations are encouraged to do the same. 
1794	Student-designed projects allow students to show their full potential through creativity. 
1795	it gives students the opportunity to develop research skills, 
1796	choose topics that they find interesting, 
1797	result in an increase in positive mental health. 
1798	Suppose a teacher assigns a project with specific guidelines and one topic to develop a solution to. This may make the expectations for the student clear-cut, but this type of project learning limits students in what they can explore. With the ability to design your own project, students learn how to research various topics before deciding on the one they will come up with a project to. Not only does this contribute to the development of enhanced research skills among students, but it prepares them for research in the future. In pursuing higher levels of education, it is crucial that students are knowledgeable on how to research about topics efficiently and accurately. Thus, those research skills are developed from student-designed projects and they benefit current and future educational advancement. 
1799	when I was in 6th grade I had a summer project of choosing an influential president and explaining what that president did for the country. At the time, I was interested in science instead of history. As a result, this project seemed lackluster and an arduous task to complete over my summer break. However, if I had been given the opportunity to choose a topic that interests me, I would have found the summer project exponentially more exciting and something to look forward to. Many students feel the same way about this, as they wish to choose the topic they will research and create a solution to. Therefore, it is evident that summer projects should be student-designed so that students can have a genuine interest in the project they are completing. 
1800	Time and time again summer projects are dreaded by students and a task that many do not look forward to. As a result, students are left unhappy during summer break in regards to completing a project their teacher designed. This is either because the project has limitations, is about an uninteresting topic, or is difficult to complete. These factors can leave students feeling demoralized from completing their summer project and can make summer break a dreary time. Despite these conditions that come with teacher-designed projects, these problems can be solved with student-designed projects. When given the chance to explore what interests you and choosing whether any limitations exist regarding your project, inevitably students are inclined to complete summer projects. From the perspective of a student, you have more motivation to work on a self-designed project. This increased motivation correlates to an increase in mental health. When regarding this benefit, summer projects should be student-designed. 
1801	Summer is the time to relax and unwind from the stresses of the school year. It's a time of mornings spent sleeping in, afternoons laying out by the pool, and nights sleeping on the roof, counting the stars that gleam in the sky. That is why students look forward to summer break. As a result, schools should not contribute in reversing the association students make between summer break and enjoyment by assigning teacher-designed projects. With the intention of continual learning occurring over summer break, schools should allow projects to be student-designed. It gives students the chance to explore their passions and make new discoveries without any limitations. Teacher-designed projects only serve in holding students back from doing projects that truly hold meaning to them. Taking into consideration all of these factors, the most logical decision schools can make is having summer projects that are student-designed. This will allow students to have a good time in both the academic and non-academic part of their summer break.  
1802	While the idea of using a Facial Action Coding System in the educational process would certainly be interesting, I do not think it is nearly advanced enough to be able to be used in modern schools. 
1803	Even if we allowed camera's to scan the faces of students in school, we would not be able to decode their emotions in a speed befiting our educational system today. 
1804	"At the seventh passage, the author states that, ""Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile,"" suggesting that the majority of modern computers do not have the power to actually run the software. The PCs that schools buy are almost never more powerful than the ones bought by consumers for household use, and would thus also not be able to process the data, making the technology rather useless in an educational setting. "
1805	Even if a school had the funds to buy a computer that could process the data quickly enough to be useful, 
1806	If we were to simply put that first fact aside and instead look at the ability for this technology to assist students in an ideal setting, we still find that students can fake their emotions in order to cheat the system. 
1807	"In the third passage of the artice, the author states, ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness ... and then associated each with charactersitic movements of the facial muscles,"" meaning that the software associated voluntary or involuntary movements of the face with emotions. The problem with this system is that students can change the look of their face quite easily, and can thus convince the computer to produce desired results, making the system disfunctional. There are quite a few reasons children, especially young ones, would want to make the software not work, including tricking the computer into moving from the original learning program into a more desired one and them simply wanting to see the program fail through their abilities. "
1808	The idea of being able to find out the emotions of all of the chidlren in a school on a whim also rises privacy concerns that would need to be addressed before any program including this software would be implemented. 
1809	"The information gathered from students could be used for selfish purposes, as explained in the sixth passage of the article, ""if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different,"" showing that companies have use for this technology to better their businesses. If ad companies managed to get this emotional information from students all across the country, either from the government itself or through illegal actions, they could use that information to make new products and ads that would try to exploit the emotions of children. Because of this and the added concern of giving the information to the government itself, many parents would oppose a system that tracks and records the emotions of children. "
1810	Because of the lack of availablity, the potential cheating of the software, and the privacy concerns involved, the Facial Action Coding System is not able to be used in its current state to benefit schools. While this technology could be used in the future to help students, for example students with mental disabilities, it is not able to do so as it is now. It will be interesting to see what this and similar technologies grow to be, for better or for worse. 
1811	Venus is a worthy planet because it does not have all of man kind on it destroying it or usig it. Venus is a place where some people go to see outisde of our world to see what space really does look like. 
1812	Students should chose when and to who they reveal their emotions, and this system deprives them of that freedom. 
1813	"As stated in by Nick D'Alto, most human communication is not verbal. Meaning that people express their emotions by their looks or their actions, but they chose when to do this. The Facial Action Coding System takes away this freedom from students, they do not have the choice when to express what they are feeling if anyone can just use a face scanning system on them. "" Imagine being able to detect exaclty how other people are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotions (D'Alto 1),"" this first sentence perfectly shows how it takes away peoples freedom of when they want to express certian emotions tocertian people. "
1814	Every human has naturaul rights, and in America everyone has the right to freedom of speech. But part of that right to speech is having the choice not to speak. The Facial action Coding System would take away people's freedom of facial expression or emotion. People should have the right to chose to who and when they express their emotions, and this system takes away these rights. 
1815	As a student, one of the worst situations is one where an assignment is given that is unclear, vague, or otherwise difficult to understand. Completing projects is usually a laborsome enough activity on its own, but when the question or prompt is incomprehensible, it turns a small hill of a task into a mountain of one. Too many students have been in this situation and know what it is like to be immeasurably confused and frustrated because the assignment is too difficult to interpret. To make matters worse, students quite often do not know how to contact their teachers during the summer, so they are given no help or clarity as to what they are supposed to do. 
1816	To avoid this, as well as a multitude of other issues, summer projects should be designed by the students, 
1817	they understand how to design the project to make it more ideal 
1818	it will allow the students to have more control over which direction the project is taken, 
1819	it would also benefit the teachers by stopping them from having to do even more work. 
1820	By designing their own projects, students could eliminate this obstacle and just create something based on what they took away from their learning 
1821	One could argue that this is counter intuitive since students would not all have the takeaway the teacher wants them to gain, 
1822	but summer projects are once again just about assuring that students are learning and usually not followed up on as true assignments. The question of if a student learned the same thing as everyone else should not be as important as them just learning something relevant in general. 
1823	Giving students control over what they do for a summer project could greatly benefit their learning. By requiring them to design the project themselves, students are then also required to step up to the plate and be more responsible and creative. Learning to develop these characteristics is far more important than any history or science lesson their project may be on. As stated earlier, summer projects are usually not followed up on, making students even more likely to forget what they learned about from them. And at the very least, making the projects student-designed would save teachers from having to do it themselves, which they would most likely appreciate since they are already given enough work as is.  
1824	And my explanation for that is because if they want to have a more clearer picture then they should take another one up there. And again they might even get an even bettere and bigger because of the technology we have today. It might be even in high definition so that they can see if thats actually a face or if its just a mountain with craters. But they might get me wrong and thats ok but as long as they have a better camera to explain how or what i'm right about. Like in the beginning of this article it said that they had take pictures in 1976, 1998, and in 2001 but all of those pictures are on cameras that make pictures blury and in order to see if the picture was actually a face they had to do something to make that picure clearer than it shows. 
1825	"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", uses many scientific facts, data, and explanations to support their idea of exploring Venus. In the passage, many examples are given of why scientists would want to explore the possibilities of the contents of Venus despite all the dangers. "
1826	Venus' relation to Earth is significant because it is the closest example of another planet like Earth. 
1827	. Reducing car usage by building public transportation and smart suburbs would be ideal. 
1828	Smog in Paris, France and Bogota, Columbia have reached record pollutions and both cities do not want to deal with it any longer. Robert Duffer writes about how the Paris government enforced a new rule which allowed both even and odd numbered license plates to drive on a certain day and would alternate everyday. This was very beneficial, however some people needed transportation but would be fined $31 if their car was used on the wrong day. Being that Paris is one of the most famous capitals of the world, one would expect to see more smog than usual. Andrew Selsky also writes that in Bogota, Columbia, a day without cars was put into place in the 1990's and still continues today. Once a year, buses and taxis are the only transportation allowed in the whole city. If not obeyed, there would be a $25 fine. This day was put into place as an improvement campaign which also benefitted the city. Bike paths and smooth sidewalks were put in and during rush hour has cut the traffic in half. It also opened up restaurants and shopping malls which were widely used by the public. 
1829	few people will be buying gas or diesel fuel for their cars. Elisabeth Rosenthal tells her audience that Vauban, Germany has an upscale community where nearly everyone has given up their cars. Here, people sold their cars just so that they could buy a house in peace without having to hear traffic jams and honking horns all the time. Many say that this environment makes them happier because it is so peaceful. 70% of the community do nott own cars and the ones that do must leave it in a large parking garage outside the developement  that is purchased with the home. In another article, also written by Elisabeth Rosenthal, discusses America and the recent  decrease of the amount of driven by a single person. Research shows that the amount driven in 1995 is about the same as the amount driven in 2013. This is due to environmental protectionists who walk evrywhere they go and due to the dangers of driving. There are fewer young adults driving today as well; in eight years, the amount has decreased 23% 
1830	To acess what one needs in the world today, many would think one needs a car. Currently, cars are a big part of transportation for many people. However, they are also major contributers to negative environmental impact as well as the decline of cities public areas and transportation. 
1831	A decrease in the number of cars on streets and highways would lead to positive improvments in public spaces, 
1832	public transportation, 
1833	the environment as a whole. 
1834	"In ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", author Elisabeth Rosenthal shares the story of Vauban, Germany and their efforts to reduce greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emmisions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" The impact of these gas emmsions is incredibly negative on cities. They make the environment unstable and unsafe for a large number of people. These numbers could easily be reduced if fewer people chose to rely on cars as their mode of transportation. In some places the pollution caused by automobiles is so high that the government is stepping in to assist in the management of city spaces. In ""Paris bans driving due to smog"", author Robert Duffer explains this specific situation in Paris, France. ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city. On Monday motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day."" The effects of this temporary ban were also shared. ""Congestion was down 60% in the capital of France, after five-days of intesifying smog."" It is easy to see that just a small reduction of vehicles created a significant change. "
1835	"In ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky, improvments to Bogota, Colombia as a result of less car usage is expaned upon. ""The day without cars is part of an improvement campaign that began in Bogota in the mid-1990s. It has seen the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, the most of any Latin American city, according to Mockus, the city's mayor. Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have been cropped up."" Cities are beggining to cater to the needs of those who don't  use cars. Their negative impact on city streets is finally being recognized, and many are taking action to improve aspects where they live other than roads. In ""The End of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, the author discusses the goals of the United States and its major figures to reduce total reliance on cars. In this article Bill Ford, executive chairman of Ford Motor Company shares his hopes. ""He proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commerical and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected netowork to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety."" Many are striving to make public spaces more accessable to those who choose more concious methods of transport. "
1836	"In ""The End of Car Culutre"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal the decreasing numbers of people getting licenses and cars is discussed. ""But America's love affair with its vehicles seems to be cooling. When adjusted for population growth, the number of miles driven in the United States peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis done by Doug Short of Advisor Perspectives, an investment reseach comapny."" In this article, the disregard full time use of vehichles is also shown. ""The Internet makes telecommunicating possible and allows people to feel more connected without driving to meet friends. The renewal of center cities has made the suburbs less appealing and has drawn epty nesters back in. Likewise the rise in cellphones and car-pooling apps has facilitated more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work. With all these changes, people who stopped car commuting as a result of the recession may find less reason to resume the habit."" People today can get access to a vehicle on command. Different resources make the constant use of cars unneccesary. "
1837	The decrease in usage of and reliance on cars is important and positively impactful. As number of cars on the road continues to go down, so do global issues such as the deterioration of the environment. Communities grow to orient themselves around public spaces accessable to all. Getting a significant number of automobiles off the road plays a huge role in inciting change that benefits a wide array of people in the way of work, time, money, and more, in communities and worldwide. 
1838	Although all students could possibly find something they're interested in when it comes to after school activities, such as clubs or sports, 
1839	Have you ever come to the conclusion that not every student can even maintain good grades at school? For some children, it's harder to balance school work and their everyday life alone, but if you add an extracurricular activity to their plate of responsibilities, it may be too much for them to handle. For a principal to make extracurricular activities a necessity at school, is not very considerate. As an adult you must realize that not every person, let alone children, can handle the same work load as others can. 
1840	Even though research has shown that extracurricular activities can be very beneficial for people, as it pertains to their physical, and mental well-being, it can also be damaging if too much work is placed upon one person alone. 
1841	Stress is a very common factor in a child's life, and the majority of it is from life at home, and the excessive amount of work received at school. But in comparison, some kids can handle the load, and like the responsibility given to them. Not all children are like that though, and that is what the principal fails to realize. Although the principal may not have come to light about the amount of stress that could potentially be put on the students, the gesture to make the activities a necessity was most likely at their best interest at heart. 
1842	For the kids that work well under pressure, or have the capability to handle the challenges they face, the change in the schools priorities for the students probably won't affect them as much. Although only one extracurricular activity would be required, not all students could be able to wisely manage their time to fit the activity in their schedule. Also, maybe not all students would be able to find something they enjoy with the options given at their school. 
1843	If someone were to make it a priority for all students to participate in an extracurricular activity, it would be extremely recommended for the person to make the activity choices an exceptionally wide variety, so that it is more likely for students to find the things they enjoy to do. With the exception of making sure that there would be an activity to match each students interest, the idea would not be too bad. But in the same breath, that'd require some type of survey or application of some type, that every student must take in order to find out their interests, so that way making the activities wont be as difficult. Although keep in mind, that not every student may want to participate regardless of whether or not there is an activity they might enjoy.  
1844	"There are some students that just don't like the idea of doing extra work when it's not required. It's not necessarily that they're lazy, but they just dont see the importance of going out of their way to do something that they can't see the immediate benefits to. Enforcing the change could arouse some anger in a vast majority of students, and possibly parents, but if the students are given an option to not participate in an extracurricular activity, things would most likely run a lot smoother. Most people would call these types of kids, ""average"" due to the fact that they settle for the amount of work given, and typically don't want to exceed expectations. Perhaps making them participate in beneficial activities wouldn't hurt, they just need to be a little more open minded to the idea at hand. "
1845	the idea as a whole would potentially cause a lot of stress to the principal, considering that not every child will have the same perspective on the idea, nor will their parents. 
1846	Yes, the motion being taken will have several benefits, and several stressful altercations, but at the end of the day everyone is different, and not everyone is going to have the same opinion when it comes to this situation. Even though the principal is only asking each student to participate in at least one extracurricular activity, it still may be too much to ask of some kids, considering their life outside of school, and what they find important in their lives as far as activities go. But maybe enforcing this act could open not only the students' eyes, but the parents as well, that trying new things isn't always such a bad idea, sometimes we just need a little push to get us started. But despite all the possible benefits of the idea, it still probably shouldn't necessarily be a requirement for all students to participate in an extracurricular activity. You never know how much stress someone deals with just by handling their personal life, one activity may not seem like much to you, but for some people one activity could be a handful. Forcing the students to participate in activities that they may not like, could possibly lead to a decrease in social skills, instead of an increase.           
1847	"In recent years many citicens have stated that the so called ""face on mars"" is a martion monument. Well I have but one question for those few citicens. Do you have any proof? "
1848	there is nor was there ever any real evidence supporting the martion monument claim. However there is evidence proveing that the face is realy a mesa! 
1849	Three years later we recieved the best results possible. the photo not only showed no carvings but it also showed that there was no face at all! 
1850	While owning a car may seem like the most important possession a person can have, it is becoming more beneficial to find a way to live without them. Cities around the world are turning in their cars, even if just for a day 
1851	it brings plenty of advantages to make up for what could be seen by some as a troublesome lack of easy transportation. 
1852	Both the environment and and the well being of the people are grateful for the new change, 
1853	the reduction of air pollution and smog has become a major advantage in the limitation of car usage. 
1854	"After suffering through days of near-record pollution, Paris, France had composed a temporary driving ban in an attempt to clear the air, according to Rober Duffner in ""Paris Bans Driving due to Smog"". The passage goes further to explain that the ban followed five days of smog that rivalled the likes of Beijing, China, which is widely recognized for being one of the most polluted cities in the world. Exceptions to the ban were made for hybrids and cars carrying three or more passengers, and public transportation was made to be free. Once the smog cleared enough, the ban was lifted and citizens were allowed back to the road, but the reduction of auto usage was what saved the air from becoming overly polluted. Moreover, in Bogota, Colombia, citizens participate in a car-free day, entitled Day Without Cars, once a year to reduce smog in the cities, according to ""Car-free Day is Spinning Into a Big Hit in Bogota"" by Andrew Selsky. Violators are charged with $25 fines, but, according to Bogota Mayor Antanas Mockus, the people participate, and the turnouts are large. This day without cars, which has begun to spread to other Colombian cities, is a fantastic way to reduce both air pollution and stress, and is a part of a campaign to oversee the construction of 118 miles of bicycle paths, which, according to Mayor Mockus, is the most of any city in Latin America. "
1855	All in all, there are many advantages that could easily come with limiting car usage, including the reduction of smog and a more pleasent lifestyle for the citizens who decide to limit or cease their auto usage. While transportation issues may arise when people begin to give up their motorized vehicle, or if they decide to not purchase one in the first place, as many already have, a quick purchase of a bike or the use of public transit can solve at least some of them.    
1856	The majority of Americans have the luxury of owning a car. A car of course, seems like a useful innovation. It gets you places quickly and efficently, and is easier than walking. Yet so many people drive cars that the roads get congested and clogged easily as the cars just idle in the road waiting for the traffic jam to loosen up. Car usage causes the enviroment to decline and an increase in air poulltion, 
1857	it would be a great idea to lower car usage since it is so detrimental to the health of the enviroment and the health of the populace. 
1858	An advantage to reducing car usage is a more benifical enviroment and a better overall health standard. 
1859	"Cars also cause poulltion and smog to hang over cities causing the air to be full of harmful chemicals, endagering peoples health and also causing a rise in asthma for the populace that lives inside the city. In places like Beijing,China smog and poulltion from cars cause the air to be so foggy and dirty that you cannot even see the sky. ""Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.""(Source 2). When Paris was accosted by the same problem they solved it by a temporary ban on driving to clear the air. Without so many people driving cars we wouldn't have these many issues with smog and it's effect on the enviroment. "
1860	Driving not only creates an issue with air pollution but also with water pollution and the contamination of the earth. 
1861	"Many people agree with the statment  that without cars their lives are easier and less stressful due to the fact that they no longer have to worry about traffic jams and car crashes as well as any other dangerous event that can happen while driving. This excerpt from the third source, shows a man's reply to the event Day Without Cars that takes place in Bogota,Colombia once a year. ""'It's a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,' said businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza.""(Source 3). This excerpt only furthers my point that less car usage causes people to be more calm and less worried or stressed. ""'When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,' said Heidrun Walter"" (Source 1). This quote from source 1 which discusses a suburb in Germany that is car-free. This blurb shows another example of someone who became happier without a car. "
1862	By improving public transport we reduce car usage which improves the enviroment and quality of life.  
1863	"Less car usage will help the enviroment as well as lower stress. ""Transportation is the second largest source of America's emmisons."" (Source 4). By eliminating uneeded car usage and introducing more public transportation and alternate means of transport we will be eliminating one of the greatest causes of greenhouse gas emissions in America. The advantages of eliminating car usage is less pollution, healthier living and a less stressful life. "
1864	Many school officials have been questioning whether or not students should participate in extracurricular activities. Extracurricular activities like sports, working on the yearbook, or serving in the student council can contribute a lot to a student's view on school. In addition to this, students will pay more attention to their grades and behavior. 
1865	In school, many students dislike to learn new things. By having one extracurricular activity, students will have a great way of learning new things 
1866	Sports are something we usually do during gym class, but in gym class at our school we move fast through any unit that we do. Having at least one extracurricular activity will give students a chance to enjoy participating in sports that they like. Also students will get to learn more about this sport and even later on join a team. There are a lot of creative students at my school. Students who want to learn about photography, drawing, and constructing things will have a great opportunity to by joining a extracurricular activity that involves this. I would like to add on that when I joined a drawing club, I learned many new things like blending colors. Additionally, training on your mindset is very important. By having a extracurricular activity like chess or board games, students will get to learn how to play board games that they have been wanting to try. Learning new things from extracurricular activities could be very helpful to students because later on they might have a chance to use this information. 
1867	Learning all day can be very hard on some students. By joining a extracurricular activity, students will be able to have a break from learning all day 
1868	Many students by the end of the day are very tired after learning for so long. By participating in an extracurricular activity students will clear their mindset. In addition to this, having a break from learning can make students feel more relieved and they will pay more attention during class. If students decide to join extracurricular activities like drawing, they will be able to calm down. It has been a proven fact that drawing will make you calm down, so by doing a extracurricular activity, students will be at ease and contribute more during class. Learning all day is very stressful and takes a lot of energy, so therefore students should participate in calm and relaxing extracurricular activities that will give them a break from school and at the same time help them pay more attention toward school. 
1869	Socializing is something that some shy students struggle with. Extracurricular activities give students a chance to make more friends and socialize 
1870	As a shy person, when I first came to my school I was struggling to find some good friends that I could trust. Later on I decided to join a chess club and a drawing club and I made great friends. Joining a extracurricular activity can give shy students a way to to train on socializing, meaning that they could practice how to socialize and even overcome their fear of socializing by talking to people in their extracurricular activity. At school, some students who are not shy can be very loud and disruptive during class. If these students join a extracurricular activity, they will not want to socialize as much during class because they will have a extracurricular activity that they could join and talk and share their opinions there. Extracurricular activities are very helpful towards students who want to make some friends and socialize, so therefore making students participate in at least one is necessary. 
1871	Students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it is very helpful for them. Students get to learn many new things and this might even help them chose their future career. Learning new things can be very tiring to some students and they might not even be able to handle so much information, so by joining a extracurricular activity students will get to have a break from school. To add on, students will will have the chance to socialize and make more friends. Learning can be very difficult for some students, but by participating in at least one extracurricular activity, students will be able to enjoy learning new things, get a break from learning all day, and will get to socialize and make more friends. Therefore students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because this activity will help them with their school life and their grades. 
1872	Summer projects should be teacher-designed because it ensures that students will work efficiently 
1873	that the assignments will be safe and appropriate.  
1874	Having set rules and requirements created by teachers, ensures that students will complete the tasks to a high level. During the summer, students would rather not have educational work to focus on, but projects created by the teacher enforces these students to do so. If these projects were student-designed, it could potentially allow them to finesse the system, and create a project that does not require much thinking and work. Student-designed projects also leaves room for error. Projects constructed by students leaves the door open for many mistakes, which will ultimately hurt the student in the end. This prevents students from working efficiently and fully understanding the topic they are working on. The goal of teacher-designed projects is to not control the students, but to make sure that the students are obtaining knowledge, understand the assignment, and are producing high quality work. Students may be confused or have numerous of questions with student-designed projects since there are no specific guidelines and rules, so having teacher-designed projects are ideal because they explicitly state what they are looking for. 
1875	If students had the ability to come up with their own projects, it gives them an opportunity to select a topic that could be unsafe or not school appropriate. This is especially important for science projects or English assignments. Giving students the power to choose their projects could be risky when it comes to these two subjects. For science projects, students could end up harming themselves with unsafe chemicals or substances because a lack of a rubric and criteria created by the teacher. For English assignments, students might choose controversial topics that are not appropriate for the school environment, but would not know due to a lack of strict guidelines. The possibility of projects being unsafe and inappropriate are not likely if they are designed by teachers. 
1876	Some may argue that assignments should be student-designed because it allows the student to express themselves creatively through their work. By displaying their creativity and thought process, it makes the idea of having work over the summer more enjoyable. 
1877	However, having projects that are created by the student leaves room for interpretation, which could confuse students, and may take them in the wrong direction. 
1878	In addition, some students may not be that creative, and cannot come up with a project on their own. 
1879	Teacher-designed assignments still allow students to show what they know, but with stricter guidelines to ensure that quality work is being produced from the students. If students are allowed to design their own projects, it might result in an end product that does not meet the standard of work it should, especially since students would rather not complete work in the summer. Because of these issues and flaws, having student-design projects is not a wise choice. 
1880	Touchdown! I just won the biggest game of the year. My team run on the field and we jump up and down in joy. This would not have happened if my principal did not make us take a school activity. 
1881	I think that it is a good idea to make us take a school extracurricular activity. 
1882	although teachers can make sure students doing what they need; I personally believe that it should be student 
1883	students can make it more a peeling  
1884	it helps builds creative students 
1885	who better to make a project to keep students attention the the students themselves. Because while students are on break many do not have people to push them and make sure they are doing their work so it has to be a project that they would want to do on their own. and if a blunder is made the student can't say they didn't understand because the students designed the projects. This will be a way to grab the attention of whoever grades the project, like a hook in a essay.  
1886	Yes schools are a place of learning, but while students are in school they are building creative thoughts that are just waiting to be used. giving the students the chance to design their summer summer project helps give the schools notice of what future creator you are putting into the world. If the students are creating their own summer project it teaches then about Independence, and that they don't need a teacher standing over top of them to do their work. With student designing their own project it will make great business skills. 
1887	After all the students in our school system now are our future town council, school bored leaders, and teachers. so I'm sure the school bored would be pleased to hear that while students are going on their summer break they are not only doing but designing their summer project. Students after the summer can come to tell the public about there how designing their own project helps them in independence and self learning. Although many students may not care for it it will help them keep what they learn and learn new thing researching and designing their summer project. 
1888	Summer is like a brainwash. Students seem to forget everything they learned in school that year over the summer. To try and combat this, many teachers assign summer projects so the students don't fall behind on any of their learning. Students are often upset by this, wanting their summer to be fun and stress free. Teacher designed projects are often long and tedious making them boring to do. 
1889	The summer projects should be student-designed. 
1890	Having the projects be student-designed allows for a greater range of creativity 
1891	 Allowing for summer projects to be student designed makes for a greater range of creativity 
1892	A greater range of creativity would encite students to finish their projects faster if they were given a wider range of mediums to work with instead of just paper and pencil, or a computer program. Even when it's not over the summer, being assigned a project where I can make a poster or create a diorama instead of writing a paper is already much more exciting to me because I'm given a bunch of different mediums to work with. I personally prefer creating something big and artsy to sitting down and churning out a paper within a set time frame. The process of creating something huge feel much more satisfying because I can visibly see when I am done. Completing a paper still has a feeling of satisfaction but the overall feeling is dulled because no creativity was released. A greater range of creativity also allows for a much more interesting presentation. A differentation of styles in projects makes the overall project much more interesting and increases the chances of students paying attention for longer during those presentations.  
1893	Completion of the project is thought to be most important. Allowing students to control how the project is completed is much more student oriented 
1894	A student oriented project should be more fun and less stressful as to not add anything more on top of an already heavy workload. Letting students decide how the project is presented and what the rubric should entail makes the students not only happier, but less stressed as a result. If the students can control what they want to do in the project or how the final product should be, it could help immensely with the overall students happiness and create a stronger student community. 
1895	The mindset for summer is just fun, fun, fun. Adding a summer project dampens that mindset. It becomes a burden for students to deal with. No one wants to do schoolwork over the summer, summer is the time for fun! Allowing students to create a student designed project would create an overall better mindset towards how summer project are viewed. I know that I don't want to do school work over the summer. Giant math packets, books to read, papers to write, it's all so tedious and I always end up pushing it off til August, where I'm then rushing to get it all done in time for the start of school. If I were to be given a project that I could control, it would already seem so much better because I would be in full control over what I did for the project or how I approached a problem I encountered with it. It's important to keep a healthy mindset in school so you don't burn yourself out 
1896	Summer is seen as a time to destress and have fun and creating a better mindset towards student project by making them student designed is extremely crucial to that. 
1897	When I think of school projects, I think of teachers handing them out at the end of a quarter or towards the end of school to be completed over the summer. Projects are a way to either boost or bring down your grade, depending on how you do. Because of that effect on grades, important projects tend to stress students out. When students are given more control over a project it immediately takes stress off the student because they automatically control how their project is made and presented. Teacher designed projects are made to showcase how well teachers teach their students. If more students get a higher grade on a project, the credibility of that teacher goes up. They are viewed as a better teacher overall. While teacher designed projects might have more academic results, having projects be student-designed creates a wider range of creativity, control over how the project is executed, and makes a more postive mindset for students. 
1898	Second reason is because due to the lack of concentration while driving being the phone while operating on a moving vehicle is one of the main causes of most wrecks in the United States, which is the leading cause to distraction in a car is a cell phone. 
1899	Everyday there's always someone whose severely injured or either worst end up dead because of the use of using their phone while operating a vehicle of any kind. 
1900	Research indicates that students forget almost one-third of what they learned during the school year over summer. Without consistent reinforcement of learned material over the summer, students lose essential knowledge about concepts that are going to be built upon in the next school year. In response to that, schools have started to require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break to prevent minimal loss of information. These projects will allow students to retain knowledge and learn over the break so they are prepared for the next school year. 
1901	Teachers are educated in their field of study and pass that knowledge to their students; they are aware of the information and requirements for students to know for the next school year. 
1902	By having teachers design the summer projects, they can readdress concepts that students need practice with or struggled with last school year so they will not be troubled by it in the future. For example, in the book  Counting By 7s , the main character excells at history. Although she excells in that subject, she has trouble with other subjects. A teacher-designed summer project for her may be focused on math and writing while her student-designed project would have been based on history, which may help her retain that knowledge, but does not help her with subjects she truly needs practice with. In addition, teacher-designed summer projects can have students learn new material that will be used in the upcoming school year. Teachers are aware of what will be taught in a course next whereas students are not. These summer projects would allow students to prepare ahead of time for the school year by reaffirming previous knowledge and learning new information directed towards the course. Many educational resources are only for teacher use or are not accessible to students prior to the school year, such as syallbuses and requirements for a course, Khan Academy, and other study sites, allowing teachers to be more effective in designing summer projects than students. Having the summer to complete teacher-designed summer projects will allow students to expand their knowledge on topics they need to learn or struggled with so they are prepared for the coming school year. 
1903	If students were to design summer projects, they may be unintentionally flawed or incorrect because the students are not experts on the subject like teachers. 
1904	Student-designed summer projects may allow students to express their creativity, but can ultimately lead them to learn the information incorrectly. Teachers are guides and resources for students to follow when learning information and asking questions. Frederick Douglass, a slave in the 1800s, became self-educated by looking at other students' papers and reading magazines and books. Although he helped himself become more knowledgable about the world through the new information he obtained, he learned some information wrong because he was not guided or corrected by teachers. Student-designed projects can be precarious because teachers cannot correct students if the project is designed inccorectly. If the project were teacher-designed, then the correct information will be present and learned by the students. The summer projects being flawed can also hurt students. By learning the information incorrectly, they are likely to repeat the same mistakes, making it harder to correct them. In the book  Fish in a Tree , a girl with dyslexia struggled with writing because the words kept moving. She got into the habit of writing letters a specific way so that when a teacher noticed and corrected her, it was hard for her to stop the habit of writing letters incorrectly. Student-designed projects can give students the freedom to express their creativity through learning and designing, but this also allows for students to do their project incorrectly because they learned the material wrong, leading them to repeat the same mistakes because the teacher is not aware of how the students are designing their projects. 
1905	Summer is the period of relaxation and taking a break from school for students. Giving the freedom of designing summer projects to students allows them to make the project easy to complete, preventing them from challenging themselves and learning new information through exploration of the project. Students can manipulate student-designed summer projects by creating a project that is not difficult to do, therefore not pushing or challenging them to learn new information. One example of this was demonstrated by a study of a homeschooled family in the Midwest. The parents gave their children the freedom of designing their own cirriculum for education based on their interests. Instead of centering their cirriculum and challenging themselves with subjects like algebra or chemistry, they studied games and did not necessarily learn anything. By having teacher-designed projects, teachers can challenge the students so they learn the new information about subjects for the coming year, which fulfills the requirements of learning over the break 
1906	Teacher-designed projects would challenge students to learn while student-designed projects can be made easy for the student to complete. 
1907	Teacher-designed summer projects can prepare students for the coming year by addressing upcoming subbjects and topics students have previously struggled with. In addition, it prevents students from learning information wrong or doing the project incorrectly by giving them specific guidelines. These projects also ensures that students are challenged and learn new information. Teacher-designed summer projects would be more beneficial for students. 
1908	Imagine. Summer is here, and the dreadful school year is finally over. You're prepared to grab your swimsuits and go to the beach and actually enjoy your time off from learning. However, your blissful period is interrupted with anguishing agony as you realize you were assigned a summer project to complete. We've all been there, mourning over the fact that we received one more assignment to do for school. We are reluctant to start the projects as they seem pointless and a form of busywork for us; however, summer projects are designed to assure continuous learning through engaging tasks. 
1909	Although teacher-designed projects can be seen as desirable, summer projects should be student-designed 
1910	Giving students the freedom to learn about topics that interests them far outweighs the notion of just finishing an assignment. In my high school experience, I tend to remember projects that I was truly interested in, rather than the monotonous ones designed by teachers (that solely get work out of you). Projects are meant to be engaging, so that later down in life you can recall the learning experience. This difference proves that creative work fosters quality rather than quantity. Furthermore, a teacher-designed project inhibits a student's potential to express their creative mindset. By receiving a topic and a guideline on how one should complete a project, a student becomes mentally set on pursuing that one path, disregarding all other options. This mental block of creativity can be harmful to a growing teenager as the advancement of society is dependent on creative thinkers which student-designed projects help create. 
1911	Another reason why summer projects should be student-designed is the fact that it engages students to be self-reliant. 
1912	Given the freedom to pursue one's take on a subject, helps foster self-confidence. In my high school experience, doing a personal research that was interesting really helped create a sense of pride and accomplishment. Being confident leads to trusting one's ability rather than relying on others;and in our competitive society for careers, self-reliance is extremely important. Furthermore, allowing students to pursue their own designs lets them mature into adulthood. The apex of self reliance is adulthood and self learning is meant to teach and prepare students for their future. By removing the dependency of a teacher when doing a project, self support truly shines through, giving students hands on experience on the hallmark of adulthood. This is similar to the concept of parents not supporting a baby for too long so they can learn to walk on their own. 
1913	 In conclusion, summer projects should be student-designed rather than teacher-designed as it fosters creativity and self-reliance. Given the freedom to pursue their own path, students not only learn more effectively but also become more unique. Letting students be unique allows for a desirable diverse community in which society becomes enriched by. Therefore, everyone should aim for topics that interest them when they are given the chance, as that is when humanity truly learns at its best. 
1914	Students are usually on their phones and doing other mindless tasks during summer break, and they don't stimulate their brains. As a result, some schools assign summer projects to ensure that their students learn over the summer and are better prepared for the next school year. These schools debate on assigning teacher-designed projects, which have specific guidelines, or student-designed projects, which allow for more creative freedom. 
1915	students would be able to personalize their projects, 
1916	the projects would be more enjoyable, 
1917	the students would put in more effort into their products. 
1918	For example, in an interior design class, the summer project could be to design the students' dream house. One student may excel in drawing, so they could draw their dream house. Another student may excel in graphic design, so they could create a three-dimensional model of their dream house on a computer. Lastly, another student may like Legos, so they could build their dream house out of Legos. On the other hand, teacher-designed projects would minimize the creative freedom because they would set specific guidelines on how they want their students to complete it. All in all, students can complete their projects using the unique skills they have with student-designed projects.  
1919	Summer break is a time for students to have fun. When a teacher designs a project, there are usually set guidelines on how they want the project, which sometimes isn't what students would enjoy. This would make it difficult for students to find the motivation to complete their projects, especially over summer break. On the other hand, with student-designed projects, students would be able to personalize their projects, so they could use their own interests to complete it. When students are able to individualize their projects, they find it more enjoyable to complete since they would include aspects that they enjoy and minimize aspects of the project they could potentially dislike. For example, in the previously mentioned interior design summer project, the student who excels in drawing could dislike using computers. If the teacher had required the dream house to be made on the computer, the drawer could find it difficult to finish the project because they don't enjoy using computers. In contrast, if the drawer was able to design their own project, then they could draw their dream house while having fun. 
1920	Generally, students put more effort into the subjects that they enjoy. Similarly, if students are able to design their own projects, they would enjoy completing the projects and work harder on them. If the previously mentioned interior design teacher required everyone to build their dream house out of Legos, the student who draws and the student who enjoys graphic design would enjoy the project less and find little motivation to complete it over the summer. As a result, the drawer and graphic designer would put minimal effort into their Lego dream house, for they may just build a house with little detail and minimal unique thinking. On the other hand, if the dream house project was a student-designed project, the students would put a lot of effort into creating their dream house since they are able to design it with the skills that they have and enjoy using. 
1921	Some may argue that students could design the summer projects so they require minimum effort since they want to complete their projects as quickly as possible. 
1922	However, when you give students creative freedom, they are more likely to put in extra effort because they would enjoy their projects more. 
1923	Schools that require summer projects should assign student-designed projects because students are able to use their unique skills and interests to complete these projects. Additionally, students would have more fun completing these projects since they are allowed to express their own creativeness, which helps motivate the students to complete it during summer break. Lastly, students are more likely to work harder on their projects because they would find their student-designed projects more enjoyable to complete. 
1924	Imagine checking the notification of your cell phone and in the blink of an eye you get into a car accident.Texting and driving is the act of texting, checking social media, composing a message,emailing, or using the internet while driving a vehicle.Texting and driving is an issue that has resulted in car crashes and even death. Picking up a phone while you are behind the wheel could put yourself and others in danger. People should be cautious and know the risk of picking up a cell phone while they are driving.Cell phones have become and is a very big distraction. 
1925	Drivers should not be able to use them or even have them in their hand,lap, or etic while they are in the act of operating a vehicle.  
1926	The cell phone has become so much of a distraction to the point where people are immune to picking up their phone every time they receive a notification. 
1927	"The disturbance of a notification on the phone has been the cause of man accidents and deaths caused by car wrecks. Statistics show 6 out of 10 teenegers have been in car crashes due to distracted driving. In the text located on www.teensafe.com it shares the story of 25 year old Natasha Boggs of Ohio and how texting and driving affected her life and others. It states "" Ohio woman Natasha Boggs, 25, killed two 14-year-old girls and severely injured a 15-year-old boy when she was texting and driving.""The article also tells the story of 20 year old Dillon Jackson a pickup truck driver that was distracted by his cell phone which took other innocent lives. The text states ""A driver of a pickup truck killed a whopping 13 individuals in a Texas crash in the spring of 2017. 20-year-old Jack Dillon Young was behind the wheel of his truck and was texting while driving, causing him to cross the center line several times.""  This informs you on how cell phone distraction could risk the lives of not only yourself but others as well. ? people are injured or killed due to cell phone distraction. Cell phone disturbances have a big impact on car crashes and deaths. "
1928	Cell phone distractions are very dangerous when someone is operating a vehicle. Distracted driving can include things like eating, drinking, talking to others while driving, and etc. Out of all those distractions cell phone interaction is the most common and dangerous. 
1929	"When paying attention to your cell phone it takes away the attention you need to focus on the road and drive safely. In a text on www.wikepedia.com it says "" Using a cell phone while driving increases the driver's risk of causing a crash. Drivers are distracted, decreasing the driver's awareness on the road, leading to more car crashes."" This simply means that the use of the cell phone while driving can result in a dangerous outcome. It is also said that ""4.6 secondspass when a driver's eyes leave the road to text at 55mph, it's like driving the length of a football field blind."" When a driver's eye is taken off the road the chance of wrecking another car or even running off the side of the road and harming yourself. The dangerous outcomes could be losing control of the wheel, crashing, running off the side of the road, harming others of all ages, running into objects ( poles, signs,cines,etc.), and the worst of all, death. Cell phone disturbance can be very dangerous when driving which is another cell phone should not be used while driving. "
1930	People should consider certain things before picking up a phone. Things can be done to lower the accidents caused by the distraction of a cell phone. Companies have taken a huge step to decrease the number of wrecks caused by phones. 
1931	"Cell phone companies such as AT&T realized how big cell phones are distractions to drivers so they come up with programs. For example, a big program today is "" It could wait "". On the site www.independentmotors.com it describes the can wait program. It quotes ""AT&T itself has helped drive these conversations with its It Can Wait campaign, which has seen more than 7 million people take the campaign's pledge to drive more safely. The company also launched its DriveMode app, which keeps all phone calls and texts quiet while you are driving. The app turns on automatically when it detects that the user is moving faster than 15 MPH and turns off shortly after it detects that the user has stopped."" "
1932	This shows how companies have noticed the danger of cell phones and have taken action onto fixing it such just like AT&T which is a huge cell phone company. 
1933	"Another program example is the Stop Texting AND Driving Distracted, or STANDD program. This program was launched by a lady who lost her son due to a texting a driving incident . The website states "" Like a few other organizations on this list, STANDD has its own app for iOS and Android smartphones. It starts up as soon as your engine does, and as long as you're moving more than 10 miles per hour, the free app deactivates any texts and calls that you receive, letting the caller know that you're unavailable with an auto-message."". This goes to show that there are ways to put an end to all the horrible incidents caused by texting and driving but it is all up to you. Programs have been made, apps have been released, and signs are around you everyday to remind you not to text and drive so do what's best and focus more on the road and not on your phone. "
1934	A simple message or text could wait. If people paid as much attention to the roads than their phones there would be less wrecks or car tragedies. Cell phones are huge distractions on drivers. Drivers are put in harm once they pick up their phones to check a text, post on social media, change songs, make videos, and etc. Cell phones while driving is like taking a risk. People are put in life or death situations once being distracted by their phones when operating a vehicle. In conclusion the use of cell phones should be prohibited while driving.    
1935	Nowadays, technology and science became one of important parts in human life, it makes life runs easier. With human's intelligent, technology is improved day by day. Many things are dicovered, or invented that we don't even know about their appearances. One of them is the Facial Action Coding System also known as FACS, which technology could identify human emotions was created by Dr. Paul Eckman. 
1936	In my opinion, I think this techonology is useful, especially in order to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom. 
1937	Life contains many differences, includes positive and negative things, truthful or untruthful. Some people said emotions are never lie. We could figure out the statue of someone by looking at their face, and that's true. However, life is something really complicated, sometimes things in front of you don't mean like what you think. Likewise, even though the expression from people face is the most authenic, when they are trying to hide their feelings, we literally cannot know their real emotions. The changing of teenager is issue that causes headache for parents, their characters aren't the same like before, their emotions are changed. Both of them could not find the common speech, and push them further each other. That is the moment, the childrens easily fall in the darkness. For real instance, children or students aren't agree about their parent's thinking, or the education from school completely. Most of them don't say it out, or talk back. It's really affects about effective in studying and their plans in the future. 
1938	The creation of FACS is a way to solve this problem, it could read student's thinkings, from that parents and teachers could understand about expected of their kids, or their students. 
1939	Therefore, they could modify their ideas, lessons to able to suitable. It leads to success in learning of teachers and students; or it could make kids and parents get closer, and decrease the bad things happen. 
1940	The use of the technology can read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable. It helps to understand students feelings, or reactions about the lessons, thus the teachers can recognize what are things helpful, and unhelpful. From that, the effective in studying will be increased. Besides that, it also brings advanges in communication between parents and child. The adults could realize their kids are struggling with something or not. Then, they could find the ways to share, or help. In order to not let anything bad could occur, as having negative thinkings and lead to suicide. 
1941	Lastly, the author supports their idea by telling us how we are going to uncover more information without loosing more. 
1942	"They explain that NASA has a theory that sending anything electronic to it will die off within hours, where as sending parts from the 1800's - 1940's won't. I know this becaues in the text it states that, ""NASA is studying other approches to studying Venus. For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lested about three weeks...These devices were first envisiond in the 1800's and played an important role in the 1940's during the war...but, these devices made calculations by using gears and levers without electricity...By comparison, systems that use mechanical pats can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces""(paragraph 7). This means that hypothetically NASA could send older tech and find a way to uncover more information. "
1943	"Therefore, the author supports his idea, ""that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents,"" by giving us multiple reasons why we need the knowlage, how it affects us and how we will accomplish that. First, by telling us that Venus is like our twin planet and learning what happened we could adapt. Secondly, by showing us that we are can prevent our own downfall. Lastly, the author tells us how NASA expects to pull this off. "
1944	In the booming world today, transportaion is essential. Trying to imagine life without cars for some people is like trying to imagine life without food or water, but cars arent ass essential as we think.  
1945	But even if you drive a smart car or hybrid, emissions from these cars still affect the world around us. Lowered car use would help this improve. 
1946	"People in a samll town of VAUBAN, Germany have already stopped use of cars. People report to be ""Happier without them."" "
1947	Less cars mean less greenhouse gas emissions, which inturn help our environment. It also leads to less stress and deaths among the people in the city. Less cars are the future of our world, and its not too late to start to help our environment and to help better ourselves.   
1948	The science of emotion recognition is complex and is becoming exponentially more complex the further a topic is being disscused. In the realm of arguing weather the use of emotional recognition technology should be used in a classroom can be a very difficult tquestion. On one side, you can say it may invade privacy, but on the other hand, it could help teachers see if students are understanding the topic. The question still lies on which one is more important for both the student and the teacher. 
1949	In my opinion, this technology should be implemented into classrooms internationally 
1950	because it will help students learn more effectivley, 
1951	also it will enhance the teachers teaching ability when they know where they're students are going array. 
1952	This technology could be very benificial for students across the globe. The ability for a piece of technology to understand your emotions could come in handy. There are many outgoing students, but there are also many introverted students. Some students may not feel confident enough to ask for something to be repeated, so they may simply sit at their desks puzzeled for the rest of the class, while a simple question could've avoided this. If this technology is instituted, it will automatically know when a student isn't confident on the information and alert the teacher. By doing this, the introverted student won't be confused for very long and the topic could be revisited without the student to have to personally ask. It not only will help introverted students, but students across the board. Every student will benifit form this technology and will display in their grades. With this technology, the students acedemic achievements will expand exponentially. 
1953	Becuase of this ability for teachers to understand their emotions, the quick turn around of revisiting the topic and teaching it a little differently could help the students absorb all the information, especially the information that they mau have not conprehended initally. 
1954	This technology will be very valuable for the students for both their enjoyment throughout school becuase of the reduced stress, and their improvents in acedemic grades. 
1955	This technology is not only bennifical to the students, but to the teacher as well. For the teacher they will automatically know if a student is struggling and in what topic. 
1956	Thius could be very valuable to create a strong teacher studnent realtionship where the teacher is able to understant the smallest change in emotion to when they're confused or if they understamd it. This relationship could improving the learning environment and how comfortable a student with their students and peers. This technology could help teachers in both big and small schools. In big lecture halls, it may seem to be difficult for a professor to understand the emotions of all the students sitting before them, they might not even be able to see everyone because some may sit further away. With this new technology, teachers could be notified when some students become confused and then revisit a topic. Small classrooms could benifit greatly to this as well. Althought they are in a closer proximity then in lecture halls, they still will have the issue of not understanding the emotions which could lead to confusion. In smaller classrooms the teacher could know what they're doing wrong and be able to fix this easily without having to disturb the students. They can evaluate the emotions throughout the lesson and then later, they can change their lesson plans to adapt to the confusion of the students. This is again, a very valuable piece of technology that could help the teachers grow in their profession.  
1957	Initally one may think that this technology is redundant and that a teacher could just help the student, and that it may be invading the students privacy. 
1958	In reality, this technology continues to prove its many values, and it's evergrowing amount of benifits that completly overpower all the ideas that some may think its unnimportant. 
1959	This technology is valuable to both teachers and students equally. The teachers are able to improve their teaching techniques and the students understand more in school. This technology, however, is nowhere near done. This technology can be further improved in many aspects. I could keep improving and always creating a smarter version of the present day technology, that may one day, change the course of education forever. This could be implemented in the online schools to understand if a student comprehends the information the value of this is unspeakable and should be institued in classrooms globally.      
1960	schools should begin leaning more towards student designed summer assignments because of the immense freedom that is given and the responsibility that is required of students to create their own projects. It is important that from a young age, kids are able to write, discuss, and learn more about topics they are passionate about, and it is even more important that we do not limit their creativity because of the idea that projects should be teacher designed. 
1961	Image this, Your a person who doesn't really get out much, you don't talk to that many people, and you just generally keep to yourself. Now, think about this next question I'm going to ask you. If you were like that, would you be jumping out of your seat to do an extracurricular activity? If you were in this position, you would most likely say no. For some people, they need someone to help them take that step, and get out their and meet new people 
1962	It's for this reason why I think that all students should have to do at least one extracurricular activity, 
1963	"For example, look at this study that the Social Interaction and Communication Association took at a local middle school. When Students were pushed, or put out of their comfort zone to more things with others, they talked around 30% more than they use to, and had 45% easier time making friends with others. This shows that pushing these kids to talk to others more, or easing them out of their comfort zone, can really help them find people they can depend on. Showing that doing something like this can really be good for them. There isn't just that, there is also more evidence that proves this point! Generic_Name, A Counselor at Generic_School, Had this to say about pushing kids to do activities to meet new people ""There is usually a reason kids can be like this, it's because they haven't found the group of people that understand them, when pushed though, they can find those people, and feel like they belong,"". This shows that, from what Generic_Name observed, the students can find their people if they have someone help them try something new, and that they just need that little push to find them. "
1964	My next reason is that it could help you find talents and interests you wouldn't have found out by yourself. 
1965	"For Example, Here is what Justin Green, Author of fantasy books, had to say when asked about how he learned he liked to write, ""Honestly, I first learned about my love of writing when I joined a writing club as a teenager, without that club, I may have never learned about my passion,"". This shows that, even adults learned from taking that step, and learned about hobbies that they would have never known about otherwise! Another Example I have is a study made by The West Virginia Sports Association. They asked multiple college sports teams about when and how they gained the interest for the sport. A total of 50% of them said they learned about it through being pushed to take that step, and going out of their comfort zone. This means that, it's not just writing and more smaller hobbies, but sports like soccer and football as well. Showing that even famous people may have been pushed to take the step, and find their passion. "
1966	My final reason is that it can build confidence and team building skills! 
1967	"Going out of your comfort zone can really help you feel better about yourself, and not just keeping to yourself. Some Evidence for this is that, in a study taken by the Social Interaction and Communication Association, 60% of students that keep to themselves have lower than average self esteem. This would make sense seeing how if they always keep to themselves, they don't really have anyone to comfort them in their darker times, which this rule could help prevent. More Evidence that highlights this point is when Zachary Andrews, A College student from Colombia, had this to say, ""I honestly never really talked to that many people when I was younger, I didn't really like myself, and didn't think I deserved friends, but when my parents made me join the basketball team, I met and found people that I got along with really well,"". This would show that their is still hope for people that have low self esteem, that just have to have help taking the big step. "
1968	A lot of people on the other side say rule goes against people's right to make a choice for themselves. The most common example they use for this is that, in a study made by Mental Psychology University, 40% of students with lower self esteem and social problems often stay in their shell, out of habit and anger of being forced to participate. 
1969	"While that may be true, we can't help the people that will break out of their shell if we just look at the minority. Gary Smith, A Professor of psychology claimed the following, ""while there may be others that refuse to participate, we can't eliminate the rule completely, doing so could lead to the students growing up with social problems, such as depression, or suicidal thoughts,"". Looking at this, it shows that we are still helping people break free, and really live their lives, the others may just need more help with meeting new people. Everyone can do it, it just might take more time for others. "
1970	 Overall, I feel that I have made many points and examples on why students should have to do at least one extracurricular activity. Such as it helping you make new friends, it can help them discover hobbies, it improving confidence and team building skills, and how we shouldn't focus on the minority when it comes to this rule. This rule can really help so many people that can't break out of their shells on their own, and really save them from a dark future without any support to help them through it 
1971	Every day millions of children come home on a bus instead of staying after school, and for many, there is a very good reason. It seems to make sense, having everyone take a extra curricular activity, but in reality it doesn't work. Every student has a reason to go, or not to go to an extra curricular activity and some reasons are not just because of preference. Not everyone has a lifestyle that allows them to stay after school or do a sport, many of the students won't have a way to get home. The school will not be able to provide enough buses for these students either. There isn't even enough room in the current activity rooms to hold 78 kids, and the materials needed are to expensive. 
1972	Having mandatory extra curricular activities will be a disaster 
1973	it is to expensive 
1974	students won't be able to get home. 
1975	If our school system made extra curricular activities mandatory the first problem would be the amount of space needed to support the students activity. 
1976	For example, there are almost 900 students in my school, This would mean in the 10 after school activities my school provides, there would need to be 90 kids in each one; That's enough to fill 4 classrooms. This brings up another problem, the school can't have 150 kids in one program and 10 in the other, so the school would have to chose the activity for us. Just that fact alone takes all the excitement out of the activity, just for reference, imagine the star quarter back on the football ending up in art instead, possibly destroying his or her whole football career. Most of my school's after school activities need certain spaces for the participants to practice and do their activity. For instance the robotics team only has one room with all of the vices, saws, and tools while the other robotics rooms will have students constantly running between the other rooms getting tools that they dont have in their completely different room. The cheer leading team will have to move to the gym to fit all the people, but so did the pep band, and basketball practice is already in the gym, but they could just go in the auxiliary gym which is smaller than the cafeteria, the problem with that is the wrestling team is already in the auxiliary gym. The school has no room to fit every team and all of the clubs. 
1977	A dungeons and Dragons game along with all of the books and die is over 200 dollars, now imagining multiplying that by 7 just to afford the basics for the club. The robotics team pays around 600 dollars for each robot, and more for the competitions, now that program has to buy 15 robots and buy more slots at the competitions. If some how the schools were able to afford these expensive along with all other clubs, teachers, and staff salaries it would come from our local taxes. This would double our local taxes, but if the schools decide not to over tax the citizens of Generic_School than there would be no way the school could provide the gear and equipment for the school's clubs and teams. My school's sports gear is already worn out and our schools are in dire need of new equipment, but there is no way we could spend 7 times as much just to give everyone more cheap and basic equipment. 
1978	On most days my dad gets home at around six so when my activity ends at 4:30 in the afternoon i have to take the bus. Currently my school has 2 activity buses, one for Generic_City and one for Generic_City. The activity bus arrives at my home which is 5 miles away at 5:40 in the evening, it takes the bus 1 hour and 10 minutes to drop me off at my home. With a direct route the bus would have to travel at 4 mph. There is no way the school can hire enough buses to work almost 12 straight hours a day. If the school really can't find enough buses each bus would have to make 70 stops. Many students won't be able to be picked up by their parents and will be forced to endure the 3 hour bus ride through a city with only 30 square miles of residential area.  
1979	If our schools really made after school activities mandatory, it would be a disaster. One of the biggest issues with this topic is that in its simple form it looks like a great idea, but when you look at the details and what it would cause it shows the big mistake it would be. Giving every student the chance to do an interactive activity they enjoy would be incredible. Sadly, doing that in our current school system would cause all after school activities to stop going to competitions due to the over crowding; The students would not be able to pick their own activity and would be forced to do something they are bad at or just dislike. Making the activities would not only be a punishment to the students of Generic_School but to the teachers, the bus drivers, the custodians, the administrators, the taxpayers, and even our entire county's well being. In this scenario it may at first look like everybody wins, but really when you look at the real facts everybody loses. The entire mentality of school will become even more negative as students are stripped of their choice to do something they enjoy and taken away from time with their family. 
1980	Although the goal of this rule would be to create a good learning environment and a chance to participate in more interactive learning experiences, 
1981	It is said that, over summer break students tend to forget the majority of what they learned during the school year. Once the year begins, their teachers advise them to use the information given from the classes taken prior to assist them. It should be out of the question, that students need to do school work during their 2 month-long summer vacation. The question at hand is, who should be in charge of creating these summer assignments, the teachers or the students? 
1982	Firstly, a teacher has a certain credibility that students do not 
1983	The goal of these assignments is to help the students fortify their knowledge over summer so that it is not lost. These teachers go through years of university studying the subject that they teach, so why should a student who has taken the class for one year have authority over summer assignments. For example, AP BC Calculus is an immense subject with a variety of different units of math. If a student tried to make a summer study guide, they would only have a year of experience under their belt. On the other hand, teachers, who have been teaching/studying this subject for years, have a strong understanding of each unit and how to teach it in a unique way. The credibility of the creator of the assignment must be strong, so the student can have an easier time understanding the subject. Thus, teachers should be assigning summer assignments. 
1984	Following my previous statement, teachers who have been working with students for years know the best strategies for getting students to absorb the subject. 
1985	Many students have a hard time grasping a topic. If students decide to ask a colleague before a teacher, they have the chance of getting incorrect information or no help at all. For example, many students in the AP Computer Science course have to figure out problems of which have many different solution. Students who don't want to give away their specific answer will try to help students figure out a secondary solution. Unfortunately, most students will not be able to figure out a second solution, because they don't have enough experience. Once the student asks the teacher for help, the teacher will be able to help the student find a solution because of their expertise. Therefore, teachers can offer a more valuable source of knowledge that will stick with the student. 
1986	Although the student designing the assignment knows how other students' brain works, they don't have the experience that teachers have. Students designing assignments don't know exactly how to get through to students who do not know how to do the work 
1987	. On the other hand, Teachers who have been working with students for years will know how to get a student to grasp the topics. Therefore, teachers designing assignments will know how to mold the assignment into a more enjoyable experience.  
1988	the efforts that teachers put into their own education provides strong evidence that teachers should be creating and assigning summer assignments. The years teachers spend in school give them the required credibility that is nessasary for students to trust teachers' judgement. Also, the effort teachers put into their work, to make sure their students are able to understand the topic, comes from their experience as teachers. Use these points to figure out that teacher-designed assignments are more beneficial than student-based assignments. 
1989	you get to travel around and visit a lot of countries but also you get to help out countries that aren't at there finest at the moment. 
1990	Imagine sitting on your fluffy, brown couch, thinking of what you could do if you signed up for the drama club, band, or even strings. You look at all your friends posts about how fun yearbook club was when you weren't even there. How would you feel? After school activities can do a lot for you. I've always enjoyed them even though it's extra hours at school. 
1991	In my opinion, you should choose at least one extracurricular activity to do after school. 
1992	After school activities will prevent laziness, 
1993	bring happiness into going to school, 
1994	it may even help you become more social.  
1995	"When you actually have something to do after school, you are out running about, having fun, and you aren't even thinking about sitting on your phone, eating all the chocolate covered pretzels in the world. Knowing myself, all I want to do when I get home is eat, and of course, sleep. Being lazy leads to weight gain. Many students my age care about how they look to others. You have to be ""skinny"" to ""fit in"" or ""thick"" for boys to like you. It's always good to stay in shape and after school activities may help you with that. Doing what you love makes you more energized. Most clubs have fundraisers you can volunteer for and contribute too. You can stay up at night planning about it, making up cool ideas that'll keep you awake. Overall, no student should just sit at home, doing nothing but eating, if they have a choice to join a club. "
1996	"When you might not have classes with a certain friend, it is always a good thing to see them if you have an after school activity with them. The friendship won't fade if you still get to talk to them for even just an hour a day. Sharing what you do after school makes you feel like you are apart of something. I always like sharing my stories about my track meets, practices, and pretty much everything. It's exciting to share stories to your friends instead of saying, ""oh, I don't do anything after school."" You should be happy about seeing the process you made for the school environment. If you end up in the gardening club or even a Junior Honors Society type club, you help make the front of your schools plants look pretty. People will most likely compliment you daily about how it looks and it'll make you very happy. Don't you want people complimenting your work? Lastly, not being in clubs wont make you happy going to school because you have nothing to look forward too. You could've chose between 100 or more clubs to join, but you didn't so you regret it. "
1997	A frantic middle schooler had just received a load of homework from all of her teachers. Packets upon worksheets upon study guides that all needed to be done tonight. If she had to stay after school there would be no time for chores that needed to be done and the homework. Children and parents have the right to choose if they would want to do after school. Not all parents and students would agree with having after school mandatory. Is having a madatory after school really benificial. 
1998	Students should be able to choose if they want to do after school. Some students have a lot of homework already that the teachers give out, so most students are spending a sunny day inside doing homework after a long day at school and a long after school activity. Many students have stress and are overwhelmed by having too much homework and after school right after that. Most students have enough work that had to be done during school. Why push it so they have to stay longer and do more work than they should. Adding after school to the schedule will make more busy parents frustrated because they are the ones who have to pick up their child. The after school schedules does not meet up with the parents schedule and it make everything chaotic and difficult. 
1999	Teachers had a long day of having to put up with back talk and misbehaving kids at school. They just want to go home and relax with their family. Teachers also have duties at home just like kids, but they have to grade students work and enter it into a online system. If teachers have to put after school into their schedule many teachers would be really tired and exhausted from working before school until after school. Teacher have a life outside of school just like the kids that attend school do so, it really should be their choice if they want to do after school or not. Not just teachers but faculty and staff will have to do double the work and double the cleaning from after school. Students are not the only one that need a break. 
2000	I believe that the author did very well supporting his claim 
2001	"In Paragraph 4, the author states, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" If this is true, then could Venus become like Earth once again? "
2002	I believe the author is trying to say that Venus is worth exploring to see if it is able to be like Earth once more 
2003	"In Paragraph 6, the author suggests, ""Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough misson to understand Venus would need to get up close and person despite the risks. Or maybe we should think of them as challenges."" I believe the author is correct in this statement "
2004	. If we start looking at exploring Venus as a challenge instead of a risk, it could possibly give researchers more motivation to get out and explore. 
2005	"In Paragraph 8, the author claims, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiousity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."" The author brought up the word ""challenge"" again, "
2006	he really thinks the challenge is worth it. 
2007	I agree with him in this claim because if humans can explore Venus, I also believe we can go on to do bigger and better things with exploring our solar system 
2008	The author did a good job in making his claims and then proceeding to back them up with evidence and facts. Although he had some opinions, the article was overall well written and well put together. The author convinced me, as the reader, that exploring Venus is definitely worth a few more tries. 
2009	The use of technology improves people's daily lives, especially in school. With all the technology that we now have available, it is easier than ever to learn things, and with newer technology coming out it is only becoming easier. 
2010	The use of the Facial Action Coding System to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable 
2011	it helps educators 
2012	allows students to learn better, 
2013	keeps students engaged. 
2014	This technology could be very valuable and helpful for educators. 
2015	"Educators have a very important job. They are building the future for society, which can be very hard. Teachers have to deal with many students, and every student is different. With the use of the Facial Action Coding System, teachers don't have to worry about a teaching method that will not work with all students. In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto it says that the system recognizes if a student is confused, and alters the lesson to better fit the student. This allows educators to not worry about finding a teaching method that suites every student. This technology also helps out educators, because it works one on one with students. It's made to help every student individually by reading the student's facial expressions. As student's learning patterns may change, the system changes with the student. The use of this technology will also be helpful for teachers because educators can take a look and see what teaching methods work the best with students overall. In the article it says the system can detect when students are confused and bored, so educators can use this technology to see what doesn't make students feel confused nor bored. This technology could be very valuable and helpful for educators. "
2016	The Facial Action Coding system is valuable because it allows students to remain engaged. 
2017	"In the article,""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto, it describes how the system can regognize how a student is feeling. The lesson changes depending on how the system reads the student's reaction. The system can read when a student is bored and change up the lesson. This is essential because it allows students to be more engaged in learning, since it will no longer be as boring as it was for them. The system may also help students to remain engaged in learning because nobody would be learning something the same exact way. In the article it says that lessons are modified to fit every student using facial recognition, so students would be learning in a way that suites them personally. This technology also keeps students more engaged because they would feel happier, because the system tries to keep students engaged and happy. In the article it says that the system can ready when people are unhappy, so the system would try to prevent students from feeling that way about learning. The system could really help students be more excited about learning.  "
2018	Using the Facial Action Coding System to read the emtional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable because it allows students to learn better. 
2019	"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto it says that the system could ""modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"". All students would be able to get helped individually, one on one with the system. The system also allows students to learn better because everyone learns things differently, and the system would be able to adjust for every student's learning style. In the article it says that the system can detect if a student is confused, so the system would be very valuable in classrooms because it would make sure that students are not confused. The system would make sure that students are actuallly comprehending the material. "
2020	The Facial Action Coding system could be very valuable in classrooms. It has many benefits to both students and educators. It would allow students to remain engaged, learn better, and it would also help educators, A system like this could really allow all students to reach their full potential. 
2021	Many schools made the smart decision of requiring a summer project to make sure that their students are learning over a long break, as students who do not exercise their brain over the summer are known to have less knowledge when returning from the break. If schools started giving out the option of students being able to design these projects instead of the teachers, the beneficial aspects of the summer project would start to dissipate. 
2022	Thus, teachers should design the summer projects instead of students, as they know what the student would benefit from.  
2023	Thus, students should not be given the option to design their own summer project, as they will not learn as much as they should. 
2024	For twelfth grade and below, states give teachers a list of learning targets, based on their grade and subject(s), that they must cover over the course of the school year. The teachers are already familiar with those targets as they have spent years learning them. That is how teachers understand their subject and it is their job to help their students understand it over the course of the school year, which is why students are not excpected to teach themselves the learning targets for their coming classes over summer break. Thus, when teachers make the projects, they know how much of the syllabus and how many things from the last school year to incorporate. After completing the project designed by teachers, students will have the right amount of background knowledgeneeded to feel prepared for thecoming year 
2025	In conclusion, teachers should create the summer project as they know what to teach to the students in order to prepare them for the next school year. 
2026	A teacher's job is to teach a syllabus to their students over a given period of time. In order to do this, teachers must have a understanding in how much work to give to a student so that they would understand the concept and not feel overwhelmed doing so. In most cases, teachers have years of experience that help them understand the capabilities of student. In the other cases, the new teachers had to earn their college degree by knowing how much work a student can and should handle. Either way, teachers truly understand how much work to give to their students so that they can benefit from it 
2027	Thus, teachers should design the summer projects as they know how much work a student can handle 
2028	In conclusion, summer projects should be designed by teachers and not students. While some say that students should design the projects as they know what they can handle, teachers have a degree in knowing what a student can handle. Also, teachers know what to teach to the students to prepare them for the coming year, and most students will not push themselves hard enough while making the project. Thus, teachers should design the summer projects as they truly know what the student would benefit from. 
2029	NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft has found something while circling  Mars. But what is it, they have seem to have found a face formed into the rocks. Is this new discovery actually a face or is it just another rock formation.  The believers and the non-believers of the face on Mars are waiting anxiously to find out what it is. Is it a rock formation or is it an actual human face, no one knows 
2030	Around the American West there are common landforms know as butte or mesa and they are actually equivalent to the Martian. 
2031	The world today contains numerous conspiracy theories. One of these conspiracies is about the mysterious face on Mars. Some conspiracy theorists state that the face on Mars is actually a result of Alien life. 
2032	However NASA has provided evidence that proves the face on Mars is actually just a natural landform. 
2033	Through advancements in digital imagery, 
2034	an understanding of shadows, 
2035	an understanding that there is no alien life evidence, 
2036	"When the face on Mars was originally captured, there was no such thing. The article explains that when the picture was originally captured in 1976, the camera quality was not great. For example the text states, ""Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" So, when given a better camera quality than in 1976, the face on mars no longer looks like a defined face. Although the quality of the camera is a great support, there are many other explanations that put an end to conspiracy theorists. "
2037	"Some of the biggest tricks played are constructed by the eyes. When the first image of the face on Mars was revealed, the features such as the eyes and nose were most likely created by shadows. In the article it explains, ""A few days later NASA unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a 'huge rock formation...which resembles a human head...formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."" "
2038	the only reason the natural landform even remotely looked like a face was because of shadows. 
2039	"With all of the technology used to investigate the red planet, proof of alien life should have already been found. Jim Garvin, chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program explained, ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size...So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" By stating this, Garvin is saying that if there was any evidence of aliens builing this face on Mars, it would have been found. "
2040	Those who believe in aliens building the face on Mars might srgue that NASA is secretly holding evidence that there theories are correct. 
2041	However, NASA has nothing to gain from hiding information from the world. If anything, NASA would want the world to know about ancient aliens building landforms. 
2042	"The article mentions, ""Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an acient civilization on Mars."" This statement proves that NASA has no reason to hide information. "
2043	So, while some conspiracy theorists would like to think that aliens created this well-known face on Mars, they are incorrect. The face on Mars is just a natural landform that was wrongly perceived by the public. By advancing in digital technology, understanding the effect of shadows, and realizing that there is no evidence to support aliens on Mars, it can be concluded that the face on Mars is just another peculiar natural landform. 
2044	Summer projects are often seen by the student populous as a scourge upon their lives, more work to procrastinate on. To teachers, however, they are a tool which students can use in order to stay on track with their education and keep up-to-date information with. As painful as they seem, these projects are created with a significant goal in mind: teaching accurately and consistently. 
2045	teacher-designed summer curricula enable the student to learn and apply their knowledge suited to the general teaching style. 
2046	"Over the summer, it's difficult for many students to stay on track with their learning, and it's very easy for them to drift away from their usual learning. Staying on-track is essential for students with good expectations and high goals; these projects can be designed to accomplish this, without any rough beginnings once the semester starts. In calculus, my teacher has very high expectations for his students. Every one of us received a ""summertime fun packet"" to work through over the summer, and it prepped us for the year that was to come: the first day of school, he jumped right into action and lectured to us as if it were the day before the AP exam. Because of his summer assignment's intuitive design, most students were prepared for this behavior, and could take thorough notes on the subject, further proving that teacher-designed projects are more useful to the hardworking student. "
2047	they are tailored to the unique curriculum the student will be taught with. 
2048	"Any good teacher can deviate from the standard curriculum throughout their teaching, and an assignment on par with the syllabus prepares the student for this ""improvisation."" For instance, my literature teacher assigned us questions analyzing a book we had read in the year, preparing our brains for the material we would be seeing in the year. Although the curriculum calls for practice in rhetorical analysis, it does not discuss proper thesis writing: our instructor assigned us work for both of these. Every dedicated student in the class was not only prepared for the work we were given, but we were confident in our abilities to accomplish these assignments. On account of the deep analysis questions my teacher assigned to me over the summer, I was more able to excel in my work in language and literature, further driving me to learn more and become more accomplished in my English classes. "
2049	better for the student because a teacher has considerably more years of experience both learning and teaching effectively. 
2050	Generic_Name taught us to hold mutual respect between student and teacher; in the best of classes, this respect is still exercised and encouraged to make learning as enriching and impactful as possible. With this in mind, the teacher is also more likely to be accurately designing their projects to reasonable expectations for the student, and to make summer assignments as practical as possible. Teachers are constantly informed on new teaching strategies and the most effective ways for students to apply themselves, and it's their job to make use of this in order to prepare their students for their futures. Alongside personal experience and intuitive training, the teacher is in a much less biased position to be creating work, without personal incentives to lighten the workload or to cut corners in their answers. All things considered, the experience a teacher has in preparing students for class is the most valuable quality they hold when it comes to your workload, far outweighing the experience of a busy student. 
2051	When I was in 9th and 10th grade, I had to do summer projects all the time. Even though I didn't want to do them, they helped me for the next year so my brain stayed fresh. However, doing it under the teachers rule felt like working in a factory, and it also felt like we weren't learning as much as we were just doing the project. 
2052	it helps with the student's creativity level, 
2053	puts less stress on the teachers, 
2054	allows the student to learn the best way possible. 
2055	When you learn, it's best to learn in a way that is fun and enjoyable to do. Student designed summer projects would help the student's creativity level 
2056	Another reason students should design their own projects is because it could put less stress on the teachers who assigned it 
2057	With all the work the kids are doing, and since some teachers are putting in more time to grade and organize summer assignments, they'll be able to let the students work and all they ave to do is grade the work. I always talk to my teachers on a personal level, and a lot of them say that making/coming up with projects are one of the hardest things to do as a teacher when you have other things on your plate. So students making their own projects would help with that stress which means that they can put more time into grading your project precisely. 
2058	Lastly, another way student designed projects are a better choice than teacher designed projects is because they allow the student to learn the best way possible 
2059	"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" tries to explain the several complications of sending a mission to Venus. They provide tons of factual evidence about the geography and climate of Venus. "
2060	They give many good points, but ultimately fail at their task to convince readers that Venus exploration is worth it. Along with a failed point, this author tends to go off on side-tangents that have minimal importance to the story. 
2061	"The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" is an article about the positives and negatives of trying to land a spacecraft on Venus. He has a decent build-up into his first point while giving more and more small facts about our second planet. "
2062	They write about NASA wanting to know as much as possible about one of our closest neighbors, but don't give enough reasons as to why it's worth it. With acidic atmospheres ripping through machinery, technologies don't stand a chance on the Venusian surface. With the science that we have, the most we can hope for is a jet-like expirience, flying several miles above surface so that the pressure doesn't crush us instantly. Venus is additionally prone to constant volcanoes, earthquakes, and storms deadly enough to take out machinery. Given all this information, it seems like the author is trying to deter us from missions to Venus instead of promoting it, as they planned. 
2063	"Multiple times, the author delves into a side-topic as opposed to continuing on with the topic of Venus exploration. They start off the article with two sentences that have no relation to the story, yet confuse readers. The sentences are about Venus' nickname, the ""Evening Star"", and how even though it is a planet, it is still called this. This is completely irrelevant to exploration, as everyone knows it is a planet, and the ""Evening Star"" name is never mentioned again. Later on in the passage, the author rambles on about World War II-age computers and how they functioned properly even before the digital age. Once more, this is slightly irrelevant and does not contribute to the story at all except to add another paragraph instead of focusing on the specifics of how NASA is using them to help with Venus. "
2064	"Overall, this article about Venus is less than ""stellar"". The author attempts to prove why Venus missions are a neccesity, but doesn't quite get their point across. They provide great knowledge and information, despite being off-topic occasionally. This article is full of great facts, but the delivery is off and could have potentially been a better read if the author was on the other side of the argument, which has more proof to back it up. All in all, the author does not support their idea the best. "
2065	it promotes alternative forms of transportation 
2066	it also reduces air pollution. 
2067	"In the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", by Elisabeth Rosenthal, the author talks about a car-free town, Vauban, Germany. Because there are not cars, people are forced to use other forms of transportation. Instead of using cars, mothers and their children walk everywhere, people ride their bikes to the store, and a tram is used to go to downtown Freiburg. Another place where transportation has benefited from a car-free society, is Bogota, Columbia. According to the article ""Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota"", written by Andrew Selsky, since car-free day began, bicycle and pedestrian-friendly areas have been improved. For example, since the 1990s, 118 miles of bicycle paths have been built in Bogota. ""Parks and sports centers have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up"", writes Selsky. Promotion of other transportation, such as walking, is just one of many benefits of limiting car usage. "
2068	"""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"", Rosenthal writes in ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"". By driving less, we can reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. ""Paris bans driving due to smog,"" by Robert Duffer, is a prime example of the reduction of air pollution after limiting car usage. ""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city"", writes Duffer. One Friday, the smog of Paris ""rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world"". On the following Monday, motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a $31 fine. After only one day with less cars on the roads, the smog had nearly dissappeared. This shows that even a day with less cars can make a huge difference in the amount of air pollution. Rosenthal's article, "" The End of Car Culture"", states that many sociologists believe that if the pattern of less cars continues, ""it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment"" because transortation is America's second largest sourse of carbon emissions. Less air polution is a very important advantage of less cars.  "
2069	there are many advantages of limiting the use of cars. Not only does it promote and improve other forms of transportation, but it also decreases the amount of smog and air pollution, which are harming our environment.  
2070	If the Summer is plagued with more work we should be the ones to design it, so we can still be an creative and a hardworking student, have a strong understanding of the subject and voice out pressing matters in the world.  While us students want to be done with school and be free, it is scientifically proven that if you don't continue learning a subject you'll forget about the subject you're learning. To keep that retention 
2071	to keep you the students in check; It can vary from a research project to an presentation using key objectives in class to show how you used them in the real world. The position everyone should say is, yes to further have higher Graduation rates and Test scores, because if the students show compassion to their school work & their will to get things done, every one will succeed. When we work together, build each other up and help each other when needed the world becomes a whole lot brighter, nobody should have to be bogged down in a project that seems like it was made to have you suffer. This project should be fun and should make you want to complete it to show your classmates how well you did; It should also prove that you care for your work and backs it up . 
2072	Imagine being convinced that completing a certain task is worth any strugles along the way, and you end up severely hurt because of it. That is exaclty what the author of this article is trying to do. 
2073	"In the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author does a poor job of supporting the idea that studying a planet as dangerous as Venus is worth it. "
2074	Studying Venus is a terrible idea because technology isn't advanced enough 
2075	it would take years to discover anything beneficial 
2076	the costs' of this, both in money and lives, are outrageous.  
2077	Technology throughout the world has improved since the 1900's,however, it has improved on Earth and in regards to Earthly tasks. 
2078	"When talking about something as dangerous as exploring another planet, it is easy to see that our Earth bound technology simply cannot do the job. in paragraph 5 of the article, the author describes an idea that was thought up by ""The National Aeronautics and Space Administartion"". This idea is to have humans 30 or so miles above Venus for exploration. The author claims how this would be beneficial in keeping humans safe from the Venusian landscape. However, The author does not support this idea well, as he goes on to say how not much exploration can be done from there, and the conditions would still be extremely dangerous but ""survivable"". Also in paragraph 7, the author explains how NASA is working on other approaches to study Venus. He explains how they are working on some simplified electronics, made of silicon carbide, that have been testedd in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface. This may sound like a good thing, but it is far from one. This is because the author finsihes by saying that the electronics lasted only three weeks. If a computer can't withstand Venus's conditions longer than three weeks, I am very doubtful that a human can. This proves my point that our technology is far too inadvanced for such a task like exploring another planet. Therefore supporting my claim that the author did a poor job in supporting this idea. "
2079	Exploring unmarked territory isn't something that can be done over night. Unmarked territory is exactly what Venus is. Even if technology did evolve enough so that humans could visit this planet, it would takes years, decades, even centuries, to accomplish 
2080	"In the article, the author continously offers alternatives for exploration. He does this is paragraphs' 5,6, and 7 where he gives examples of organizations that are working towards this exploration. However in all of the paragraphs, the author seems to only be giving ""what if"" scenarios or in some cases just simple ideas that have been thought about and are possibly being examined. He fails to provide any real data or statistics for these things, except when he mentions the simplified electronics in paragraph 7. Even then, those devices are only able to survive for 3 weeks, so it would still take many years to just improve those devices. Also, in paragraph 6 the author states, ""Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus"". This statement is very broad, and it does not key in on any form of information that should lead us to believe that to be true. These details from the passage prove my point on the amount of years it would take, as well as the fact that nobody has any idea how long. The question to be asked here is, ""Is it worth the wait?"". For these reaons I stand behind my claim that the author supported the idea of exploring venus very poorly.  "
2081	Assuming that the exploration of Venus does eventually happen one day, how much money would go into it, how many lives? 
2082	"These are all questions that need to be considered when brainstoming the idea of visitng another planet. The author of this article is avoiding all of these mainstream problems by simply saying it's worth the risks, when it actaully is not. In paragraph 3, the author explains all of the dangers of Venus and how they can affect humans. He explains, "" On the planet's surface, the temperature averages over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" Considering that this is true, we can definitrly assume that condition on Venus are severly dangerous, and a lot of people may get hurt trying to explore it. The aurthor also states, "" These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oeans and would liquefy many metals. What the author is stating here is that not even our strongest materials and creations can withstand the conditions on Venus. This means that in order to explore Venus we have to design all new machinery, which would cost a lot of money, not to mention the human costs as we would need humans to test things out. He also makes it notable that venus has the hottest surface of any planet, despite not being the closest to the sun. All of these facts are serious concerns when regarding human safety as well as propr functioning of machines. Even if exploring Venus was a possibilty, would it be even be worth it after all of he human costs and money costs or paid. What we are discussing here is putting human lives at risk, and spending a ton of money on a project that is no where near being ready ready to present. These reasons as well as the provided facts assure me on my claim that the author did a terrible job of supporting this idea of exploration. "
2083	In conclusion, since our technology isn't advanced enough, it would take far too many years to do, and the human and money costs wuold be outrageously high, we should not explore Venus. Exploring Venus proves to be very dangerous, and we have proved that we are no where near being ready for such a task. We would first need to advance our technology for the task. This would take years to due, it would also use up a ton of money, and put people in serious danger. The author did a terrible job of supporting the idea that exploring Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dnagers it presents. For one, there were not enough facts presented in the article that were beneficiary to the idea. Also, of the pros that were present, the cons outweighed then tremendously. Exploring Venus proves to be a terrible idea, atleast until we are actually ready to do it.      
2084	it helps students retain forgotten information, 
2085	allows students to prepare for the upcoming school year, 
2086	it keeps students busy throughout the summer. 
2087	Summer projects should be student-designed because it allows students to retain forgotten information from the previous school year. 
2088	Subjects including math or science require concepts to be retained because they build off of each other. For example, it is required for students to remember Algebra 1 to succeed in Algebra 2. This sets up students for success so they are not lost when they enter the school year. Going along with that, teachers don't always have enough time in the year to go over forgotten concepts. A lot of school subjects go at a fast pace and have a lot of content to go over. This doesn't allow teachers to go over concepts from prior years. Making school projects student-designed will set up students for success because they have that prior knowledge to build off. When students retain information from the previous year, it gives them confidence when tackling new concepts. Schools try their best to give students confidence so they can perform to the best of their abilities. Their confidence can be damaged when they don't remember concepts from the previous year which goes into learning new subjects. This hinders their ability to succeed in school. Making summer projects student-designed will help them remember past concepts, which will increase student confidence during the school year. 
2089	Going along with that, making summer projects student-designed will give them an idea about the skills they need to know for the next school year. 
2090	Before students enter a class, they may feel anxious about the difficulty of the class. Students may not necessarily know what a specific class is expecting from them. Making summer projects student-designed will give students an idea about the expectations of a particular class. This will reduce the anxiety faced by students because they already have an idea about the kind of work assigned in that class. Students will also get a head start on concepts learned for the next school year. When students enter school, they won't be confused when they start to learn because they already had practice on these concepts on the summer project. This makes academics much easier for students and allows them to have an understand even before the upcoming school year. Furthermore, if students are prepared for concepts learned for the next school year, it will remove the negative connotation that students have with school. Students often don't like school because it is challenging or they do not understand what is being taught. If schools assigned a summer project to students, it will help students think positively about school. This will allow students to enjoy the subject they are learning because they will not be lost trying to grasp the new concepts. 
2091	Allowing summer projects to be student-designed will keep students busy throughout the summer. 
2092	Students often face laziness and boredom throughout the summer because they have no work to do. Making summer projects student-designed will prevent students from laziness and actually give them something to do. Keeping students busy during the summer will give them a better transition into the school year. Often, students are not prepared to work again due to having three months off. This makes the transition into school difficult for students because they are used to having that time off. If school projects were student-based, students would have an easier transition into school because they would already be used to working during the summer. Keeping students busy during the summer will benefit their work habits when entering the school year. Furthermore, keeping students busy with summer projects will keep their brains working. It is important that students brains are still active throughout the summer so they can be mentally prepared for the next school year. It is important for students to stay busy throughout the summer so skills such a problem solving aren't lost. Skills such as problem solving are important for student because it not only helps them in school, but in their personal lives as well. Students need to get used to staying busy in the summer because it will prepare them for a real world job. Students need to keep their brains engaged, which is why making summer projects student-based will keep them physically and mentally active. 
2093	Remembering information from previous school years, learning concepts for the upcoming school year, and keeping students busy are all valid arguments as to why summer projects should be student-designed. Making school projects teacher-designed will not benefit students in any way because they will not have the experience necessary to succeed in the upcoming school year. 
2094	Teachers are already trained on how to teach so it would be unnecessary for them to be teacher-based. 
2095	Going along with that, students need to realize that summer projects are not a punishment. 
2096	Although there may be many conflicting dangers and concerns with space travel, it is possible. As the author said, we should not let doubt stop us from discovering a great planet. We can come up with the technology to some day visit this planet. With the correct technology anything can be possible. 
2097	Students should have the projects be teacher-designed because if students designed the projects they would be easier than if the teachers designed them. 
2098	the teachers would have to make the project a big part of their grade because there would be a lot of students who wouldnt do the project. 
2099	are put in play for higher level classes for the purpose to prepare students for what is to come in the following year, 
2100	to help them get a good start in grades and knowledge.  
2101	Teachers in these higher level classes spend a lot of time teaching material to students and never have enough days in the year to teach it all without cramming it down the throats of their pupils, thus creating the need for the summer assignment 
2102	In Advanced Placement classes, teachers want to make sure that students are learning the right material and the right amount of it too, which is why it is much more teacher created and designed then student. In Advanced Placement Language and Composition, the summer assignment consisted of specific instructions to find fifteen different sources for certain topics and write short precis on each one; however, the students were able to choose what sources they used as long as they followed the guidelines. This gave the student a little bit of freedom to choose, while the assignment was still teacher designed. This method was extremely beneficial to the following year once enrolled in the class due to the type of work students were doing right off the bat. Throughout the year, teachers create class work every day for their students to help them on their way to a good grade in the class and a better understanding of the material. No one argues that students should make class work, that wouldn't be practical for the class since they are the ones learning the information. Shouldn't the same be said for the summer assignment due to it being the very first assignment of the year before the class even started? 
2103	When teachers let students create their own work, it can become more of a hurting situation rather than a helping situation. 
2104	There are many different types of students in classroom settings, but a trait most have in common is the apathy to do homework, projects, or class work. Asking a student to complete an assignment over their three month break over the summer is difficult enough; therefore, asking them to design the project themselves and execute it? There is no way they will be prepared to come back to school and preform well in the class. Teachers themselves know the most about the subject they teach, the students take the class to learn said subject from the teacher because they don't know it yet. How could teachers expect students to create an effective summer assignment on a subject they don't know anything about yet? 
2105	In some respects, student designed projects can be beneficial. 
2106	Most students possess the resentment of work in general assigned by a teacher; however, maybe if the students were to create the summer assignments themselves, put their own spin on it and make it their own to help them learn the lesson better, it could be beneficial to the teachers having that load off of them for the year to start. Students love freedom, they love to be able to do what they want and control their lives and school work, if they are given the freedom to create their own summer assignment then quite possibly, the outcome might be much more creative and interesting. 
2107	Yes this could work, giving the students freedom, but it also has been done before and the effect has been, contrary to popular belief, less then stellar. 
2108	In Pre-Advanced Placement World History, students were required to plan, create, and execute an entire project based off of a topic of their choice relating to world history and present it to the class. It was expected that students would create said project at an Advanced Placement level skill set, that did not go as planned. Students would come into class during work days and do absolutely nothing, treating the block like a study hall, and when it came time to present projects, they had next to nothing, or something that could be done by a sixth grader. Students did not take the assignment seriously and could not be trusted to create projects or assignments on their own. When asked why the poor outcome of the project, students protested with arguments of how it was their assignment to design and how it was unfair of teachers to judge them on their skill set for that even though the real reason was them slacking off to still get a grade; therefore, it is out of question whether or not students should be able to create assignments for themselves, let alone be trusted with the task. 
2109	Ever since school has been in session it has been the same way, the teachers create the work and teach, and the students work and learn. Why would we change that now? Students have proven to be untrustworthy in creating their own work on numerous occasions and should not be designing work for subjects they haven't even learned yet. The summer assignments were created for teachers to get students a head start on the upcoming year for the advanced class that they were taking, it is supposed to prepare them for what is to come. The students have not learned this material, the teachers have, lets leave the assignment designing to the ones who know what they are talking about and know how the course is going to go, and the learning up to the students.  
2110	Generic_Name sighed while he got on his bus on the last day of middle school, and was pretty bummed that he realized he didn't join any clubs or sports during his time at school. Even though his friends recommended that he should, he didn't really want to do it. All of his friends that joined activities made cool, new friends in the clubs they were in, and became more active when they participated in sports. He was upset that he didn't do any of those things in middle school, but decided that he would give it a chance when he went to high school. When he got home, Generic_Name thought about the kinds of clubs he wanted to join, and different sports he wanted to participate in, and was looking forward to it.  
2111	Students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity during school 
2112	it can help you make new friends 
2113	help you become more fit/ stay active depending on the activity 
2114	If you join any sports or clubs, you are definitely going to meet new people to make your friends, which is a great thing because it gives you people to talk to and get along with so you won't be by yourself in any activities you would do after school. 
2115	However, some people don't like joining clubs because they could be antisocial or can be nervous and have trouble meeting new people 
2116	but it's okay, it takes time to get used to people you dont know, so joining clubs and making new friends can help you be more social and find it easier to get along with others. 
2117	Joining sports/ physical clubs can help you stay in shape and stay healthy 
2118	most sports will most likely have you break a sweat, and a lot of sports include running and jumping, and require some strength. Volleyball, wrestling, football, basketball, hockey, soccer, etc, keep you active and healthy because your exercising by doing sports which is good for your body, but you have to keep in mind not to overwork yourself because it can become tiring and maybe a little dangerous if you work for too long without taking any breaks. Sports can definitely become rough and you can really get hurt if your not careful, so it's important to get enough sleep, eat right, and stay hydrated before playing so you don't risk getting injured. 
2119	Being in most clubs can help to improve skills on different things such as art, cooking or baking, acting, writing, sewing, and things like that 
2120	Some things that are provided in different clubs can really come in handy at some point in your future. 
2121	Learning new things or improving your skills can impress your friends and family, and can sometimes earn you money. For example, if you improve in art or sewing, you would be able to sell it for a bit of money depending on how skilled you are, maybe $20-$30, or if you're good at cooking/ baking, you could sell it at a bake sale or maybe just give it to your friends or family to enjoy as a treat. Learning new things and improving skills can be fun, but sometimes it can take time and effort to put into learning new things and improving, so you have to be willing to take time into that and do your best because it's worth it in the end. 
2122	Generic_Name smiled as he got on his bus on the last day of middle school, as he sat down in his seat with the friends he made during the year through after school activities, they remembered and talked about all the cool sports and clubs they did during their time throughout middle school. They remembered the clubs they joined such as facs club and art club, and how their skills on baking and drawing improved, they also talked about the sports like soccer and basketball they all participated in together, and Generic_Name can definitely say that he's gotten healthier since he joined. When he got home, he thought about trying out for the basketball team again during high school and was really looking forward to it. 
2123	In today's world students are proving to be more disobedient and disrespectful. 
2124	Teacher designed projects teach students to be independent and self relying, but they also teach them to research and learn and that some things aren't always specifically based on their preferences. 
2125	"A current event example that directly correlates to this problem is the phrase ""boomer."" This word is directed towards the Baby Boomer Generation and is used to describe the independent and self relying seniors who dont agree with the way the schooling system is operated. This generation lived in a time where authority was the key figure across the nation and it was not to be disrespected or major consequences would occur. "
2126	A major system that has changed along the years is the schooling system and a major factor in this change is teachers allowing more student based projects, instead of teacher based projects. 
2127	This is a major turn for the worse because students are taking advantage of this and aren't learning anything new for themselves, which is creating more volatile and unintelligent individuals. A historical example that relates more to the way the schooling was before this was the Brown v. Board of Education case. Although, this was a terrible time of segregated schools it was the Brown family who took independence when no one would stand with them and they took the fight to the Supreme Court for their well deserved equality and civil right. However, it would be another grueling, sad 20 years until this was accomplished it can be believed that the way the curriculum was taught related to the way this family was courageous enough to complete this task. 
2128	teacher based projects are more informational and they give students the chance to learn something new. 
2129	A direct example of this would be when I was issued a student designed project my tenth grade summer and at first I found it interesting until I received a hundred percent on it. This made me realize that I wasn't learning anything by doing this student based project and that it was more important to create something more challenging and less suited for my taste. I thank my teacher for this opportunity to learn about the major differences in teacher and student based projects and for the chance to learn more efficiently. 
2130	Teacher based projects prove to be superior according to many people. They are also a better learning tool and they create a more efficient learning environment for students. Without these projects students would be less obedient and wouldn't show as much respect to their authoritative figures. These projects are able to play a major factor in the curriculum taught by the schooling systems. And they are important to the growth of young individuals.  
2131	A student presents their self-designed science project: it is a box of dry ice and a research paper on the properties of the peculiar substance. The project has a valid topic, but it is almost irrelevant to the curriculum of the class. A month later, the student realizes that the summer project should have been some sort of a review of the graphing unit last year---which they had forgotten completely. A summer project is meant to preserve the necessary knowledge from the year before and to prepare the student for the upcoming year. If the project's design includes and practices irrelevant information, then its purpose is completely undermined. 
2132	In order to avoid this, a summer project should be designed by teachers instead of students 
2133	they know the curriculum well, 
2134	will take it seriously, 
2135	can use it as an opportunity to set the expectations for the upcoming school year. 
2136	It is most logical and effective for a teacher to design summer projects. As the people who teach the class, teachers are the ones who will know what skills the students must practice in order to succeed in the class.  Therefore, there is no one better fit to prepare the students than the teacher. 
2137	Through observation, it can be seen that the majority of the teen population does not stay ambitious or dedicated to school during the summer time. Due to this, it makes no sense why teachers would trust students to dedicate their time and effort into designing a well-thought out project instead of dismissing it so that they may enjoy their summer. Teens want to forget about school as summer time comes around, they do not want to spend it preparing for more school. For instance, if a student has the choice between an easy project or a truly helpful, but complicated and tedious project, observation shows that they are most likely to choose the easier option. Teachers should design the project because they would not be as tempted to simplify the project for the sake of their own self desires like students may. In the earlier situation, teachers would most likely choose the harder project because they know it would benefit the students in the long run. Since teachers would be more responsible and serious with the project, they are the ideal designers for it. 
2138	For example, a highly detailed and extensive project would indicate a rigorous class. The projects are an opportunity for teachers to introduce and exemplify the expectations of the students---in this case, high expectations. This sneak peek into class life would hopefully prevent unpreparedness from students and help the class run more smoothly. Teacher-designed projects have also been shown to benefit students by preventing a switch of classes during the school year: a junior at Generic_School decides to switch out of her Spanish 5 class during the summer after attempting the summer assignment. If it were designed by the teacher, it would be just like assignments from the class itself. This demonstrates the advantage of having the opportunity to work on an assignment that mirrors the work done in a possible class: a student essentially gains the ability to do a test run to see if they like it or not. That junior would have gotten stuck in the class and performed poorly if it were not for the summer assignment. Therefore, summer assignments should be designed by teachers to give students an idea of what to expect and what is expected of them. 
2139	Teachers are the best fit to design summer assignments for students because, unlike teens with only fun and relaxation on their minds who would not take the project seriously, teachers can create an assignment that will prepare the student for the specified curriculum and demonstrate what they expect from them. This should have tremendous benefits when it comes to student preparedness, class switches, and student success. 
2140	A student-designed project may sound like a good idea because it opens up the opportunity for students to be creative and show what they know, 
2141	however, in reality, most students simply will not put enough effort into it. Perhaps if teenagers were more passionate about school during the summer it would work, but until then, teachers remain the best candidate for designing summer assignments. 
2142	As the times have progressed, cell phones have become extremely prevalent in the daily lives of many. To add on, cell phone usage has also increased substantially. From playing music in the shower to using phones to keeping daily tasks organized, cell phones have grown to become an essential part of human life. It is hard to deny that cell phones have become so infused in our daily lives. This has caused many to pose the question as to whether or not cell should be allowed to be used in any capacity when operating a vehicle. While a total ban of cellphone usage may seem unrealistic,using a phone at any capacity not only poses a threat to the driver or the passengers but also other drivers on the road 
2143	To begin, cell phone usage when driving can cause a major distraction to the driver who is operating the vehicle. 
2144	"All cell phone users can vouch that having a cell phone comes with understanding that there are a plethora of different applications going on within that minuscule device. Loud notifications from social media sites and vibrating text messages from friends and family, even though they may seem important, are all distractions that come with having a device. When someone is distracted, their reaction time when operating the vehicle becomes impaired which poses a threat to everyone on the road, even if they are just a passenger. If cell phone usage is banned from drivers, it would not be the first time or first ""place"" that cell phone usage has been barred from. Cell phone usage has been restricted or banned from vital places such as school and the workforce. This is all for the reason that it can alter that particular person's effectiveness when trying to conduct or produce work. If cell phones are not allowed in these places because they distract people so greatly, why should they be allowed when someone is operating a car that weighs a few tons? "
2145	According to a study conducted in 1995, only 13 percent of the United States population owned cell phones. This statistic goes to prove that before cell phones became widely popular; people were able to operate vehicles without it. Some may argue that phones provide GPS services that assist in getting drivers to their destination,which by all accounts is true. However, phones aren't the only devices that provide GPS services. There are actual GPS devices that prove way more accurate than cell phone applications. Also, these GPS devices pose way less of a threat when it comes to distracting drivers as they are strictly meant for giving directions instead of having multiple purposes. If drivers have some kind of emergency such as a death or injury in the family, drivers can pull into a parking lot or pull over on the side of the road in order to communicate with whomever they need to communicate with. There is no acceptable reason as to why one should be using their cell phone while operating a vehicle. 
2146	Lastly, when operating a vehicle in general you have the ability to kill someone due to your attention being impaired. 
2147	When adding a person using a phone while operating a vehicle, the risk of killing someone increases. When operating a cellphone while driving, the drivers eyes can be taken off the road from anywhere to a few seconds to a few minutes. Driving is not a perfect situation. People constantly break,stop, speed up, and slow down. Taking eyes off the road for even one second can cause a serious accident on the road. The president of the National Safety Council reported that talking on a cellphone while driving makes one four times more likely to get in a crash. Talking on a phone is such a risk that the National Safety Council has called for a total ban on cell phone usage when driving due to the fact that 100 million people use their phones in a day. Using a cell phone when driving can not only jeopardize the drivers life but also passengers in their car and others on the road. Driving while using a device has the ability to cause a premature death when the drivers are distracted.  
2148	Cell phone usage when operating a vehicle at any capacity is extremely dangerous. This kind of activity poses a threat to not only drivers themselves but passengers and also other users of the road. Cell phone usage when driving can cause drivers to be distracted which in turn if not careful can cause a car crash that leads to serious injuries or death. Furthermore, cell phone usage in a car is not essential and drivers do not need it in order to drive. There is no reasonable explanation as to why cell phones should be used when driving. Laws need to be enacted in order to ban this unacceptable behavior and protect road users. 
2149	Although summer is considered as a break from school, it is a rather perfect opportunity for students to continue working on assignments in order to keep the ideas they learned over the course of the year fresh in their minds before they head back. To do this, many schools are adopting mandatory summer projects for students to complete before their next school year will begin. These projects will stimulate critical thinking and sharpen the skills that students have learned in their previous year. Although many parents think that teachers know the capabilities of their student, which is why they should be the ones to design it 
2150	it should be student designed 
2151	Even though many teachers claim that they are very close with their students, in truth, they do not know much about what their students do. During the summer, aside from going on family vacations and other recreational activities, many students have responsibilities like volunteer work, internships, jobs, taking care of siblings, and etc. that take up a lot of time out of their day. Teachers do not know a student's life outside of academics and will therefore not consider these aspects of their life. As a result, teachers will most likely design a project that could be very time consuming and strenuous for students. However, if the project is student-designed, it would be designed knowing that students have other responsibilities outside of of academics. 
2152	With the schedule of a student in mind, the project will be designed in a way that will be evenly spread out content wise, with enough time to complete each assignment. 
2153	Just because students on average found a certain topic difficult does not mean that all will; and some will find a different one difficult. By gathering a group students, the students will be able to pin point which topics are easy and which will require more explaining. Additionally even if teachers were able to successfully identify which topics are troublesome for students, they will not be able to solve the issue present in the most simplest way. Recently the demand for tutors is growing and the reason is that is many of these tutors are young. They have only recently finished their studies. But most importantly, their age gap between their tutees, the students that tutors help, is a measly couple of years, compared to the decades of years between students and teachers. Because of this minuscule age gap, these tutors understand a student's difficulties better. They have gone through the problems that their tutee is going through very recently. As result of this, unlike teachers who will provide a lengthy explanation that was told to them by their professors many years prior, tutors will explain how to solve these problems more efficiently and accurately. Similarly, that is why students, knowing where their peers' difficulties lay, will be able to able to create assignments that are specifically targeted towards students and their success in the content. 
2154	With these summer projects, students will successfully master their acquired skills from the previous year and get a head start in their studies for their year to come. Due to this, students will face a smooth transition from their prior grade to their next. Additionally, by making these projects student designed, the projects will not interfere in their day to day activities during the summer and will provide assignments that will efficiently target students' weak areas and strengthen them. Both of these goals will be met by including enough time each assignment and including easy to follow videos, created by students, explaining difficult topics. 
2155	They know what is needed for us to know by the time the next school year comes around, 
2156	most of the time they have a better understanding of what we need to learn 
2157	if kids were to design the summer projects they will most likely forget many factors or make it too easy and not put as much effort into it. 
2158	Teachers should gather together and create the summer projects based off what they know that we will need to know for the upcoming years. 
2159	This can be really helpful because most kids think that some things we learn will not be useful or won't do us any good but the only ones who really know what will be needed for the years to come, are the teachers. This can be such an advantage for the students and teachers. Instead of the teachers spending so much time in the beginning of the year going back over what we learned the year before they can just get right into the lesson because what needed to be reviewed has already been refreshed in our memories over the summer because of the project. By teachers creating the summer project, it can help make class time more valuable and it can help spend less time on reviewing things from previous years. 
2160	Teachers have the best way of helping us understand what we need to learn and most of the time they know what is best for our learning. That is why we have teachers, so we can be taught what we need to know. 
2161	A big part in learning for many students is being challenged. 
2162	Do you really think if a student designed the summer project that it will be challenging ? or will it be so easy that it doesn't really help the student grasp the concept of the material ? Many students find ways to do just the bare minimum to get them by, or they find ways to get the project done without really knowing what they are even being taught or to get it done without knowing what they are really doing. Many teachers find or have many different ways to help students understand what is being taught and also make sure that student is actually trying and getting by so easy. Most students will do what they have to do to get them by and that isnt really helping us learn. 
2163	I disagree that all students must participate in a extracurricular activity 
2164	not all students have the time to be in a extracurricular activity 
2165	It is contradictive that he decided to include facts and data that went against his own thoughts because he came back and listed data that went against the negative statements. The author created confusion to what he actually believes. 
2166	"That suggests that we already know some facts about Venus such as it's density and size, which is enough to make people curious to how much about Venus we already know. He said that we know that Venus has many similar structures to Earth, such as mountains, valleys, and craters. If Venus is Earth's ""twin,"" doesn't mean that it is extremely similar to Earth? The statement could make people curious about how close Venus really is to Earth, or it could make them wonder why we should bother risking people's safety if we already know that Venus is just like Earth "
2167	The author also brought up the dangers of visiting Venus multiple times. Then, he would proceed to follow the statement with tested and untested solutions. It was hard to tell which way he sided 
2168	"According to the author, ""Venusian geolegy and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes to probes..."" He later stated that NASA has a possible idea to send blimp-like vehicles to travel the surface of Venus, but that would not provide a detailed enough view of the ground. In order to get his point across to the audience, he should not have kept going agianst information "
2169	The author went off topic throughout the article. The different information created slight confusion as to what the message he was trying to convey 
2170	"The author stated that NASA is working on an approach to studying Venus that involves mechanical computers. He then said, ""The thought of computers existing in those days may sound shocking, but these devices make calculations by using gears and levers..."" It is irrelevant to the message when the mechanical computers were envisioned or the fact that it is shocking to hear that computers existed in 1940. It was hard to understand why computers were important to the article at all. The author made it difficult to focus on the message when he was stating random facts that were not important to the idea he was trying to support. "
2171	The author did not make it extremly obvious as to what he was truly trying to convey. If he would been more clear and less contradictive, then it would have been more obvious that he supports the idea that Venus is worthy of being explored. Also, it would have been easier to understand the point he was trying to put across if he would have stayed on topic throughout the article. The message of the article should be obviously supported by the author.      
2172	it could possible benefit kid in learning. Which means helping kids with better learning that is gong to benefit them by getting up and doing an activity that might help refresh their minds 
2173	According to a studies done by Virginia Techs mental studies, states that 74% of students fall asleep or day dream and stop listening and the other 26% of students listen and learn because they are involed in activities that help refresh there minds and givings them time to thing. What this means is that 74% of student stop listening do to being board or just no intrested but the other 26% is in a club or sport that helps that student refresh their mind and helps them think so they are ready for classes and other work that is needed to be done. 
2174	It's a week before your junior year starts. You're laying in bed, soaking up your last few days of freedom. Then it hits you- you have a book report due the first day of school. Panic sets in, chaos erupts. Oh, the joy of summer projects. Most students have been through the process of completing a summer project. In most circumstances, these projects are a strict set of directions created by the teacher. Summer projects are expected, especially when taking difficult classes. 
2175	Students, due to different commitments, should be able to design their own summer projects.  
2176	Teenagers today are exposed to a lot more than when our parents were our age. Some of those things aren't beneficial, such as too much screen time or drinking underage. But, a lot of this exposure is good. We're exposed to different cultures at an early age, we have easier access to education, and we know when disaster strikes, it's our responsibility to help. Because of all this new exposure, students often make commitments over the summer. Students accepted into college summer programs go to learn more about something their interested in. Some make the world a better place by doing service with a church group or other organizations. College is expensive, so a large quantity of teenagers get a summer job to save up money. There's always going to be the group of teenagers who sit at home all summer watching TV and eating junk food. 
2177	With this wide variety of responsibilities and commitments, having every student complete the same exact summer project is unreasonable. 
2178	At most schools, you don't meet your teacher until a week prior to school starting. Knowing nothing about the class is a scary thought if you're spending hours a day working on a summer project, assigned by a teacher you've never met. 
2179	If students were able to design their own summer project, it would not only give them creative freedom but allow them to feel proud of what they turn in, regardless if they stay in the class. 
2180	No student enjoys writing an essay every time they do a project, so if the projects were created by students the final results could be even more outstanding than what any teacher could've designed.  
2181	If students are designing their own summer projects, it not only shows their personality and character- it raises their expectations for the class in the best way possible. 
2182	Summer projects aren't a bad thing. They not only keep a student's brain activated during the summer, but they give them a taste of a class before they commit fully. Because of all the opportunities we have as teenagers in today's age, our schedules can get pretty busy. Although, I do still think an education is important. Summer projects allow students to ease themselves back into the routine of the school year before it hits them like a train. If those projects are student designed, it allows us to learn about time and self management. They also allow us to express our creativity. I'm not saying someone who draws a stick figure should get the same credit as someone who writes a five page essay. In my ideal situation, the teacher can give their students a vague set of directions so the students are free to express themselves.  
2183	passengee cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car intensive in the United States. 
2184	On a hot summer day I remembered that I have to do my summer project. Before I started my project I thought to myself, how would summer assignments be like if it was designed by students. But then I rememebered how teachers are much more experienced in making assignments. 
2185	Although some may believe otherwise, summer projects should be teacher-designed 
2186	Teachers should be the ones to create summer projects because they are know how to motivate their students 
2187	"For example, my trigonmetry teacher gave me a lot of praise when I got an ""A"" on the last test. These praises pushed me to continue doing well in the class. When teachers acknowledge students progress, it motivates students to succeed. For instance, Abraham Lincoln grew up in poverty and had to do farming and go to school at the same time. Despite knowing his background, his teachers encouraged him to focus on his education because he was a great student. Eventually, he was able to afford a higher education and went on to become the president of the United States. The motivation that teachers give to students enables students to become successful in the future. "
2188	For example, my friend Generic_Name turned in her english essay four days late. Her teacher realized when the assigment was handed in late that she needed to work on her time management skills. Therefore, she guided Generic_Name with her next essay by explaining how it would be easier to start planning earlier in order to turn in her essay on time. Now, Generic_Name makes it a priority to turn in all of her assignments in on time. Another example of teachers giving students good advise is when Oprah Winfrey was doing very well in school. Her teachers saw that she had exceptional work habits and urged her to get a higher level of education. Now, she has become a famous philanthropist that helps many people in the world through her talk shows and interviews. Teachers advise encourages students to work harder and continue to progress in everything that they do. 
2189	Some may believe that summer projects should be student-designed in order for students to take on more responsibility. 
2190	While understandable, this is inaccurate because students already have a lot of responsibilities. For instance, my friend Generic_Name, has a part time job, plays baskeball, and tutors her younger siblings. It would be difficult for her to create a summer project because she has so many other responsbilities. If she would have to design a summer project she wouldn't be able to give her time to her other priorities. Furthermore, making a summer project would result in her being stressed out. 
2191	 Summer projects should be teacher-designed because they know how to motivate and advise students. Teachers are always seen as inspirations because of all that they do. Therefore, taking away their right to make summer projects for students would negatively influence society because they would feel unappreciated. Additonally, the way classrooms run would be completely transformed. Overall, this topic will always remain an important topic because it reflects personal opinion.    
2192	Teachers control almost every aspect of a student's education.  They assign heavy loads of homework expecting it to be complete and correct when turning it in, and then assign unnecessary amounts of classwork and projects to finish for homework at the same time.  Students struggle and work hard to succeed in their classes while getting good grades, but that can come at a price of a lack of sleep, free time, and even a decreasing mental stability.  Summer is suppose to be a time of relaxation and fun, a break from the stresses of school.  But, teachers assigning work over the summer, so students can maintain their education, can prevent relaxation and add stresses to what is suppose to be the most care free time in a student's career. 
2193	Although, teachers assigning teacher designed work to students work over the summer establishes more structure and easier communication on the assignment and its requirements, 
2194	When people think of summer they think of fun, traveling, relaxation, and most importantly no school work.  Students work tirelessly all year, summer is students' free time, and if students have to work during their free time it should be under their regulation what their assignments consist of.  Students creating their own assignments can be more enjoyable, stipulating their interests and help them learn information and lessons.  School projects over the summer assigned by teachers can come in bulk and most of the time is boring.  But, if students developed their own assignments for the summer then it could possibly be more enjoyable and help them learn more, for example a student would enjoy creating a graphic image project of information versus writing a paper that a teacher would normally assign.  Allowing students to take the lead and create their own projects can relieve the stress of summer work by them making it pertain to their interests.  In addition to an interest increase comes a comprehension increase, because students who enjoy more comprehend more. 
2195	Allowing choice and design of assignment gives a sense of freedom, which is what students, especially teenage students, crave after months of teachers telling them what to do. 
2196	Although students creating their own assignments can create more interest and learning opportunities for them, teacher assignments provide a type of structure, formality, and stability it might be difficult for the student to achieve in their design. 
2197	Students may have a difficult time choosing a topic, method, or creation needed to design an assignment, especially because teachers have given the students topics and requirements necessary the entire year, so students never acquired the skill for creating assignments.  Also, there is the possibility that students don't want to create their own assignment and want to stick to the teacher's book.  Teacher instructions on assignments are usually clear and straight forward, which could be a lot easier for a student to understand.  As well as provides the knowledge the student will need to remember during the summer.  Otherwise, if students design their own assignment they might fail to retain the knowledge needed, be confused on the purpose, and not be able to fully carry out the assignment creation. 
2198	A big concern about summer assignments is the time allotted and if the students will actually comprehend the information meant to be maintained.  Students and their families plan their summer lives months before summer work is assigned, and if people go on a two month vacation to Europe then they can't necessarily complete all the work assigned.  Teenagers have jobs and children go on weeks long vacations with their parents, and they might not have the time to complete or fully understand the purpose of the project. 
2199	If students created their own assignments then they could work the time for the completion of the school project around their schedules and manage their time better. 
2200	Students should be allowed the privilege of designing their own summer projects.  Even though teachers assigning work gives structure and stability in the assignments, students designing work can increase their freedom, interest, and comprehension of their education.  Also, students will learn responsibility and leadership in the process of creating and following through with their very own assignment.  This will help prepare them for future creations, lean off the dependency of a teacher giving them all the work needed for their learning, while allowing the the enjoyment of summer.  So let the students lead and help shape their own education.                 
2201	Warm and soothing waves of light, the eloquent smell of nature and the outdoors, summer is indeed here. For some, summer is a much needed break from the institutional grind of schooling in America, however for others it irritates their stress. Often, students worry about the projects assigned over the summer, because they're usually tedious and require an exorbitant amount of time to complete. Although it is noted that they're a source of stress to many students, schools maintain that these projects are needed to continuously engage the students in the learning process. This predicament can be resolved by allowing students to design their own projects, which adequately shows their learning throughout the summer. 
2202	to engage students in learning, 
2203	allow them to be cooperative amongst each other, 
2204	prevent the monotonous nature of education in America. 
2205	Students in America struggle throughout their life attending school while accepting the burden of friendships, family and other stresses and anxieties. Summer becomes that safe haven for them, to completely decompress from their issues and take a break from the mental strain of schools, with all the tests, exams and projects that're encompassed within it. Students who are allowed the opportunity to design their own project become eager to create a product which displays their learning over the summer. Once in my freshman year, I was given an option to complete a teacher-assigned book report, or to construct an independent book report. Being allowed this opportunity made me eager to chose a book that satisfied my interests, and not be punished to endure reading a four hundred page book about trivial history. This point illustrates the impact that student-designed summer projects can instill, without the students feeling punished by the school. Learning should be a process of critical thinking and analysis, however when this process is interrupted by an external predetermined body it is detrimental to one's education. 
2206	Cooperation is a skill which gives people the ability to build upon each others strengths and weaknesses, and is the source of many significant discoveries. Often we see that the scientific community caters to its researchers by promoting peer-reviewed journals and research to be conducted. This sentiment holds true with education in America. In order for students to learn over the summer, they should be encouraged to produce their own projects with individuals whom they spend their time with during the summer. I recall being pestered by taking on the burden of conducting a lab report by myself, which caused me to feel stressed out and disengaged. One day in physics class, my teacher allowed me to conduct a lab with many of my friends to make the lab procedure dynamic. I found that by being with my contemporaries, I was inclined to learn more about physics, and to collect accurate and precise data. Students who create their own projects are allowed the opportunity to learn through cooperation, which betters suits them especially during summer break. Many students are already flustered by the work load they receive during the school year, furthermore projects in summer break should bring students together in learning not steer them away in frustration. 
2207	We've all seen the stereotypical depiction of education in today's society. Classes upon hallways upon schools of mindless zombies who've been bombarded with unfulfilling tasks, which demoralizes their sense to learn. Why should summer projects further foster this reality into summer vacation? Isn't the point of summer break to allow students to have time to themselves? Education is a crucial institution in America, however we must not mistake it for being the only source of learning. Learning is a life skill that ascends the classrooms and school hallways, and enters the hearts of students throughout this nation. To allow students the chance to dictate their own project gives them empowerment to extend curiosity and discovery to outside the classroom. Having done project based learning in school, I can undoubtedly state that the monotonous nature of school deprives students our freedom to learn without restrictions. Of course the material must be covered, the criteria and standards must be met and the exams must be taken, but summer time is different. Summer time should be the students' time, therefore permitting student-designed projects gives students the freedom to learn unrestricted without the monotone school structure. 
2208	Although some may believe otherwise, summer projects should be student-designed to produce engagement in learning, cooperation amongst students and disrupt the monotonous school-oriented learning process. Education has always been a field where curiosity, and desires to innovate have been facilitated to bring about improvement in society. We can't always judge the circumstances to which things are, without providing a valid solution as to how those things ought to improve. Summer projects is that annual cycle where this principle can be enacted in the future. Projects designed to be student oriented can reinvigorate that desire for young people to go research and explore, while shattering the illusion of what education is depicted to be in America. What better way can we allow the continuous process of learning over the summer, than by putting the keys of that exploration in the hands of the future generation? 
2209	I think every student should participate in an activity like sports, a musical in s trument class, or some sort of club. This would help students to learn and develop talents and skills 
2210	If students do after schools activities like sports they will be able to exercise and practice coordination with friends. 
2211	One big thing that I will really like about this is that it gives students more time to socialize mwith friends 
2212	In 1988 a Viking 1 took a, slightly disturbing, picture. Of a face! Viking 1 found a landform that happends to look like an Egyptian Pharoah. This face was found and started major controversy.  Some people had thought that it was fake and others thought that it was just a coincidence. The massive sand storms just created a face. That's all that they thought. But can that be true?  
2213	"While describing why scientists consider visits to venus, the author states ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in out solar system...The value of returning to Venus seems indisputable""(4).  By presenting that scientists want to visit Venus then almost immediately jumping to the weak conclusion that the ""value of returning to Venus seems indisputable"", the author fails to explain why the scientists want to visit Venus and why those reasons are important or significant.  Without an explanation of facts, writers leave the reader to create conclusions in their own minds, possibly without a complete understanding, weakening the authors support of his or her own claim or idea. "
2214	Second, the author doesn't support the idea effectively because he or she creates the picture in the reader's mind that successful and worthwhile travel to Venus is nearly impossible and certainly not attainable with today's technology. 
2215	"While writing on what would be necessary for travel and observation of Venus, the author states ""a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions...[and be] survivable for humans.  However, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions...[Also,] standard forms of photography...[would be] innefective...Therefore, sciendtists seeking to...understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risks""(5).  By stating that ""a vehicle hovering over Venus"" would be safe for humans and then directly stating that it would not be enough and that scientists who want useful information would have to ""get up close and personal despite the risks"", the author states conflicting ideas.  In addition, earlier in the passage the author states ""On the planet's surgace, temperatures average over 800 degrees""(3).  This creates another serious flaw in the author's idea, because the conditions stated are not even close to survivable. "
2216	Combining the evidence presented by the author would point to the conclusion that astronomers would need to be using vehicles and photography equipment that currently don't exist and, even with unavailable technology, they must be willing to die to travel to Venus for study.  This creates the idea in the reader's head that studying Venus is impossible, which greatly weakens the author's claim.  All in all, impossibilities, conflicting ideas, and a lack of explanation of evidence crontribute to a weak argument in favor of the idea that studing Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. 
2217	Imagine this routine. Wake up, go to school, come home, do homework, go to bed, repeat. Sounds boring right? But somewhere between those steps, imagine doing an activity that you love. Makes it a lot more fun doesn't it? 
2218	it helps them try new things, 
2219	it allows people to focus on something besides schoolwork. 
2220	I have been dancing since I was three years old and I only did ballet back then but as I got older I started more styles such as tap, jazz, lyrical, musical theatre, contemporary, and I still do ballet. Doing all of those styles has made me a versatile dancer. On average I dance about 14 hours a week and it's incredibly tiring but it's also my passion and I love it. I wouldn't want to be doing anything else. Dancing has made me branch out, make new friends, and do what I love. Doing this activity has helped me figure out what I want to be doing forever. Being involved in dance has let me find out my passion and allowed me to become a stronger person. 
2221	"The author shows that the huge rock formation, which resembles a human head, is formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth. The author also states that Garvin said, ""as a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger that the pixel size, so if there were objects in this picture like, airplaines on the ground, or Egytian-style pyramids, or even small shacks, you could see what they were!""  "
2222	The author states that scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa when the face appeared. This shows that they have seen things like this before and they knew that it wasn't real, or alien like. Another example that the author proves is that Garvin said it reminded him of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face and perhaps alien markings were hidden by haze. Also NASA can be hidding information about the Face. But, you can see that the Face is formed by shadows, and not an alien haze. 
2223	Have you ever been on an amazing trip? Have you ever seen many amazing sites? Have you ever been on a long boat trip? Do you want to help people? Do you want to care for animals? 
2224	It is fun and educational for any one at any age 
2225	It is an amazing chance to get into this program and visit the unique places on the way to the adventure. 
2226	This is an amazing adventure I have been on it I have seen so many places and met many amazing people on the way. 
2227	While I was in the Seagoing Cowboys program I made nine trips it was the most of any Seagoing Cowboy it was great. I saw so many amazing places I thought I would never be able to see because I was just a normal person in my town. I saw Europe and China while I was in the program it was a great experience for me as a almost adult. I also had the advantage of taking a gondola ride in Venice,Italy, it was the city with the streets of water. I also had a awesome chance at touring the excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China in the Seagoing trip. You should join it so you can see all those amazing places I just stated to you that I have seen because of this amazing experience in the Seagoing Cowboys. Another reason you should join it is because if you are almost 18 and you do not want to get military drafted then join this, they count it as your service or they did for me which means they will for you. Another one is after the animals get dropped off and we are going back with no animals we get to play amazing games in the stalls that the animals were in like baseball and volleyball, we also played table-tennis tournaments or even boxing.  These are all the amazing things i got to do and see, you could see and do them to if you join Seagoing Cowboys. 
2228	That's why if my principal decided to make me do an extracurricular activity I would disagree 
2229	they don't want to do an activity at school or they already are doing an activity 
2230	One reason I would disagree is because some people are just way to busy and if principle makes them do an extracurricular activity that might cause stress to them and that could be adding more to their schedule which would be a struggle to maintain all of work I may have to do already especially as child . 
2231	For example is someone has an activity out of school like dance on Monday and the principle makes them do another activity on that day it would be hard for them to stay after for that activity if she have another place to go already , and that's why that would be adding more to there schedule and would be hard to maintain another example is maybe I have a lot of school work I have to do or I have to study for a test and you don't have time to stay after for an activity that could also cause stress .Thats one reason why I disagree to making people do an extracurricular activity . 
2232	another reason I disagree is because some people aren't interested in what the school offers and if the principle makes them do something they don't want to do that would make them feel like they are forced to pick out of options they don't like . 
2233	Say for example my school only offers basketball ,track and cheer leading ,but I really want to do soft ball that could be forcing me too do a sport I would not like to do . For another example say your school offers languages for and extracurricular activity like french and Spanish but he/she wanted to learn another language that would be be hard for me because maybe I only wanted learn language. That's another reason why I do disagree with making people do extracurricular activities. 
2234	The last reason I disagree with making people do extracurricular activities is because maybe i'm he/she is not a very social person and they do not like to meet new people and they are very shy it could make people uncomfortable and nervous 
2235	For example he/she is made to join an activity and they feel left out because everyone else has friends and are talking too people they make them feel bad because they are not a social person. Another example is say that may not be a very athletic person and thy have to participate in a sport that could also make them feel like they are forced to do something they would not like to do and make them feel uncomfortable as well ,and thats why I disagree with making people do extracurricular activity 
2236	If a driver is using their cell phone, it means that their visual focus has become divided and the potential for an accident is greatly increased. 
2237	According to The United States Department of Transportation, cellphones are the cause of 1.6 million car crashes per year in the U.S. Driving a car requires a certain amount of focus, coordination, and reflexes in order to drive safely. Humans can only focus on so much at once, so unnecessary operation of a cellular device is highly advised against when doing something as potentially dangerous as driving. 
2238	Almost all students love Summer vacation. But this time out of school is also a major halt in leaning. This halt can cause students to fall out of the rhythm of daily learning and cause them to forget material taught during the previous school year. This is why schools started implementing Summer projects to keep students engaged in learning. Summer projects have been traditionally designed by teachers but some people argue that students should be designing these projects. 
2239	they know more about the material, 
2240	they would make it challenging enough, 
2241	it would be an easy and simple process.  
2242	One reason teachers should be designing the Summer projects is because they know more about the material. 
2243	Many of these teachers have been teaching this information for a couple years. This means that these teachers have a good idea of what the students know from this school year and what information they should be prepared for in the coming school year. This information would greatly aid in making the Summer projects because the teachers would know how to format it in a way that students are familiar with but also prepares them for the new information that will be presented in the next school year. This would be very helpful to kids because it sets them up for success in the next year. 
2244	Another reason why teachers should be designing the Summer projects is because they would make it challenging enough. 
2245	The last reason teachers should be designing the Summer projects is because it would be a easy and simple process 
2246	If a couple teachers get together and make the Summer project it would be easy for them to make a rubric to go along with it. If the students make the Summer project then it would be much more of complicated .  The students would most likely have to brainstorm ideas and pick one for the project which would take time, then pitch the idea to the teachers and wait for approval, and then after all that is done the teachers have to use a project that they did not make to create a rubric for grading. This seems like a lot of extra work when it could easily be simplified by the teachers creating the project. 
2247	Some people may argue that if the kids design the project they will be more engaged and willing to complete it, 
2248	Summer projects are extremely helpful and important to students learning experience. This is why it is so important that these projects are well constructed and thought out. Considering all this, it is clear that the best people to complete the task of creating these projects are teachers. 
2249	One reason why clubs should be required in school is that being in a club provides skills that are extremely helpful throughout life. 
2250	According to Brian Scott, an expert on youth development at the University of Social Sciences, extracurricular activities in school are some of the best ways that the youth can prepare to enter the working world. Scott explains that this is true because after school activities give kids further experience with important skills such as communication and team work. Furthermore, a study conducted by the Department of Youth Development found that 87% of adults who participated in extracurricular activities in school thought that being in an extracurricular activity gave them skills that helped them later in life. One possible reason why extracurricular activities could have helped people after they have completed their schooling experience is that it gave them important skills and character traits such as perseverance or good communication. All things considered, extracurricular activities give those who participate quality life skills. 
2251	Another reason why after school activities should be required is that it gives the participants helpful experience. 
2252	"Evidence for this is found by the University of Statistics who conducted a study that found that 76% of people who were a part of extracurricular activities during their school experience thought that the experience from those clubs is helpful to them in their careers. Some ways that clubs can help in careers is it can give students experience in their chosen career path. Examples of clubs that are best at providing experience specific to future careers is the math club where students can participate in competitions or the newspaper club where students can practice for journalism. The experience students gain from joining extracurricular activities in school can also be helpful when applying to colleges, if students choose to go down that route. According to the board of applications for the prestigious College of Law, one of the top things they look for in an application is what extracurricular activities the applicant participated in while in school. One member even said, ""I value extracurriculars even more than the grade point average when I am decided who gets in."" "
2253	Another reason why extracurricular activities can be beneficial to students is that it gives students an opportunity to make new friends with similar interests. 
2254	The Department of Youth Statistics stated that one of the best ways for students to make friends is by letting students choose what activities to do and pairing those with similar interests together. That is exactly what clubs do. Furthermore, it is proven by the University of Psychology that when students have a healthy amount of friends, they are less likely to fail their classes and more likely to succeed. Based on that, extracurricular activities can cause students to be more successful than their peers who do not partake in those activities.  
2255	"However, some people argue that students should be able to choose whether or not they want to participate in extracurricular activities in school. They cite people such as Jessica Grant, a professor from the West Virginia University of Psychological Studies, who said, ""when people have a choice in what they do, they tend to feel the benefits much more than those who are forced to do something."" "
2256	"While that might be true, students who are required to participate in at least one extracurricular do have a choice in what club or clubs they join. That choice is explained well by Dr. Matthew Brown, a professor of psychology at the University of Washington State who said, ""even when students are required to participate in something -- either a class or an activity -- they still always have some sort of choice, whether that is what activity to do or what mindset to have."" Using both sets of logic previously stated, when the students choose what club to participate in, they will experience the largest amount of positive results.  "
2257	a requirement in schools should be extracurricular activities. Clubs give students important life skills and experiences, as well as new friends. If clubs are required, then young adults would be much more prepared to transition out of school and in to the working world. 
2258	students will be more interested in the project 
2259	the grades will be higher, 
2260	it will make life easier on teachers.  
2261	If students are designing the project they must do over summer break then it will be on something interesting so they have more fun with it over summer. Student designed projects will be on a topic that interests them. 
2262	Another great reason the students should get to design is that the overall grades on this project will be higher. 
2263	It is very unlikely that students get a high grade on something that they didn't enjoy doing, which is why if students designed their own project then they will likely get a higher grade on it. For students working on something that is not enjoyable will result in a lack of effort and a worse grade. If the students got to pick there own project then they will enjoy working on it and will then get a better grade because they gave more effort. Coming up with their own project will also serve as extra motivation to get a good grade on the project. If students created there own project then they won't want to fail something that they made. That extra motivation to not fail something that they created will result in higher overall grades on the project. This another good reason as to why students should be allowed to create their own projects over the summer.  
2264	A third good reason as to why summer projects should be student made is that it will make life easier for the teachers 
2265	It is good for teachers if students make their own project because then teachers don't have to work late coming up with a project. If teachers are forced to work longer to come up with a project then it might not be that good. It won't be a good project because teachers will start to get tired which will result in errors on the project, which is why students should make their own project. students designing their own project will also give teachers extra time to do other things. while the students are coming up with ideas on what the project should be about teachers will have time to grade all the other work the students have. This will also remove the pressure off the teacher because instead of worrying about making a project they will be able to com up with better lesson plans and more fun stuff to do while school is still going on. 
2266	"The new ""hands free"" law is a law where no one can hold their phone while driving. This has effected people with older cars and even newer cars to this day. As this law is in set, people have to connect their phone to Bluetooth to be able to talk on the phone. For example, if you're driving and someone calls, you have to have your phone connected to Bluetooth to be able to talk. In some cases this can be bad for the driver and other people driving on the road also. If your phone isn't connected to Bluetooth while you're driving, there can be a high risk of a crash when you're connecting your phone to Bluetooth. In some cases, there could also be an emergency call you have to answer, and people that don't have Bluetooth in their car can be effected by this law "
2267	Although the government thinks the hands free law is going to help the risk of crashes, the hands free law could be much less safe than using your hands. 
2268	For students, summer break is a time where school is just a figment of their imagination. Once school is out and summer begins, students dispose of the material they have obtained during the year to make room for the amazing memories of the summer. Teachers and staff know that learning is not what is on a child's mind when school is out of session, so they create summer projects to ensure that their students are still gaining knowledge even when school is out 
2269	Over the summer, teachers create the curriculum that will be used to educate their students throughout the oncoming school year. Therefore, they know exactly what the students need to learn in order to progress, so it would be logical for teachers to design the projects instead of the children 
2270	The teacher will include necessary information and focus on topics that are vital to the education of their students. Schoolchildren are unaware of what the next school year may bring, so if they were to make the projects it would be centered around the wrong ideas and it would be useless and not beneficial to them. 
2271	As previously stated, teachers will provide students with important information in order to prepare them for the next school year. 
2272	When teachers construct these summer projects, they will include challenging material to test the student's knowledge on particular topics. When the children's work is complete and submitted, it allows the teacher to point out strengths and weaknesses of their students. Knowing what subjects students struggle with and also strive in enables the teacher to instruct on the level of the class. Changes can be made to the curriculum and material in order to cater to the needs of the students. 
2273	Some may say that if the projects were student-designed, it would push them to complete the work because they were allowed a say-so in what had to be done. 
2274	Learning occurs when one gains knowledge on things they did not know beforehand, so if they work on topics they are fond of, no learning will take place. In addition, students may not want to expand upon what they already know and challenge themselves because it is summer break, their time to be free. They are likely to do the minimum in order to be done so it leaves available time for more road trips and vacations. 
2275	In conclusion, summer projects should be teacher-designed because they will include important topics, be able to see what students need assistance with, and challenge students beyond what they are comfortable with. Schoolchildren do not know the topics that will be lectured upon in the oncoming year, so they are not fully eligible to create work on things they need to learn about. Also, students are likely to do the bare minimum to allow them time to do other things besides schoolwork.  
2276	the gas that cars release can be harmful to the environment, 
2277	cars overall have been making people much less active, 
2278	we can easily use electric cars instead of cars that run on gasoline. 
2279	"""After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" (Duffer 10). This states that the air has been getting so polluted that some cities have been temporarily banning the use of cars because of this issue. Earth has been getting too polluted and destroyed lately, to the point that some people have been trying to predict an ""end is nigh"" date due to all of these issues with earth. Scientists have been talking about global warming for years now, and the problems we have been having with the greenhouse effect and the ozone layer. ""President Obama's ambitious goals to curb the United States' greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient shift in American behavior: recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" (Elisabeth Rosenthal 29). So it seems that the lower use of cars by Americans has been helping the atmosphere and postponing the date of the complete destruction of the ozone layer. That was why cars have such a big impact on the environment as a whole. "
2280	"One of the largest issues for parents in today's world is trying to get their children away from the computer, television, and cell phone. Technology has lessened the need for toys and books, since children entertain themselves with games on their tablets or books they download also on the tablet. But cars play a big part in this. When a person first gets a car, he/she feels free. You feel like the world is yours because you can go anywhere. But the problem is that people become less social with cars. Instead of going to play a sport with some friends, most people would rather drive somewhere else. It is also the reason the United States is ranked second in country with the most overweight people, vehicles are so unexpensive here that anyone is able to purchase a car and drive to their destination instead of riding a bicycle or skateboard and getting some real exercise. ""Parks and sports centers also have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks"" (Selsky 28). This also shows the improvement on the cities' sidewalks and the increase of people attending parks. Without cars, the streets look better and people recieve more exercise. "
2281	Combining the use of a battery rather than gasoline, and not overusing the car, you will have the perfect combination, which is what everybody should strive to accomplish. Help the environment, and get the right amount of exercise. 
2282	In the end, cars are still one of the most common and one of the greatest things on Earth today. Getting a first car is a dream come true, but too much of it can be harmful. So get some use out of the bicycle, avoid poisoning the atmosphere, and cars will be a vehicle with no reprocautions at all, and it will be the perfect source for transportation, while keeping your morals where they should be. 
2283	After the school year ends, students return to their homes feeling a great sense of relief that the school year is over, and that they're about to get a much needed break. However, just because school has stopped doesn't mean that learning should. Three entire months off is long time, and many students actually forget most of what they learned over the past year and need to be refreshed when they return to school. It would save everyone a lot of time if students came back to school with the last year's information still fresh in their minds. The simple solution to this problem is summer assignments. 
2284	it is critically important that these summer assignments are student-designed, meaning that most of what is done for the assignment is thought of by the student rather than simply following the guidelines of their teacher 
2285	Self-motivated learning is when the student has a desire to learn and therefore works hard to learn information without having to be pushed by their teachers. The truth is that while teachers can relay all the necessary information to students, if the students don't want anything to do with it they will learn far less effectively than students who do want to learn. By asking students to create their own summer assignment, it forces them into a new learning environment in which they have to take charge of their learning. Upon being put into this position, students will have to adapt to learn how to teach themselves information. This is a very valuble life skill that will be very helpful to them later in their lives, as self-education is needed for many things that are not taught in school as well as in the workplace. Motivating themselves is an important skill that can be taught through student-designed summer work. 
2286	giving students the ability to choose between what they have to do for their summer projects enables them to make the topic or submission format something that they are more passionate about than what they might otherwise be taught in school. 
2287	Typically, in a learning context, more passion or excitement transfers to more success at whatever it is the students are trying to learn. Being more passionate about something causes people to interact with it much more, and interaction is key to the learning of many students. In addition, students being excited to do something furthers the self-motivation mentioned above. If there is something that a student wants to do, they will do it without needing a teacher to tell them to. Overall, the passion that comes from student-designed summer work makes it a much more fun and more effective experience for students. 
2288	Teachers work very hard to plan, produce, and grade all of the students' schoolwork for the entire school year. They deserve to have a break! By letting students take charge of their summer work, it takes an extra burden off the shoulders of the people who dedicated their lives to educating America's youth for a meager government salary. With the extra time they have without having to plan and construct a summer assignment, teachers can do many things, such as get the jump on later assignments that they will have to make, enjoy some time with their friends and family, or just get some much needed sleep. This extra time for teachers is another fantastic reason why summer assignments should be student-designed. 
2289	There is no doubt that summer assignments are a necessary part of learning, in order to continue to teach information and to help students remember information that they would otherwise forget. But these assignments should not be simple rubrics and reading notes, they should be something different. Something that is going to have a significant impact on everyone in the education system. Something that will build a strong new generation without overworking the old ones. Those who are students understand the value of enjoying and wanting to learn about a subject, those who are educators know how important it is to be able to motivate yourself to work, and those who are school teachers know that a little extra time and a little less stress goes a very long way. That is why summer assignments should be student designed rather than teacher-designed. 
2290	Imagine you are an already busy highschooler focusing on maintaining your grades and your social life. All of the sudden, your principal decides that each student must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Despite having a lot on your plate, you are now required to alter your weekly schedule in order to comply. 
2291	Forcing students to participate in an extracurricular activity is unethical and promotes involuntary participation to students who are already busy managing grades and a social life 
2292	Students are constantly under pressure from family and peers to maintain perfect scores and attain high grades among their countless classes. Despite time given in school to get work done, many find themselves pouring countless hours over a desk at night, losing sleep for a 4.0 GPA. Students are given numerous assignments from each of their classes. Finishing these projects is difficult enough, and getting an A+ on all of them is even harder. Afterschool is already busy for students who focus on academics, and making them add an extracurricular will possibly lower their grades and motivation for school and grades. 
2293	Hanging out with friends, going out for a coffee, or watching a movie are among the minor things that relieve stress from the life of an average teenager. School can undoubtedly be physically and mentally draining. Therefore, spending a couple hours per week socializing and hanging with friends can help a student immensely. However, these minuscule ways of staying happy can all be taken away when a student is required to make time for an extracurricular activity 
2294	Lastly, forcing a teenager give up valuable time and effort into an unwanted extracurricular is simply unethical and immoral. 
2295	Students should be allowed to explore their interests on their own, as opposed to being forced to participate in something they barely have any connection with. The best way for a student to succeed is to build upon something they already have skills or an interest in, and the activities that the school promote do not cater to each individual student. This new rule promotes involuntary participation and will possibly make teenagers resilient to exploring their interests and values. 
2296	Forcing students to participate in an extracurricular activity is unethical and promotes involuntary participation to students who are already busy managing grades and a social life. Highschoolers, and even middle-schoolers, are constantly under pressure to pursue high academic scores while putting aside time for socialization. This new rule is immoral and does not value student's time or schedule. The school should spread awareness about after school activities so that teenagers can reach out on their own, rather than bluntly making them join an activity they don't have time for or interest for. 
2297	Can you tell the air feels different? Over the past years some countries have put restirctions on car usage. Although this may sound extremely crazy to some, most individuals accept the new law's for car's. 
2298	Motorized vehicles have put a tole on our environment, our well being, and our wallets. 
2299	it has allowed individuals stress level to decrease 
2300	lowered air pollution, 
2301	"Cars are one of the main sources for people's stress, whether it be because of car failures, others who annoy you while you drive, or the fact you can never find a parking spot.  Heidrun Walter claims "" When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much mappier this way ( In German suburb, Life goes on without Cars 3)."" One main reason people are less tense and stress is because people do not have to constantly worry about if another car is about to hit them, if traffic is going to be to slow to get to work, or if your car is going to breakdown on you. Car's create unwanted stress that can be easily avoided. Indeed life would be very different without cars people in Bogota, Paris, and Germany have all been able to function properly without motorized vehicles.  In fact ""70 percdent of Vauban's families do not own cars, and 57 percent sold cars to move her (In German Suburbs, Life goes on without Cars 3)."" These individuals have proven that it is okay to make a switch. "
2302	In order for you to reduce stress in your life, you have to take away the source of stress, and that is what citizens have done, and without cars majority of people are happier and healthier. 
2303	"Due to citizen's of Bogota, Paris, and Germany not using cars and having to switch to bikes, walking, and electric bikes; has greatly reduced toxic gases in the environment. Due to individulas in Paris not excessively using cars the amount of smog has reduced. According to Robert Duffer "" after days of near-record pollutions, paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city( Paris bans driving due to smog 10)."" Paris has enforced strict rules that rejects people from driving, also a switch to diesel fuels. In return these ideas have lowered the level of smog in Paris creating a cleaner environment for the citizen. Not only has Paris help reduce toxic gases from entering our environment, but so has Bogota. In the article Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota, Andrew Selsky stated that this has been Bogota's ""thrid year straight that cars have been banned for one day"" and the only motorized vehicles they have used are ""buses"". This switched has dramatically cut traffic, rush hour, and the amount of smog left in the air. Although there is still traces of pollution after this day it has lowered. "
2304	The reasons are simple, using less cars makes less gases, also those who go the day without using cars may like the change better and permantely switch to a lifestyle without cars. 
2305	"Another thing that has been changed due to the limitation of car usages is that with individuals not having to buy a car, pay for insurance, and pay for gas, it  has increased the amount of money citizens have in their wallets. Citizens of the United States of America have not exactly chosen to not use cars, but some have, the main reason Citizen of America have limited themself is due to a lack of money. During our ""recession"" Americans were ""unemployed"" and ""unable to pay (The end of car culture 32)."" Because citizens were not able to pay for cars, they did not use them, thus as you get adapted to a new situation you tend to stay with it. After the switch citizens who chose to continue a life without a car, were able to have more money because they didnt have to pay for the cost that come with a car. "
2306	Now some citizens have made the switch to not using motorized vehicles, which has helped increase the amount of money citizens have, which is always an advantage because you are able to pay for other things that are neccasary to your life. 
2307	Although cars seem like a material object that is so precious to life, it's not. In all reality people can live a life without cars, citizens in Bogota, Paris, and Germany have, and they enjoy it. Its time to make a switch and make a helpful change in your lifestyle. A life without cars is very benefitial, it is less stressful, lowers pollution, and has an increases of money. Although not using cars is a bit extreme, you can always make a better switch to using electric products, which can also help lower the amount of toxic gases in the air. Gas car's that produce extreme levels of gases are a thing of the past, I believe its time to move to the future.            
2308	"One way that doing an extracurricular activity will provide more learning opportunities is where you have school sponsored, after school activities made to help you in school or in specific subjects. One example of an extracurricular activity is the ""Homework club"". The ""Homework club"" is an after school extracurricular activity created to help you with subjects you are struggling in, assignments you dont quite understand, or school work that you are unable to do at home. This educational club comes with free tutors and teachers that will hopefully be able to answer any question you have and help you with any assignments you need assistance on.  "
2309	There are numourus extracurricular clubs that dont base around education and fitness and these clubs, I would say improve a students social skills. One example of this is the after school tech theater club. This club comes together for about a month to help with the technical side of a Rambunctious theater show. In this club you get to meet new people and are able to help out your department. There are many departments in this club ranging from sound technician to costume and makeup technician. To join this club you have to submit an application and select what department you would like to be in for the production. This department requires team work with your other technicians and I think that this club is a good way to make new friends and teach better social skills. 
2310	"There are many dangers on Venus, including sulfuric acid rain and an atmosphere of nintey seven percent carbon dioxide. Hovering over it would be useless. In paragraph six, it states, ""... peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective."" This states that by hovering on top of the planet, they can't learn anyting they don't already know. "
2311	Although teacher-designed projects would be beneficial for learning in more detail, summer projects should be student-designed 
2312	it allows for the students to be more creative, 
2313	have more freedom, 
2314	be more engaged in their project. 
2315	Student-designed projects allow for students to feel like the project is less of a requirement, and rather more of an enjoyable activity. 
2316	When students design their own project, they let their minds flow freely. This allows for the creation of projects that the students actually are interested in, which helps them become more engaged about whatever the project was about. It is a common belief that teachers should design projects so they can get their students to learn exactly what they need to, and that a student-designed project is not sufficient enough because students will not learn what they need to. However, a project by students allows them to learn content even better because they are choosing what they want to create, not being assigned it, and this creation allows them to explore content in a way that a teacher can't provide. For example, if a student had to create an instrument for music class from scratch, they would be a lot more interested in that than just making a variation of a particular instrument again. The creativity in designing a project is what students need to learn content in a way that is interesting to them, which helps them learn better during a time period where they don't even want to be doing work. 
2317	When a student designs their own project, there are very few restrictions applied. This is good because the students can learn required content however they want to, and they will most often choose to learn it in a way that is effective for them, which a teacher can't always provide. There is the argument that teachers can just give students a variety of options to choose from with a project, and that that freedom in choice will help students learn in a way beneficial to them but unfortunately that just isn't the case. Many students never get to create a project that they actually want to make, and teachers often just repeat options over and over again that students are already familiar with. For example, what if a teacher just kept giving out the same current events question, and a student never got to answer the question they were actually interested in? The freedom in designing a project allows a student to actually want to learn content, since they choose a way to learn content that would be fun to them. 
2318	Many students who complete projects throughout their school careers are not engaged in their work, and are just focused on getting a project done by the deadline with all the requirements. 
2319	Required summer projects by some schools would be most beneficial if they were student-designed, because it would allow for students to be more creative, feel more freedom, and be more engaged in the overall process of learning through a project. This is especially important for summer projects because many students in the summer do not want to do any school work, so a teacher assigning a student another forced project would not motivate them to complete it, while if the student got to design it themselves, they would be more interested and likely create a better project while learning more. Teachers do have the ability to design a project that students would enjoy, but the student-designed project truly allows for more learning by the students because it is more entertaining and an overall better experience. 
2320	These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on planet earth.  
2321	As a student, if I don't understand something in class, I will ask someone about it. Whether that is a teacher, a student, or a parent there is almost always someone who knows. If any one of these reliable sources does not know, I can most likely look it up on one of my devices that has the internet 
2322	If we were to introduce the new FACS technology, it may have unindended lasting impacts which could be detrimental to our society. 
2323	The first reason that it could be bad for our society as a whole is that it is not the computer's duty to explain how to do everything and to change to our will. 
2324	"While computers were made to help us, it cannot be our only source of information. On the other hand, teachers are st school for the sole purpose of helping you learn. It is their actual job to be there to help you learn things. While computers are a tool to help achieve this goal, there are other ways to learn about things and get them explained to you.  When you are in highschool, many teachers and parents will say things to you along the lines of ""In the real world"" and "" Highschool is preparing you for the real world"". Later on in life, ""in the real world"", if you get bored at a job you cannot just change what you are doing. You have to continue on with it because it is your job. If we implemented this system now in schools, many kids and teens would get in their mindset that if they are bored or don't understand something, things will change for them. Kids should not rely on a computer to help them understand everything. There are teachers, classmates, parents, and other adults who can help. "
2325	Not every school has computers and not every class uses them. If we were to implement this software, it could be giving an unfair advantage to the students who had acsess to it. There are still plenty of schools that may not have a computer in every classroom. Similarly, not all students and parents can afford this kind of technology. Because of how new and high-tech this software is it most likely will cost more money to be put into effect. This would cause the schools with more money to be able to get it while the schools with less funding and less money to be pushed aside and not get it. This causes the students at the schools that cannnot afford it to have a disadvantage. 
2326	The third and final reason why this could be bad for our society as a whole is simply that people may become less sensitive to reading other peoples emotions. 
2327	Without needing to have face- to- face human interactions to see how people are feeling, it could result in a decline of being able to recognize emotions in facial expressions.  I learned a few chords on the ukulele this summer. I could piece together a song or two. Now after a few months, I can't remember the first thing about playing those chords. This example shows that if you learn something then don't do it for an extended period of time, it will take a while to relearn how to do it. Although reading emotions is nothing like playing ukulele, the same holds true; if you learn something, and rely on something else to help you do it, it is going to be hard for you to re-learn how to do it again. 
2328	People also have a right to privacy and some people may not enjoy those particular rights being breached. 
2329	Because it is not the computers duty to exlain everything to you, not everyone has accsess to this kind of software, and people may lose their sensitivity to the fine art of emotion reading, I am in opposition of implementing this FACS technology. 
2330	In today's world, everyone is on their phones. The second you wake up you check your phone. It has just become part of our daily life, that is why it is so important to spend time off of a screen, to do something you have a passion for. 
2331	The Facial Action Coding System is an unnecesscary piece of equipment. The software that would be able to detect the emotions of an individual would have several negative affects on society. The reading of emotions is a useful tool when it is detected by someone's natural instinct, but it would not be helpful to only have an understanding on someone's emotions due to the results given on a screen. 
2332	The Facial Action Coding System is not a valuable to students 
2333	because it would decrease the rate at which students learn 
2334	identifying someone's emotions will not change how they are feeling 
2335	and it would decrease their motivation for work in the future.  
2336	The ability for this device to detect the emotions of a student while they are working would be detrimental to the health and responsibilty of the student. 
2337	"The author states that the machines will ""recognize when the student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective intructor"" (D'Alto 6). This would be harmful to the students determination to learn. It would also cause several students to fall behind in their education. Every student experiences boredom in class, but the teacher is unable to change the lesson everytime to best fit one individual student because the other children will fall behind. Students are still capable of learning material when they are bored even if it is not as effectively as when they are interested. Students need to also learn how to work through their emotions to better their ability to improve. When these students get into the work field, they can not call in sick or slack off every time they experience a negative emotion. This device would be teaching children that they should only be productive if they are intrigued by their task. This would not be a proper lesson to teach growing individiuals. "
2338	The technology is able to identfy a human's true emotions, but that will not alter the way that person feels. 
2339	"Humans can often acknowledge how they are feeling, but the acknowledgement itself does not allow them to feel better. As stated in the article, ""They even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one"" (D'Alto 7). This line states that the lab partner will be able to tell a difference netween a genuine and meaningful smile from a harshly forced smile. There is a difference between the two because smiling will not make you happy although it is a happy gesture. The machine informing someone that they need to smile will not actually change the emotions of that person. Politicians and celebrities are major culprits of this action. They often smile as they are told to do, but they are not always genuine. They are typically hiding something from their spectators such as when they are not being truthful (D'Alto 8). Just because famous people smile when talking or looking at their audience does not change whether or not they are happy individuals. If humans themselves are unable to change their emotions when they can detect that something is wrong, then machines will be unable to do that also. Although it can give people a precise measurement of their emotions, it will not change how they feel. Therefore, investing in this system would be extremely useless and wasteful. "
2340	The technology that recognizes emotions in order to change the student potential will decrease their motivation. 
2341	"The skill to be compable of working through tough situations is essential to posess. Modifying a students' workload would harm their motivation. These students will no longer be motivation to be their most effective because they will expect everything in life to be modified to their liking. Unfortunately, this is not a trait that can be successfully transferred to real world issues. Therefore, these students will be less prepared for potential problems they may encounter. This system would also decrease the dependence on human connection. The text states that computers need to understand emotional communications because ""most human connection is nonverbal"" (D'Alto 6). "
2342	Although that statement is true, 
2343	there is little use for computers undertsanding how humans feel if they can not help the individual with their emotons. 
2344	This may cause people to reply more on the machines, which would lessen the amount of human connection that exists--much like previous technology advances have done. Human connection is essential to a striving population, therefore it will have negative affect on society. 
2345	The Facial Action Coding Sytem would be wasteful to the society, and would cause several negative effects. It is not something worth investing in because it would harm the developing youth. Not only do these machines prove useless to emotions of people, but it will also decrease the motivation of students and future employees. 
2346	people save money, 
2347	the air isn't being poluted as much 
2348	there aren't as many traffic jams. 
2349	"To further explain, Bogota, Columbia has a program in which people do not use vehicles to get where they need to go. Andrew Selsky states, ""...millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses to work during a car-free day.. leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams."" It's a positive thing to have ""car-free day"" because less accidents mean less people getting injured. "
2350	limiting car usage is not only good for people, but it can be positive toward the earth and environment as well because it saves people money, the air is healthier and people have less of a chance of crashing. 
2351	"Kobe Bryant is known for his signature jump shot, the Fade-away. It's unique, it's effective, and it's his style. In the classroom, every student dreads the word ""project"". Projects are meant to test comprehension on a given topic. The problem with teacher-designed projects is that they are boring and predictable. The teacher-designed projects also have specific guidelines, which doesn't allow students to expand their thinking and express their knowledge in a way they would like to. "
2352	Lamar Jackson and LeBron James strive in their respective sports for one reason, their style. If every athlete were to shoot the basketball the same way, or throw the football the same way, then there would be no point in watching the games! These sporting events are exciting because every athlete has their own style of play. The same could be said in the classroom. If every student in a class presented a slide show or an essay for their project, I bet the teacher would fall asleep in an instant! 
2353	Student-designed projects gives the opportunity for the students to really show their creativity and understanding in a way that is special to them. 
2354	Imagine sitting through a class where every single student presented with a slide show; It's so simple that a baby could make the same project. Teacher-designed projects don't give the opportunity for students to really show how well they understand the topic. Repetition in the classroom is very toxic. Having the same boring project guideline for every student doesn't engage the students in any way at all. The student-designed projects show diversity and creativity; on the other hand, teacher-designed projects are extremely dull and unoriginal. The teacher-designed projects have such a strict rubric that makes the students roll their eyes. The biggest flaw of it all is that the students are only trying to satisfy the teacher, rather than trying to fully comprehend the subject. 
2355	When someone is passionate about anything, they give it their all. When I'm on the lacrosse field, I give my 100% every time I step on the turf. Passion in life forces the best result in any moment. If students were able to lead their own project, then an astonishing grade would be guaranteed. Kobe Bryant is one of the basketball players because of his passion for the game and the amount of work he puts in to get better. 
2356	In the classroom, students would put in a tremendous amount of effort if they were given the chance to do a project in their own way. 
2357	The way Carlos Santana strums a guitar is iconic and infamous; no other living creature can imitate his style. In the classroom, an assignment is ruined when the students don't get to show their creativity and way of thinking. Teacher-designed projects make students think inside the box, and they are trapped with a specific set of rules that they cannot pass. Projects are meant to test the student on their knowledge on the subject, but most students only do the project for a passing grade and not for their own comprehension. Summer school projects should be student-designed because the students are able to form something in their own style, they would put in effort into something they are passionate about, and the teacher-designed projects are plain and disgusting. A teacher-designed project is a vanilla ice cream cone, while a student-designed project is an ice cream cone with nuts, chocolate syrup, and a cherry on top.  
2358	In 1976, the Viking 1 spacecraft was orbiting the planet of Mars, and it was taking new pictures for all of mankind to see. As it was passing over a strip of Mars called Cydonia, it snapped a picture that would cause an uproar in space exploration. This new picture showed what seemed to be a human face. A few days later NASA reveled these pictures for the world to see; it was an instant hit 
2359	Conspiracy theorist were fast to make speculations that this was ancient alien architecture or something of the sort. But NASA said that the face was just a geograghical coincidence, and there is no alien stucture on Mars. 
2360	One reason that consiracy theorist could beleive that this could be an alien stucture is that the resolution of the first picture was very low. 
2361	"n paragraph 10 it says,"" ...43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" This shows that the photo didn't give very compelling evidence that there was life on Mars. soon later NASA and their supporters claimed that this face is just an act of nature is because of the 1998 Global Surveyor spacecraft. This new spaceship passed over the red planet to take pictures of the ""face on Mars"". The pictures were ten times better than the last pictures of Cydonia this time. The new photos clearly showed a landform on Mars and not a man. "
2362	"The day the photo was taken was in winter. It says in paragraph 8 that, "" ... it was winter in April '98- a cloudy time of year on the Red Planet."" These facts show that the landmass could indead be hidden by clouds. However, NASA still supported their claim that it was just a misinterpreted natural landform. "
2363	While NASA never spoke negatively about the theory, they set out again to prove it wrong. on April 8, 2001, the Mars Global Surveyor came over the face on Mars, and it took photos with a resolution of 1.56 meters per pixel; the highest ever yet. What these pictures showed was what would be a butte or a mesa on Earth. These landforms are very common in Cydonia, so the pictures were very realistic. 
2364	"With very high resolutioned photos, it is hard for conspiracy theorists to still say that there is face on Mars. It even says in paragraph 11,"" So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" "
2365	teachers know what the students need to learn over the summer, 
2366	have experience with assignment composition, 
2367	make the assignments challenging rather than easy. 
2368	Teachers are the people who give their students the knowledge to be successful. They go to college to gain the knowledge about their interests. Often, they are passionate enough to share their interest by teaching. Therefore, the most skilled person in the classroom is the teacher, because of their knowledge about the subject. I don't know enough about my school subjects to teach them, because I'm still in the process of learning them. 
2369	Teachers understand the format that works best with their students, something the students don't know enough about. Teachers can create a worksheet or document that is created to help students learn. Even younger teachers can create well composed projects because they had college classes to develop teaching skills. Older teachers have so much experience that they can craft an assignment with ease. I could not make an assignment for other students, because I lack the necessary experience to create expertly composed documents that teachers design to be efficient learning materials for the summer. 
2370	In order to develop a student's brain, teachers will challenge them with harder material to complete. More often than not, students aren't academically active over summer break leading to poor performance. Teachers don't want their students to forget everything they've learned in the previous year. If teachers made easier summer projects, then all the students would not be prepared for school. 
2371	Since teachers know the material they need to give students, have knowledge in project composition, and make challenges for the students, they should be constructing the summer assignments. They are the best fit for the role of educating and summer assignments are how students learn without the teacher. Teachers, creating the assignment, put their knowledge and experience into the assignment. Students do not have knowledge and experience teaching. With that said, students should be an input for education, while teachers continue to be an output for it. This would fulfill the roles of student and teachers leaving each to what they're best at. 
2372	After school activities might take away some free time that you may have at home, about almost the whole world does something after school as to sports, getting a job, and much more. 
2373	Sometimes people are busy all the time, like, people that do sports after school, some of them don't get out of there sports practice or games after sometime, mostly around 9:00pm. Personally, people are great for doing after school activities, but I'm not one of those people, and I will never be, unless its something with basketball, or an activity that I'd want to do on my free time, but it usually waists a lot of free time, and I'm one of those people that like to do homework, especially since I get a lot of it. So what I'm trying to say is, we have a life too, were not always just on our technology 24/7, were actually trying to do things that are good for us. 
2374	Photographers job is to take pictures, and put it into a book, or a frame for people. Yearbook photographers take pictures, but what you don't know is, that they have to help the year book makers, and helpers to put those pictures into the yearbook, and the worst thing is, that they might not have enough people, some might be sick, or some might just not have enough time, and that can be bad sometimes. Lets say your a year book photographer, and your taking pictures, and your friend is sick, then you realize that you have to go through all the pictures you took, and pick which one is best, or which one seems yearbook appropriate. After you go through the pictures you then realize that all your friends in the yearbook photographer club are all either on vacation, or sick, so your alone, and you need the pictures to be in the year book by tomorrow, but you have no access to internet, because your friends are the ones that have the internet, and can turn in the pictures, then once everyone thought that they would get there yearbooks, they didn't, because all of one day and the day you needed your friends to be there. Let me tell you that, that is stressful, because some people could blame you, but it was never your fault. If this were me I would be so mad, because I would know I would get blamed on. So, being in an after school activity can be stressful especially in one you know your gonna have a hard time in. 
2375	and I agree, students usually at middle school should try and sign up for something that will benefit for them like, sports and maybe some extra lessons to keep up their grade up, or try out and be ahead of everyone else, now while that may seem bad its really not, because it's there choice if they want to take geometry one year and take algebra 2 in the summer, or after school everyday. They'll be on their way to getting a good job or even be being the next Albert Einstein, who knows? 
2376	By carefully examining the text and pondering their ideas of the planets surface and difficuties of gaining access to venus , one could definitely say that yes, the author does support their idea very well. But this is a planet that can crush submarines like soda cans. 
2377	The conflict of whether or not scientists should study the planet Venus has been up in the air, no pun intended, for sometime now. Many individuals think that studying Venus up close is too dangerous, whereas others disagree and think risks should be made. 
2378	"In the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author thinks studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers, but does not support this idea very well. "
2379	The author describes the potential dangers that could result from studying Venus which contradicts their idea that the observations made through studying Venus overweigh the risks. 
2380	"The author is aware of the fact and describes how, ""no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours"" (paragraph 2). Right off the bat, the author gives their audience the mindset that it is not a good idea to study Venus. Having that fact in the first few paragraphs of the article sets the tone for the rest of the article. In paragraph three, the author goes into great detail about several of the potential dangers that can come from studying Venus because of its, ""clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid"" (paragraph 3). The frightening environment described strays the audience even further away from believing that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers "
2381	"including the fact that, ""such an environment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans"" (paragraph 3). At this point in the article, the idea of having a human explore and study Venus up close in unthinkable. "
2382	"The author describes, ""a vehicle hovering over Venus"" (paragraph 5). At first, the technological advances that could be made sound like a good idea, but the author goes on to say how, ""tempertaures would still be toasty at around 170 degress Fahrenheit"" (paragraph 5). This fact completely shuts down the idea of the hovering vehicle. The author contradicts their ideas by explaining the dangers in depth and giving reason as to why studying Venus is not a good idea. "
2383	From the very first descriptions of the idea the author is trying to bring across, the audience is turned away from the author's opinion. The tone set sways the audience toward one direction of the conflict while the author is in the other direction. The author went too far into detail about the dangers that can come from studying Venus and di not have evidence of how it would be safe and possible at all. The author's idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers was not supported through their ideas or evidence.         
2384	"Studying Venus seems almost impossible with all the risks, but the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" suggests that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite all the dangers it presents. "
2385	The author certainly proves their idea on why they think studying the planet Venus is worth it. The author supports their idea by making sure to back it up with evidence. 
2386	"In ""The challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author supports their idea well by explaining Venus's relationship with Earth, "
2387	First, the author uses Venus's relationship to our own planet, Earth, to support their ideas. 
2388	"For instance, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth"" (4). The excerpt above illistrates some of the similar features Venus has to Earth. The author uses the similarities of the planets to support their idea of venus being a worthy pursuit. "
2389	"The text also states, ""Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel"" (4). The author uses this sentence to support their idea by explaining how Venus is one of the nearest options to Earth for space travel. Saving travel time is one way Venus shows it is a worthy pursuit. Overall, the author uses the relationship the planets Earth and Venus have with eachother to support their thoughts. "
2390	Secondly, the author uses the point of human curiosity to support the idea that Venus is a worthy pursuit. 
2391	"To illistrate, ""...human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors"" (8). The author explains how humans are naturally curious, and how this curiosity often times leads them to dangerous situations. Studying Venus has its dangers, but it is no different. Also stated, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation"" (8). The author is promoting curiosity because it leads us to new things. Curiosity can overcome the fear of danger when exploring Venus to help us learn new things about the planet. To summarize, the power of curiosity in people is something the author uses to support their opinion of Venus being worth it to explore. "
2392	Additionally, the author uses evidence about how landing on Venus is possible to support their idea that it is a worthy pursuit. 
2393	"For example, ""At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Farenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth"" (5). The author uses this piece of evidence to demonstrate that Venus's conditions are possible for humans to survive, making Venus a serious contendor for space exploration. "
2394	"The author also states, ""Some simplified electronics... have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions"" (7). The author backs up her idea by using these electronics, that can survive three weeks on venus, to once again show that we can get through to venus. Science and technology being able to help us properly function on Venus shows that the planet is a worthy pursuit. Ultimately, the author backs up her idea by giving evidence on the different ways landing on Venus is possible. "
2395	"In conclusion, the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" demonstrates how despite the dangers Venus presents, it is worthy of pursuing. Exploring venus seems like it is almost impossible with all the risks it offers, but the author makes it clear in this article that they disagree. Their use of evidence in their writing to support their belief that Venus is a worthy pursuit shows how well researched their case is. The author used evidence on Venus's relationship to Earth, how landing on Venus is possible, and the natural curiosity humans have to support their idea. After taking a look at this article, readers know that the points made in ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" were very nicely supported. The author's support made their idea a thought provoking case. "
2396	"In a school, there are clasrooms upon classrooms that are all teaching different, new, and exciting classes. When walking down a hallway, it is more than possible that the sounds of logorithmic functions could be taught to your left as Shakespeare might be being recited to your right. If you take a turn, one kid may be leaving his photography class to go take pictures for the yearbook while another may be returning from the restroom to go back to her chemistry class where she is studying saturated and unstaurated solutions. Despite the intense differences and varities of classes that there are at a high school, not every one of them is ""new"", ""different"", and ""exciting,"" as used previously to describe the classrooms scenes to all kids. Therefore, if it were at all possible that these kids could feel and want to be more engaged in their classes that take up a large portion of their week and youth, the way to do so should be evident in the classrooms. "
2397	With this in mind, the idea that using Facial Action Coding Systems in classrooms would be valuable is not only true, but something that should be acted upon. (D'Alto). 
2398	"In the text, the excerpt, ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming cofused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts,"" shows that student's attention could be analyazed. (D'Alto, 6). With this being done, if the computer would be able to recgonize confusion, the student could then be introduced to a better way to learn the material or a way that they beter understand it, then leading to better grades. (D'Alto, 6). Also, the grades of the students could improve based on what the computer decides to do with as much human touch as it can. The passage, ""'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor,'"" shows that there is a solution to any problems a kid may have with what they are learning. (D'Alto 6). The fact that the computer attempts to try and help the students with a human touch shows that it would have the capibilties to do it's best and help the students to learn better, overall improving the student's grades. (D'Alto 6). With both of these examples in mind, it can be seen that the inclusion of this sytem into classrooms would have the capability to improve both a student's grades and understanding. "
2399	When a kid is sitting in a classroom for an hour, atleast, every day to every other day, there is seemable reason as to why and how a kid could get easily side tracked and/or bored. Despite this being true, the inclusion of this program into student's lives may have the ability to greatly improve student's engagement and interest in the classroom. 
2400	"In this article, the author includes, ""'Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional connection,' notes Dr. Huang. 'So computers need to understand that, too,'"" shows just how the students may become more engaged and interested in their classes that take up so much of their week days. (D'Alto 6). If the computers would be able to connect with the students, there is no reason that these kids would not feel more obligatred to pay attention and more interested to learn what is being taught. (D'Alto 6). Another reason that these kids would gain more by having this system in their schools is the idea that would engage them in a fun manner. When the author included, ""The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can really do,"" the reason is stated so in the text. (D'Alto 6). By including this piece, the author is showing that there, overall, is a fun factor to this could intrigue the students and keep them interested in their assignments and school overall. With these two ideas in mind, it can be seen that, as the attention of students is a primary need for schools, if this could improve just that, there is no reason not to include it in student's lives. "
2401	As science is an ever-budding field by it's own nature, there is no reason that a new technology wouldn't thrive among those interested in both science and technology. 
2402	Therefore, as this is something that is new and up and coming, the addition of this to clasrooms may spark a pasion for this subject and inspire a career to form. 
2403	"In the excerpt, ""The software is the latest innovation from Prof. Thomas Huang, of the Beckham Institute for Advanvced Science at the University of Illinois, working in collaboration with Prof. Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam,"" shows just how recent this technology is. (D'Alto 1). With this in mind, if students were able to be introduced and subject to this technology, there could be future scientist that want to further improve this technology and, until then, would be more involved in it's place at school. (D'Alto 1). Also, due to the fact that this technology is not only limited to the classroom, it is then evident that other jobs could be produced out of this technology being in the classroom, sparking interest in young and vulnerable students. As the author includes, ""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive--for video games or video surgery,"" it is showsn just exactly how various the fields are that this technology could be used in. (D'Alto 6). Whether a kid is devoted to learning about medicne or engrossed in playing games, it has been shown that this technology in the classrooms would expose these kids to it's capabilities and potentially create a passion. (D'Alto 6). Therefore, by including this technolgy in the classroom with it's own purpose, the students would be subject to technolgy that is blooming in several fields and could easily inspire a child to become something that utilizes this technology in their future. "
2404	As kids are ever-subject to new and upcoming ideas, it is evident that the addition of recent techology could aid their progression in school and would be deemed as important and valuable to include. If a kid were someone that easily lost interest in a course or was not very interested in a certain class, they may then be more provoked to learn and pay attention if this new technology was included at their school and interested them. By doing so, there is potential that the student would then be able to improve their grade and get much out of this porgram. Also, if a student were to be even intrigued in this technology, there could be potential for this studen to go into a job field that dealt with this type of technology as there are many that vary greatly in doing so. Overall, the inclusion of present innovations and technology should be including the next generations, as success for them now will lead to future success for all. 
2405	Summer is a great way to take a break from school, but also to apply knowledge to the real world. In some areas, students are required to complete summer projects to ensure they continue to learn over their break. These projects are usually designed by the teachers, who want their students to be as prepared as possible for what they will learn in the fall. However, some argue that summer projects should be designed by students, as they can create engaging ways to educate themselves. This can better prepare students for the ways they will apply what they learned in school in the real world. 
2406	they can create projects they want to complete, 
2407	they can incorporate their real-world knowledge and experience, 
2408	they can design a project they know will be possible for them to complete. 
2409	Despite the benefits of student-designed projects, those who favor ones designed by teachers point to the fact that teachers can base projects off the curriculum students will have to learn during the school year and thus help students feel more prepared. 
2410	However, students who design these summer projects can easily be given a description of the required curriculum to guide them while they design their projects. This will allow them to find ways they can incorporate the material into an achievable project. 
2411	Thus, it is possible for students to create a project that addresses important parts of the material they will learn 
2412	Students who are able to design their own projects can create projects they are interested in completing, leading to a more engaging learning experience. 
2413	When asked to complete a project they are interested in, students are more likely to complete the assignment and be enthusiastic about what they learn in the process. This elevated engagement presents itself in increased academic achievement, including higher scores on standardized tests, and better retention of material, instead of forgetting it as they continue on their academic path. This level of engagement and the associated benefits is lacking in teacher-designed projects because they do not cater to the interests of the students. These projects miss out on the benefits found in student-designed projects. Thus, while teacher-designed projects may share short-term benefits such as better understanding of the material, they do not maintain the long-term retention necessary for later successes such as boosted standardized test scores. When students design the projects, they are able to create a more engaging experience that leads to better learning. 
2414	Students are able to incorporate their knowledge and experience into projects they design, whereas teachers might assign one that they are unfamiliar with. 
2415	Teachers do not know the experiences of the students they are designing projects for, so they may create one that students struggle applying their real-world knowledge to or one that only focuses on the curriculum instead of ways the learning material can be applied to life outside of school. Students can find creative ways to link what they learn in school to its applications in the real world. This better prepares students for their future lives and careers, where they will be applying what they learned in school instead of being continually tested on it. These students are more prepared for what they will be doing after they finish their education because of this prior experience in applying their knowledge and experience. This also reminds students that there is a world outside of school, creating worldly citizens who are able to apply what they learned to solving problems. 
2416	Students can be assured that they will have a project that they can complete when they design their own project, instead of one that may be too challenging or that they might not have the resources to complete. 
2417	Teachers who are unfamiliar with the students and their circumstances may overestimate the students and create a project that is too difficult for students to complete on their own. They might also design a project that students do not have the ability to complete-if a teacher were to assign an essay on what a student learned by traveling, a low-income student may not be able to do it if their family cannot afford to travel. Students are more familiar with their own abilities and resources and can create a project that will provide a good challenge while not being too confusing or difficult. Reaching out for assistance would also be easier, as confused students could reach out to their peers instead of a teacher they do not know. Teachers are prone to creating a project that may be difficult or impossible to students they are unfamiliar with, but students are able to design ones based on their own abilities and resources. 
2418	Students should design summer learning projects because they can create more interesting ways to learn, they can design ways to incorporate their real-world experiences to the academic curriculum, and they can make a project that will not be too difficult for them to complete over summer break. Students can design more engaging projects based on their interests that will ultimately increase benefits such as higher standardized tests scores and retention of material. Their ability to design projects that incorporate the curriculum into the real world will better prepare them for life and work after they complete their education. In school districts where summer projects are used, parents should advocate for student-designed projects to better their children's education. 
2419	Being exposed to this type of activity from a young age will ensure your success in later years. 
2420	Playing a sport teaches you resilience, and how to work with a team. 
2421	Loosing a sports game does not feel good but its something every one has experienced. Although not everyone knows how to handle losing. When you are taught from a young age how to be resilient and bounce back from a lose, it will be much easier to handle those losses as an adult. Playing a sport also requires team work, you have to work with your team to score a goal. Learning how to communicate with your team mates is very similar to communication in the work place. 
2422	Being on the student council is all about communicating with your peers. 
2423	Debate teaches students how to argue respectfully while still getting your point across. 
2424	School offering a variety of mandatory extracurricular actives is a great idea. This way students can learn important life lessons while doing something they enjoy. These actives teach children important lessons from knowing how to handle losing, communication with others, and even how to respectfully settle an argument. Being exposed to this type of activity from a young age will ensure great success in later years of life. 
2425	Recently the principle made a big change to our school. He decided that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity. After I heard about this, I started thinking of how this can impact our school. Some students might disagree with this new change, but I actually agree with the principle's decision. There might be some minor ways on how this can effect students, however, I think this could be a great way to improve students mental health. 
2426	this could make students more productive, 
2427	help students find something they might be passionate in, 
2428	have a great way to make new friends. 
2429	There are many students who can get lazy when they come home from school. Most of the time, I can be one of those students. Usually when I come home after school, I always get the urge to jump on my bed and just watch videos on my phone. When I get on my phone, I can get so invested in it, that I don't even realize I have a lot of homework assignments to do.  Being lazy is just unhealthy for your body and mental health. Most students probably have been in the same situation as me. Although, if those students were to be in a extracurricular activity, they would be more productive. For example, an activity like playing soccer can help someone's brain/and body to be more active. Another example would be participating in any art-related activity, which can help students think more creatively. Doing any extracurricular activity would be way better than to sit down and watch on a device. 
2430	Socializing and making friends is important for anyone's mental health. Friends can be supporting and a helping hand at any time. The friends you make can also build a strong character in you. If you join an extracurricular activity that you really like, it can be easier to make friends because they will have the same interest as you. Because of the similar interests, the friends you make through an activity can be more closer than the friends you make in class. Making friends gets you to know other people in your school, and it's better to know more people so you can feel more comfortable at school. 
2431	As the end of the school year approaches, I began to grow with excitement. Finally, I have a break from the stressful school work. However, as I thought I would be free from the chains, I am held back once again as teachers began to assign tedious summer project. Tired and with my strong desires of a break, I waited till the last couple weeks of summer before starting on the time consuming project. Recently, an argument has risen about whether summer projects should be student deigned or teacher designed. People who believe that the projects should be student designed may argue that student designed projects would increase the percentage of participation on these projects. Others, who believed that it should be teacher designed, argue back that the knowledge teachers have on the curriculum allows the projects to be truly designed for its main intention 
2432	their knowledge of the future curriculum 
2433	their understanding of the mindset of students 
2434	Teachers are well equipped with the knowledge of the future curriculum, thus they have the ability to adjust their lesson plans to help assist their students for the upcoming years. 
2435	Seen by many students, lessons or skills learned in the previous school year are used in the present school year. For example, math facts, such as addition and subtraction, are constantly being referred to in all math courses. Acknowledging this reality, teachers would try to shift their lesson plans around for the purpose of trying to strengthen their students ability to understand such skills. Similar theory is applied to the designing of summer projects. Teachers, with the knowledge of what is expected in the next couple courses of a students life, would be able to shape projects into helping the students prepare for the upcoming school year. 
2436	People who believed that the summer projects should be student designed may argue that student designed projects will encourage for more participation, due to the fact that these projects will have a more simple design and be more easier to understand. 
2437	However, lowering the difficulty of a project doesn't cause a dramatic shift in student participation. As seen in several classrooms, in regards to homework, regardless of the difficulty in the assignment, many student willingly choose to not complete their assignment. Therefore, attendance or participation is an irrelevant factor when designing these projects. 
2438	Having a easier summer project not only doesn't shift the percentage of participation, but also causes a strain in the development or knowledge of the student over the summer. 
2439	Summer projects should be designed by teachers because teachers have understanding about future curriculum and understanding about the actions of a typical student. One of the main goals of a teacher is to assist students or help students succeed in life. Therefore, logically, everything a teacher does is to benefit the students. Teachers, unbiased about the emotions of a student, will challenge their students into achieving high goals. In their best efforts, teachers would try to assist their students in trying to acquire beneficial skills. Teachers understand that some students will try to challenge authority by refusing to complete assignment, instead of signing in defeat, they will persistent in their teaching methods because they understand that defeat wouldn't help the student. Thus, teachers should have the opportunity to design summer projects because they are guaranteed to have design projects that benefit students. Many successful businessmen, doctors, or scientists, credit their success to teachers. The profession of teachers have existed for many generations and have been known as the source of many successful people's success. Therefore, their ability to create a summer project should not be questioned.                  
2440	If a principal made every student engage in an extracurricular activity, I would disagree. I do not think students should be forced to do certain activities 
2441	they may not have the money to participate, 
2442	they may be shy and performing in a sport or club is out of their comfort zone, 
2443	they may not have enough time. 
2444	If you are involved in sports there are many expenses that come with the honor. You have to buy the right shoes and clothes to practice in, but that's not all. Getting training lessons for the activity can be very expensive and a hard task to achieve. Also, their parents might want to use the money for other things that are important to them like a family vacation, or eating out. Lastly, they may be participating in an activity out of school that is expensive, and having to pay for both a school activity, and after school activity can be difficult. 
2445	Some parents work late so finding a ride home or getting everything prepared for the activity can be hard. Also, a lot of students work on homework after school, if they played a sport or participated in a club, they may not have enough time to accomplish their studies, which in my opinion is the most important task of all. Students may not manage their time wisely. Finishing homework, participating in an activity, and still having a little free time at the end of the day is a lot to juggle. Without unlimited time on your hands, he or she may feel overwhelmed and stressed, which can lead to bigger problems. 
2446	although I would respect the principal's ultimate decision, I disagree with her statement. Students should not have to be involved in an extracurricular activity. They should be able to choose if they want to participate in an activity. Ultimately, the students choice should be prioritized, because they know their own strengths, and there are a couple reasons to support my claim. The student may not have the money to do so, it may be out of their comfort zone, and lastly they may not have enough time, and forcing them to participate in an activity would bring stress onto their shoulders.         
2447	Teacher may want to have them design them because they think students would make it extremely easy which is fair. 
2448	I still believe that students should be the ones to design it. 
2449	they need to be independent 
2450	People have to know when to take a break. Students throughout the school year have been taught many things by teachers which we are very grateful for. 
2451	we have been given hundreds of assignments and projects all made by different teachers. So instead of stressing during the long break they can finish the project at their own pace and even have fun with what they designed. 
2452	Let them grow up. 
2453	After each year of school is over they go onto the next, and during the summer they should be challenged with a self designed project to help them be more independent. 
2454	Teachers are more experienced. With people that think that teachers are the best option for designing the project I do understand why. Students are young and may just want to take the easy route by not putting much effort into it. 
2455	While teachers have experience making projects and understand just how hard each component will make it. So using a middle ground will help teachers let their kids be independent. By letting the teachers give students a guideline on what exactly the project should or should not have, will let them feel secure about them finishing it. 
2456	The guideline would explain the things needed for it and how it should be graded, and letting students know how it will be graded will help immensely when design it.  It will also help the students to figure out ideas for their design instead of them just being completely out in the open. So making a guild line will make both the teacher and students feel more secure and confident in the project being designed and completed.  
2457	Schools have to understand students better. With summer based projects being designed by the students they are able to have some fun doing it while also learning skills that are needed for both in school and out. Doing so helps them learn how to be independent and makes it so teachers will let them as well. So I do think that summer projects should be made by the students, because it helps them to learn independence, know when to take a break, and then let teachers know that they can do it but a little help at the start doesn't hurt.  
2458	students will understand the project better, 
2459	they will actually want to do it, 
2460	it will be a more fun and creative way for the students to learn. 
2461	"Since it was designed by the students, they will have a better understanding of what needs to be done for the assignment. If it was designed by a teacher, then the students may be confused about the assignment and will ask many questions. Students will also actually want to get it done. Since it was designed by the students, they will feel the need to get it done knowing its not just a burden put on them over the summer by the teacher, forcing them to work. Students will also not be able to use the excuse  ""I did not know what to do."" Students will know what to do because it was designed by the students in the first place. This is what leads me to believe that summer assignments should be student designed, because students will have a better understanding of the project since it was created by them. "
2462	If the assignment is designed by the students, it will appeal to them and they would take interest in it. If it was designed by a teacher, students will feel as if they have no choice in the matter, and must do as the teacher asks, thus removing the students interest from the assignment. Students will not feel as if they are having their summer taken away from them by the teacher, forcing them to do assignments. Since it was designed by the students, they would understand each other and know how much work would be too much, and what topics would appeal to them. This is why summer assignments should be student designed, because the students will actually want to get it done knowing they aren't being forced to do a project by the teacher. 
2463	They will enjoy doing the project because it appeals to them. Since it was designed by the students, they will find joy in doing it because it was created by them in the first place and wont feel as if they are being forced to do it by the teacher. Students will also understand that its not just another project designed by the teacher. Instead, its a fun and creative way to let the students have some fun while learning. They will be enthusiastic about the project because they know its not just a huge workload put on them by the teacher to ruin their summer. Students will also be able to ask their friends for help if needed, instead of having to ask the teacher how to do everything. This is why I strongly believe that summer assignments should be student-designed, because it will be a more fun and creative way for the students to learn and it will be more appealing to them.  
2464	In the passage, the article states that a classroom computer could recognize a stuudent becoming confused or bored (Dr. Huang). After that, it could modify the lesson similar to what an effective human instructor could do 
2465	"In the article he writes "" Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere."" Again he is describing Venus to sound like an awful place, so why would you want to explore it. Another good claim he makes is that, ""since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours.""  Why would you go explore Venus in a space craft if all of them were destroyed. If it where me i would not want to explore Venus, the author has given me plenty of reasons not to. "
2466	"Throughout the story the author does list at least one benefit to exploring Venus. In the story he writes, "" it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."" Yes i can agree that would be a great reason to explore Venus, "
2467	but here are the downsides to that. Venus now is not like Earth, it is more like a destroyed Earth. 
2468	"The author writes "" on the planets surface tempatures average over 800 degrees fahrenheit."" You cant even walk on the surface without burning up, how is this like Earth? The author also mentions,"" Venus was probaly covered largely with oceans."" All those oceans that may have been their are gone now. Why would we explore a destroyed Earth? "
2469	In conclusion the author does not give many benefits to exploring Venus. All he really did was list the benefits to why we shouldnt explore Venus. In my personal opinion if i where a scientest and somone read me this i would not want to explore Venus. In the end i do not believe the author makes a good case to explore Venus. 
2470	Personal automobiles and cars have played a major role throughout the world since the invention of the car in World War 2. Cars have been a very successful invention and many people drive their own every day on their way to work, school or other places their feet cannot carry them. Though the car has fulfilled its duties in making the lives of humans easier, it has also contributed to many negative events. For example, car emissions get trapped in the atmosphere and cause living things to breathe in dirty air around them. 
2471	a revolutionary idea has been spreading around the world: using personal automobiles less. 
2472	by establishing an agreement to decrease car use, people have been said to be happier and stress-free. 
2473	"The continuing congestion and traffic jams that are among most areas of the world, create an enormous amount of stress for the people driving. Many develop road rage or irritability and are unhappy after suffering from a long ride home because of traffic. Some believe that cities should become more like Vauban, a community in Germany in which the citizens have given up their cars, because those who live there are not focused on driving and are pleased living in such a manner. Heidrun Walter, a mother who lives in Vauban, portrays her love for this car-free community when she states, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" (Rosenthal). By living in an area with little or no use of cars, the society becomes more cheerful and has less stress to cope with. In addition, with no cars people are forced to spend more of their time outside to get from one place to another. In Bogota, Colombia there is an annual car-free day, in which anyone who does use their car has to pay a fine. Many spend their day outside walking or riding their bikes to get around and believe that the car-free day is ""a good opportunity to take away stress..."" (Selsky). As they exercise more without cars and enjoy the great outdoors, they wear bright smiles on their faces and look at things with a positive attitude. "
2474	With a smaller amount of people using their personal vehicles, less gas emissions are becoming a part of the Earth's atmosphere. 
2475	"Humans breathe in the gases that are polluting the air and can become sick from it. The environment suffers from the dirty air and may not be able to sustain life if there is not a stop to the large amounts of pollutants being emitted into the air. In the United States, passenger cars are the cause of ""up to 50 percent"" of greenhouse gas emissions while in Europe they are ""responsible for 12 percent"" (Rosenthal). This means that the car use in the United States is ruining the air around us and assists greatly in creating a disgusting environment. In popular and global cities, pollution is even more noticeable and overwhelming. For example, in Paris smog has become an everlasting issue. The climate in the area contributes to the smog filling the air along with the use of cars: ""Cold nights and warm days caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions"" (Chicago Tribune). To reduce the smog in the area, an elaborate plan was taken into action. Cars with even license plates could not drive on certain days and cars with odd license plates could not drive on the other days. By doing this, the air in Paris cleared up dramtically. Therefore by promoting a system where car usage is not as common, the environment can become healthier and cleaner, which benefits the citizens of the Earth. "
2476	declining the use of cars creates an open attitude towards alternative transportation methods. 
2477	"Those who live in car-free communities discover new ways to reach the destinations they have reach throughout the day. Some will utilize their body and take advantage of nature by biking or walking from one place or another. Others might us public transportation or will car-pool with those who do own a car. As previously mentioned before, Colombia participates in a car free day, which means ""Colombians hiked, biked, skated or took buses"" to get where they needed to be (Selsky). Their use of other means of transportation on the day without cars, exemplifies that it is possible to live using other ways to get around. Some people are against the idea of using other transportation, but if they were to see the impact the alternatives have, they would be more accepting. These days many young people tend to get their license later by waiting until they reach their twenties, suggesting that they can live a happy life without relying on a personal automobile. Instead of using their own cars, they find other ways to get to work or school. These people become acclimated to organizing their lives ""around where they can walk or take public transportation or car-pool with friends"" (Rosenthal). Younger people who commit their lives to walking or public transportation, become aware of the fact that driving a machine that can negatively affect the world is not a necessity. Their awareness then can continue passing on to each generation and can ultimately prevent the excessive use of cars throughout the world. "
2478	a life without cars might be a life worth living since it contributes to a stress-free society, a healthy environment, and an acceptance of other means of transportation. By relying less on cars, people can eliminate the variety of negative impacts on the world. The Earth can become a happier, cleaner, and more accepting place with a dead engine.    
2479	Cell phone use should not be legal while driving, it causes many accidents even fatalities. Drivers become careless while driving when using cell phones. 
2480	Cell phones cause distractions while on the road. Drivers do not pay attention to the road, which causes accidents to happen. 
2481	Even the act of just dialing a cell phone can be dangerous. This increases the crash risk by 3 times. This is one of the worst distractions drivers can have, Due to the fact that you are not paying attention to the road. The driver's hands are not on the steering wheel which causes you to lose control of your car. This increases the accident risk highly. This is only one reason why cell phone use while driving should be illegal. 
2482	"This causes the same problems as just dialing a cell phone. Drivers are too busy focused on their screen to pay attention to the road. They are also too busy thinking about their responses and what to say to pay attention to other drivers on the road. Since it usually takes two hands to text, the drivers have no hands on the steering wheel. This distraction causes the most fatalities. This is according to a sign over I-355, which states, ""857 traffic accidents caused last year due to texting. This is just another reason cell phone use while driving should be illegal. "
2483	"even though those have been shown not to eliminate the risk of getting into an accident. ""Device makers and auto companies acknowledge the risks of multitasking behind the wheel, but they aggressively develop and market gadgets that cause distractions.  They acknowledge these things happen but they still market things that will cause distractions and increase accident risk. "
2484	Cell Phone use should be illegal while driving. The worst are texting and talking on the cellphone while driving. Both inhibit driver awareness and increase the risk of getting into an accident. Hands free devices do not eliminate the risk of getting into an accident; it's a horribly common misconception. Cell phone distractions on the road cause accidents. If Illinois outlawed cell phone use, more people's lives would be saved.   
2485	Many students dislike completing summer projects during their vacation time. After working hard in school, they look forward to relaxing and giving their brain a rest. It is vital that we do not mentally burnout, however, it is also important that we keep our brain somewhat active during summer break. This is why students are often given summer work. There are many different types of summer projects. Some projects are more traditional, being solely focused on reading and writing. On the contrary, some assignments are hands on, designed to test students' creativity. 
2486	some people may think that students would create less overwhelming assignments, 
2487	to ensure that students are truly challenging themselves, 
2488	not wasting their vacation time, 
2489	well prepared for class when school starts. 
2490	Some people believe that summer projects should be student-designed so that students are not overly stressed during their vacation time. 
2491	While this opinion is relevant, it is not a valid point because students will end up making their work too easy. 
2492	If tasks are too easy, then students will be damaging their success in the long run. Their work should be difficult and involve a deep level of thinking. Challenging work is more beneficial to students because throughout life they will face many complex problems. They need to develop problem-solving skills early so that they know how to persevere during tough times. A good example of ambitious perseverance can be seen in scientific experiments. One leading historical scientist was Albert Einstein. In order to discovery electricity, he needed to perform a great number of trials. At times he felt stressed, as if he would never reach his goal. However, eventually the lightning produced electricity, and he had introduced a concept that would impact everyday life forever. This portrays the significance of challenging yourself, being that challenges stimulate a stronger drive to succeed. It is often frustrating when students encounter difficult work from their teachers, but developing these problem-solving skills will immensely improve their future well-being.  
2493	"Psychologist Erik Erickson developed the eight significant psycho social stages that outline the common conflicts experienced throughout a lifetime. In his seventh stage, known as ""integrity vs. despair,"" he describes the adulthood stage when people look back on their life. Many adults in this stage scroll through their overall progress and accomplishments. They decide if they spent their time wisely and lived a fulfilling life. If they look back at life and conclude that it was spent efficiently, they experience a sense of integrity. On the other hand, if they feel as if they did not make the most of their time on earth, they develop a terrible feeling of despair. It is important that students, being at such a young age, recognize the value of time. Although everyone remembers the saying ""life is short,"" many people forget to practice what they preach. If students are given teacher-designed projects, this will ensure that they efficiently spend their time during summer break.  "
2494	"In other words, the work assigned will be less surprising because students have already completed projects from their teachers. In the novel, ""I Am Malala,"" Malala's father prepares her to be a successful public speaker. At first Malala was not very good at speaking in front of a big audience, but he worked with her everyday to build her knowledge and improve her skills. Eventually, she became one of the most influential activists ever to exist. She is able to address important topics, such as women's rights, in ways that she never could before. Through proper preparation, her weak public speaking turned into her greatest strength. This proves that goals are met when students can connect with their mentors. Students must be given the chance to build a relationship with their teachers. If summer projects are teacher-designed, this will allow students to email their teachers with questions about the assignments. This will not only generate a strong relationship, but it will also prepare students for the style of teaching they will soon face at school. "
2495	Summer projects should be teacher-designed in order to set up students for success in the long run. Everyone deserves a chance to succeed, and student-designed projects can harm this potential success. Even though some people think that students would create less stressful work, teachers should design summer projects to ensure that they are difficult enough, genuinely worth spending time on, and quality preparation for kids to thrive in class. It is important to be independent and take initiative, but it is more important to live a fulfilling life. 
2496	Students making the projects know what will help their peers learn throughout the summer, 
2497	they know what they have truly learned rather than what teachers assumed they have been taught by other teachers, 
2498	they have the opportunity to showcase their creativity and passions through the project they complete. 
2499	In order to be most successful, students should have authority to be creative and responsible for their summer projects. 
2500	Summer projects purpose is to continue the growth of your mind when you are out of the classroom for about 90 days. A lot can happen to adolescents over the summer, a lot of things that anyone who is not in the same phase of life can truly understand. Many teenagers find sanity with their peers and friends in this time frame of growing up. As seen and extensively studied by Erik Erikson, Erikson came to the consensus that when you are going through the school-age stage of life you begin to pull away from your parents and adults to find yourself and find your independence. In result, you grow more drawn to your friends and peers, due to them understanding the phase of development you are going through. The connection students have with each other is something that can not be matched by teachers. No matter the background or clique a student is in they all have one major characteristic in common that connects them, they are all students. Teachers have not been in school in years and they don't connect with the same things as this generation does. Teachers did not have the same technology, pop culture, or even the same societal standards as today students have. 
2501	"Throughout my school years, I find myself stressed and concerned every year when I receive a new teacher, after a long and carefree summer. The teachers have so much faith in their coworkers and the retention of the knowledge that according to them ""we should have learned in years past."" They begin to assign ""easy"" and ""refresher"" work that they assume we have been taught. The lack of communication between teachers is a hard burden on students due to their past teachers exclaiming that ""you do not need to worry about that, your teacher next year will teach you,"" and your present teachers thinking that you had already learned it in your past courses. As the student, you are left with the sense of delusion and dissatisfaction on why you lack this important skill and learning target. You struggle to understand basic fundamentals of learning and when you are assigned a project you begin to sweat the little gaps in your learning. Every student knows this feeling of remorse of being assigned a project on material you just havent been taught yet. Students who design the projects know what they and their peers have been taught and what they all lack because they have all endured the same classes and teachers. "
2502	The creativity of generation Z is outstanding and unique to modern day society. The opportunity for students to create the projects would be extraordinary and expressive of our generation. The use of creativity is very limited in school. You are to be complacent with the standards of your school through the strict rules and regulations they place. Many of the rules you are given are not only rigid but not needed. Teachers set boundaries on students and rarely let them experience and express their own style and flair. When students are allowed to indulge in their personal ambiance their limits are endless. This is embodied through art and the publishing of students in modern day. More books written by teenagers are selling on the shelves today, than ever before. 
2503	The teachers teach every student the same in order to maintain a consistency and basis of learning. 
2504	By doing this they lose the chance to see the passions and talents of the individual students. Consistent learning is needed but teachers lack the understanding that every student is different and have their own learning process and strengths. Modern day students recognize the differences throughout their peers and themselves. They notice that the differences unite them and it is ordinary to be different. Students who create the projects will implement the material to be expressive of their peers because they have the same mindset that comes with being in generation of identity and self-expression. Teachers do not see this aspect of learning they see learning targets and standards. 
2505	Student-designed projects would implement effective, continual learning over the summer break due to the students connection with their peers, knowledge of common learning gaps, and the generational need of creativity and self-expression. The purpose is to continue learning while not being in a classroom, but how can we continue to grow our knowledge if the students can not establish a connection with project due to being out-of-touch with modern day and the mentality of today' students. Therefore, in order to achieve maximum learning, students should be tasked with the project design.  
2506	*BAM* A loud sound cracks across the intersection as if a bomb just went off but in reality, it was the sound of a SUV running into the back of a man on a scooter because the driver of the SUV was on their cellphone. 
2507	Everyone in the car and in other vehicles are prone of getting hurt when a mind-altering device steers you away from the concentration you should have while driving. So many lives are taken or altered because of the simple decision to send or reply to one text message. If precautions are heavily enforced before adults and teens especially enter the car, then maybe this epidemic can become obsolete. Fines are enforced but how well is the question? Phones are the biggest distraction when you enter a car by far so this doesn't completely forget about alcohol or trying to change the radio station but technology has become so advanced that we have voice text and on a star. 
2508	If the message is that important phones should become voice-activated and only respond to your voice so we can still pay attention to the road and send out a text without removing our hands from the wheel. 
2509	Technology has also clutched us with Bluetooth if you need to stay in communication just use Bluetooth and make a phone call instead which is completely easier than sending a text anyway because its faster and you can get responses much quicker than you could with a text message. Reality is one text or call could wreck it all. 
2510	The U.S. Government should ban texting while driving in all fifty states NO QUESTIONS ASKED! 
2511	Visual distractions are a nuisance A visual distraction is anything that takes your eyes off the road. While driving we are constantly being side tracked by signs and advertisements we see all over the place from the newest restaurants opening, to the $100 billion Powerball billboards on the highway, the last thing you need to be doing is trying to reply to a text while paying attention to all of these catchy signs. And lastly, manual distractions which are any distractors causing you to take your hands off the wheel such as reaching for your phone to send that quick text. 
2512	What if your principal said that everyone would have to stay after school for and extra hour only to participate in a useless activity? How would you feel if someone where to interfere with your schedule? The school says that we must participate in an extracurricular activity. You might be wondering why the school would want us to participate in a club. The whole reason is because they think that it would shape our future, give us a learning experience, and make us want to learn something new. Although this is true, there are more downsides to this rule than you think 
2513	It is completely unfair to force students to partake in an activity. 
2514	One of the disadvantages in a required school activity is that people might not have enough time to do things they normally do. 
2515	If we take an extra course, there might not be enough time to finish all our homework. When I get home, I have a substantial amount of homework to do, and I have to practice the sports I play. My schedule is already full. homework takes me the longest to do. I work on my homework thoroughly. I try to make sure there isn't any mistakes. When I do this, I'm more likely to pass the test because of how much thought and time I have put into my work. I describe this as my work ethic. My homework takes me about two to four hours at most and it takes up most of my schedule. The sports that I play take two hours. With a total of seven hours at most, I can never seem to fit anything else in my schedule. This might be surprising for other people but this is the daily schedule for average students and most students might have more to do. If we even tried to do an extra activity than we wouldn't be able to finish all of our work efficiently and properly. Adding another thing to do every day would throw off our work ethic and our grades would most likely go down. Time has such a drastic effect on us students because it can be hard to manage. Our parents, for example, suffer from time management along with us. If we all do an extra activity, then that means that school is extended another few minutes. This is hard for our parents who pick us up after school. They have to find another time to pick us up which can be stressful since their schedule is as cramp as ours. We are not able to participate in an extra curriculum because of the amount of time that we don't have, and even if we were able to, there might not be any other options. 
2516	we students have to choose which activity we would like to do. Maybe you don't like any of the clubs or classes that are provided. Then they would have to choose a club that they do not enjoy, and would most likely not gain anything from their experience. Students will not gain any experience from the activities because it seems boring to them and they do not pay attention. I don't take any clubs because of the lack of time. There are some days however that I feel that I have no homework and I can do whatever I want to do. I try to join a club and there is nothing that interest me. I don't play any of the insanely popular sports, neither am I good at chess or other things. There is one club that I am interested in doing but they are only open on the days that I'm busy. I can join other clubs that my friends are in, but I will feel awkward because I don't know anything about certain topics. 
2517	If the school makes it required to do an extra school activity, then some of us will not feel like going to our certain club. Because the clubs might be uninteresting for some students, they will not want to attend, and students will lose interest, and teachers will eventually get tired from teaching unfocused students. 
2518	Feeling tired after a long day of working is very common 
2519	We get tired because of all the stress and thinking we had to do all day. After a normal school day is over, kids are really tired and are exited to go home. We go to sleep late at night, and wake up relatively early, making it hard for us to get up, which makes us more tired than the average person. Making clubs required means that school will be extended. It is not reasonable to force the students to stay an additional few minutes to do more work. Even if the we are not tired from a school day, we still have loads of work to do after school. The same goes for the teachers. They don't want to teach kids for any longer. If the teachers have a bad day than it's even worse because they want to be alone. After their final teaching session is over, they have to do more work like grading test, projects, or homework. When school is over, I'm extremely exited to go home. I'm am sure that everyone else feels the same. If I had to stay in school for any longer, I wouldn't feel good when I come home. When I get home from the extra activity that I'm doing, I'll feel so drained and I won't be able to practice tennis, or focus on studying for a test. My English teacher, Generic_Name, says she is very tired from teaching all day. She thinks that there is no point in making kids more tired because they probably can't do their work correctly at home. With the tired students and teachers, there is no point in required extracurricular activities. 
2520	There is more to just being tired, time management, and interest. We are not going to gain anything from the classes and we will certainly not approve of it. Making after school clubs required creates more problems, Not just for the students and teachers, but for the whole school. Think about what you would gain from the extra school classes, and how easy it is to get that experience by a different, easier method. Our schedule is so cramped we can't add anything else. Some of us might not have like any classes that are provided. Almost all of us would be tired from all the new things we have to do. Think about how tired you would be, and how much time you really have, because extracurricular activities should not be required. 
2521	A world without an ozone. People walking place to place. No electricity. There is no fossil fuel. These are some potential, yet dramatic, long run effects of the growing car usage since the early 1950's. 
2522	This new idea of limited car usage could improve our environment. 
2523	if we were to just not use vehicles a few days out of every month, then these recouces may slowly start to build back up. 
2524	"we all know how worried everyone is about getting in a car accident, or being hit by a car, or getting 'T-boned."" "
2525	It would be wonderful not having to worry about danger or ozone being depleted. Knowing that a energy souce would always be around would be nice too. Everyone could agree that this is a glorious idea and the turn of a new leaf, the start of a new world. A more safe and stable world. So keep them in the garage and grab that bike you bought three years ago. Start peddling. 
2526	I disagree with this because every student in the school must or forced to do an after school activity. 
2527	With this in our cumputers it can read the emotions of students better then the teacher ever could and can get the learns more focused and smarter. 
2528	it would be a good thing because people get to see the sea. 
2529	You should join it because you get to help others and animals. Also it not just a plus for them it is one for you too. 
2530	You should become a Seagoing Cowboy for sure! If you like animals and travling this is the job for you! You can have so much adventure you would'nt even know what to do with it! This generation needs to carry on with the Seagoing Cowboys! To help animals and more! One day we will need your help more than ever! We need this to keep going with the Seagoing Cowboys! He even know himself it was an opportunity of a lifetime.        
2531	to help better their own generations reputation 
2532	develop valuable life skills. 
2533	Many student grow up always being told what to do and how to do it. This does not allow for any creativity or original thoughts to be generated all by ones self. For example, when I was a child, my parents would lay out clothes each morning for me to wear to school. Not only did this limit my creativity, it also limited my self identity because I was unable to express myself in what clothes I wear. This so called favor that my parents would do for me caused me to never learn how to dress myself in a reasonable fashion for the appropriate setting. Just like how the students will never know how to design their own projects if the teachers do not put any faith in the students for just this one summer. The teachers will be able to see a students best representation of his or hers creativity and level of learning because they will have something to prove to society. To show everyone that they are able to do things on their own or independently 
2534	The students need to have the teachers and society's trust to exceed what is expected of them because society will never know what these students are capable of if they are never given an opportunity to prove themselves. This will better the generations reputation if done correctly.  
2535	These students need to be prepared for college and the real world outside of school, such as the work force. For example, if a child wanted to play soccer you would not just sit them in front of a television and watch soccer games. This might be a good way to teach them the general idea of what soccer is but they will never be able to learn the skills that are necessary in the game. That child will never learn how to pass, shoot, kick, or even have the social skills to communicate with his team mates. This goes the same for any other activity. The teachers in this school are treating there students just like this child. If they just give them the summer project and tell them to complete it they will never learn the skills of self-management and creativity that they would develop while design their own summer projects. These are valuable skills that students will need later in their own life time. 
2536	The most important part of school should be teaching these valuable skills to make the students more independent rather than just the curriculum.  
2537	Some people may believe that the curriculum is the most important part of school and that is why the teachers should be designing the summer projects. They would argue that some students would fail at the task of designing their own projects. 
2538	However, even if the students fail at this task they will learn from the failure. They learn what they did wrong in order to develop more skills and when the next opportunity comes they will not fail. Either way fail or succeed the students learn different types of independent life skills that are very valuable and needed for adult life. 
2539	Extracurricular activities can be a number of things. From sports, to working on the yearbook, and even serving on the student council, there are a lot of things that qualify as extracurricular activities. It is good for everyone to be part of at least one activity to keep them occupied and stay involved with the school. Doing an extracurricular activity has a lot of benefits, and doing an extracurricular activity is doing yourself a favor. 
2540	Whether it gives you good experience for your future career, helps you develop good leadership and decision-making, or keeps you in shape, the pros of requiring extracurricular activities far outweighs the cons. 
2541	With more freedom students can explore subjects that they don't know about, or want to know more about. This can also make students get more creative with the project when it comes to design or topic that others may find interesting. If students had more freedom with their project allowing them to be creative and showing the teachers what they can do could benifit them because the teacher can give the student more opportunities when doing future projects. Also if the school some very creative project than the student can be recommended to events or major schools in the future. Also when giving students more freedom it can allow them to express themselves or maybe make a point when doing a project on their own. Also when doing a teacher-designed project then students will fell more restrained and more like they are forced to a project. If students had to do their own designed project than they would probably do it more willingly. 
2542	Summer assignments can be very beneficial in ensuring that students are continuously learning, but the question at hand is, should students personalize their summer assignments or should a teacher-designed standardized copy be given to every student? 
2543	I believe that students should be able to design their own summer assignments 
2544	only the student knows what they need to improve on, 
2545	teachers may attempt to take advantage of this opportunity by assigning a tremendous amount of work 
2546	one standardized paper does not facilitate each individual students needs or learning styles. 
2547	some may believe that it is better for the teacher to design the assignment, because the teacher knows what students need to improve on, so the teachers would provide students with exactly what they need to practice. They might also believe that if a student was to design the assignment, they would purposely make it simple and deny themselves the opportunity to learn. They may also agree that teachers should make the assignments because the teacher is in a position of power in the classroom. 
2548	Although, the teacher is responsible for teaching the class, the student is responsible for knowing which areas they need improvement on. Every student is different, one student may find challenging, another may find it easy. For example, in my geometry class, most students find proportions simple, whereas I find them rather complex and challenging. If I were to design my own summer assignment for geometry, I would include a lot of proportions to ensure I get the needed practice. This is just one of the example of how students know where they need improvement and how a student can help promote their own success. 
2549	Teachers are meant to assist students in excelling at the necessary curriculum in order to pass the course, yet some times they overbear students with work. 
2550	Some students learn better visually, so their summer assignments should include many videos, some students learn better kinetically, so their summer assignments should include hands on activities, and others learn better by hearing, so their summer assignments should include audio material such as pod casts. 
2551	students are able to work with comfortable material, 
2552	personalize the project to their liking which would make them more eager to complete it, 
2553	have the ability to produce less time-consuming projects that can make room for summer activities during the break. 
2554	There are beliefs that teachers should be monitoring and producing summer work for the students themselves. Supposedly, the perspectives of the teachers are valuable, and the projects produced would be putting a massive amount of pressure than of being produced by the students themselves. Although teachers do have high standards and expect the best amount of effort possible, 
2555	A great example of this circumstance would be from the book  Divergent , written by Veronica Ross. In this novel, the main character, Tris, undergoes a significant change in her life; switching factions. The system does not choose for the individuals, every individual has the right to choose accordingly among a set of factions. The ability that one has to make the decision for themselves allows them to be comfortable with a future lifestyle that results in new friends, family, and the way of life. Students being able to personalize how they are going to perform the project, whether or not it will involve partners, and the form of work given will result in students being at a higher level of comfort than if a teacher were to produce the project top to bottom, not knowing if students will be satisfied or comfortable. 
2556	Students have the tendency to not to things if told by another individual, but when the idea is introduced by oneself, the individual is more inclined to do it.  The Hunger Games is a novel that displays a similar effect; being based off of a numerous amount of decisions that could either end up in an individual's death, or survival, a certain scene in this book depicts the choosing of a weapon. The main character, Katniss, chooses a bow and arrow, being a weapon that the character has a great strength in and has a higher chance in succeeding with it. Having the ability to choose and having a personalized approach to the task makes one's task more likely to be completed with great excellence, especially if the individual personalizes the project to aid their strengths rather than their weaknesses. A teacher would not be able to identify a student's weaknesses, resulting in a weaker result than anticipated. 
2557	Summer break is called a break for a reason, and if teachers assign projects that are more time consuming than anticipated, the time that students are given would be wasted. For example, an individual that brings similarity to the topic is Frederick Douglass. Frederick Douglass is an inspirational figure in America's History. The man wants the abolition of slavery. By fighting for his beliefs and going through excruciating pain by his slaveholders, Douglass becomes more and more passionate about gaining the freedom that the man and every other slave deserves. With the ability to control one's own life and decisions, one will have more freedom and space to breathe. Giving students the opportunity to customize the projects to a more time conservative approach aids in both the learning experience because the work is still getting done accordingly, and there is still time reserved for a summer break that the students deserve and should be able to fully enjoy.  
2558	projects given during the summer should be designed by the students themselves because students then have the ability to work with material that best fits their comfort zone, customize a satisfactory project that persuades students to being more eager to complete it, and have the ability to make projects that consume less time, providing a larger window for students to use for summer activities. Students should be able to have freedom when it comes to their summer, and if given the opportunity to customize the work they receive during this time period, the results would be nowhere near disappointing. Making summer projects student-designed is a must.  
2559	When examining a summer project, it can be assumed that learning is encouraged for the purpose of keeping these necessary skills free from decay, so these projects should be student-designed 
2560	they hone important skills regardless of the origin of their design, 
2561	give students a sense of freedom and responsibility, 
2562	encourage children to learn information that they are actually interested in. 
2563	If a project is to be completed during the summer, it is unlikely that the information that the student must learn is specific to one area. If the knowledge is going to be general, then the focus of the research is unimportant, due to the fact that the basis of the project is to build skills rather than to build knowledge. 
2564	This increase in responsibility will create better results from most students, because they must put more effort into the project to not only earn a good grade, but to also earn a sense of accomplishment from a well-done project that they solely created. The stress that this causes can also be a motivating factor that interrupts the natural process of procrastination that most students fall victim to during their summer break. Student-designed projects will create, or at least improve, a child's sense of accomplishment and self-fulfillment, an area that is widely ignored in the educational field. 
2565	Children are often pressured to identify their interests from an early age, and the common overlook made by schools is that children are not often given opportunities to explore new things, and are rarely given a chance to make decisions based on what they want. They will produce better results when given freedom and are made to feel like their opinion actually makes a difference. If a student has interest in one academic field but not another, it would make no sense to stifle their passion and have them create a project that is just mediocre compared to encouraging their interest and receiving a spectacular product. 
2566	"Everytime students hear the word school they all have a similar reaction: ""why school."" This reaction is due to the rigor of work school puts on students' backs and the repetition of constant learning. In order to give students time away, they are given three months of summer break which spans from June - August. During this time many kids choose not to continue learning and a negative effect of this is knowledge and memory decay. In order for their minds to be stimulized and conditioned to learn once school begins, schools are requiring students to complete summer projects. "
2567	on the other hand teacher-designed projects would be beneficial to students because the content created by teachers is consistent with the content learned during the school year. 
2568	Summer projects should be designed by students because they will be able to acquire knowledge in a way that interests them 
2569	Being able to do something which one is passionate about results in the best work that he/she can produce, this is because learning is driven by motivation. When a teacher assigns something for the student to do, he/she does not have an eagerness to learn because of the fact that it is something they don't have a strong passion for. When students are given an opportunity to produce their own projects, their minds open up and they begin to think outside of the box, which results in true creativity. School is based on a set curriculum and students have no input on what they learn and how they learn it, as a result, students lack effort and motivation to learn. Giving students an opportunity to create will eventually lead to increased productivity in later life One example of this is when adulthood hits and students are required to develop a skill set. Students are never given the opportunity to learn individually and this causes students to become dependent on others to feed them knowledge and information, therefore, students will only learn when they are demanded to. Having the freedom to create will give students their best opportunity to learn, whereas when they are not able to design certain projects, their goal shifts from learning to completing which will result in the content not actually being analyzed and took in. 
2570	Not only does students designing their own projects give them a opportunity to pursue their interest, but it also gives them ability to express their ideas in a fashion which they are not pressured and limited by others. 
2571	Students become boxed in boundaries due to the pressure of doing things a certain way and learning the way teachers tell them to. When students can design projects and learn in a way they believe is beneficial, learning becomes less of pressured task and more of a way to explore one's horizon. One thing students struggle with the most when completing assignments and projects is constant pressure. Students do not have the ability to express their ideas because they have to stick to an exact rubric. One of example of this is a science expo; many teachers tell the students what they should do for the project and don't give the students time to think about what interests them. This pressure of another voice constantly in their head makes learning and expression of ideas a struggle. In order for students to reach their full potential, they should be able to design in a way they are not boxed by others. 
2572	In contrast to student-designed projects, teacher designed projects also have a positive impact on students because of their ability to create content which is consistent with the content students learn during the school year. Thinking outside the box and being able to express ideas is very important, however, without teachers, students would have no path of what to learn and how to learn it because they do not have the experience and accumulated knowledge many teachers have. Teacher-designed projects would be beneficial to the students ability to learn during the summer because the content would be structured in way which is taught during the school year. An example of this is when a science teacher assigns a cell packet project which corresponds to the cell unit taught during school. This might be very boring for a student to learn, but doing this project will set the student up for success when school begins. If the student were to design their own project it would probably not be in line with the certain style of teaching which will cause the student to struggle during the school year. The main focus of teachers is to help students succeed in school and by designing these projects students will be able on the correct path to fulfilling that goal.  
2573	Summer projects should be student-designed because students will be able to learn in a way which interests them and express their ideas without limitations and pressure by a teacher, on the other hand, teacher-designed projects would be beneficial to students because the content created by teachers is consistent with the content learned during the school year. Being able to acquire knowledge and learn in way which interests one self is very important throughout his/her life, however there are different goals for both the student and a teacher. The teacher's goal is to help the student succeed in a certain class, whereas the students goal is to learn what they want in a way which interests them. Having the right balance is very important and this balance can be obtained by students designing their own projects in the summer and teachers guiding students during the school year. This method will result in individuality development and the teachers can lead the students on the right path throughout the school year.  
2574	I believe that while the answer is not simple, students should overwhelmingly be in charge in terms of the creation of these assignments, 
2575	students learning differently, 
2576	the differing levels of preparedness among students, 
2577	the different interests that students have in relation to the same topic. 
2578	Some students may learn better with standardized tests or by listening to lectures and reading textbooks, while others may learn better with a more hands on approach, creating intricate projects or captivating presentations. This aspect is just as important to understand in the context of summer assignments. The majority of teacher created summer assignments are simply reading, whether that be chapters in a textbook or Shakespeare's plays. While this approach works quite well for some students, myself included, it is detrimental to the learning of others. It would be far better to give students an end goal of understanding to work towards, such as a presentation on the material at the beginning of the year, and let them create their own paths to understanding the content that they are supposed to be absorbing over this period. This would also go a long way to increase student engagement in the material, as students would be less likely to see this summer assignment as something of a chore, rather seeing it as a way to express themselves through the way that they learn.  
2579	This issue is seen extensively with the summer assignments for harder classes, as students may be looking to improve in a subject area or challenge them self, but not have the proper knowledge or skill set to properly learn the content that the teacher wants them to know. For example, a friend of mine wanted to take AP US History this year, but had taken only Academic World History last year. When it came time to complete the AP US History summer assignment, he was out of his depth and did not understand how to properly outline the chapters that we had to read. If we let students design these summer assignments, it will be easier for these kids to access new material and challenge themselves while expanding their knowledge, without overwhelming them. 
2580	To bring up history as another example, when analyzing a single topic such as the American New Deal era, some students are fascinated by the economic facet of the topic, while others gain more fulfillment from learning of the radical social change that occurred during this time period, and still others enjoy delving into the cutthroat politics of the era. If students are able to take control of their summer learning, then they are more able to invest themselves into the content that they are learning as it will be something that truly interests them. What teachers should do is establish a baseline topic to understand by the end of the summer, such as the Revolutionary War and its causes, and allow students to research different aspects of this topic and give a presentation on their area of interest. This allows students to enjoy the learning that they are losing their free time to do, but also helps them to continue to learn over the long break. 
2581	I believe that it is a long awaited and necessary change for these summer assignments to become student created and designed, rather than entirely fabricated and mandated by the teachers. It is necessary because not only will it help kids to learn in the different ways that suit and engage them best, but also to help students who have less experience in the subject or who are trying to challenge themselves and find themselves frustrated at the restrictions and requirements of the summer assignment. Added to that, a student driven summer assignment will allow kids to more thoroughly enjoy and become engaged in their learning by allowing them to pursue their passions and interest in relation to that topic, and express themselves through learning in unique ways. 
2582	During the school year, students are continually asked to complete assignments designed and evaluated by their teachers. Schools that assign their students projects during summer break do much the same. It is always teachers who choose course materials, set guidelines, and decide which subjects are worth learning. At the end of the summer, students return with half-hearted attempts at fulfilling their teachers' expectations. 
2583	Some might say that if students could design their own summer projects, they would do shoddy work or no work at all 
2584	However, if students are allowed to pursue their interests, they will be motivated to do their projects. 
2585	Letting students have choice would create an environment more conducive to real learning. 
2586	Giving students the opportunity for self-guided learning allows them to exercise their creativity in ways they typically can't during the school year and learn new skills. 
2587	The absence of strict guidelines would reduce stress. 
2588	During the school year, students have many obligations, such as homework, sports, and jobs. For students who have fewer obligations during the summer, summer break is a welcome relief. For students who have to work or take care of family members during summer break, summer projects are an extra source of stress. For both, more flexibility with summer coursework would reduce overall stress and help them balance their responsibilities. 
2589	According to the LA Times, 253 million vehicles are on the roads in the US. Since there are so many cars on the road, safety is a pressing issue for the American public. At first it was concern over seatbelts, then drinking and driving, and now it is cell phone usage while driving. Since the rise of cell phones, more cases of drivers crashing due to being distracted by their phones. 
2590	Due to this, it should not be allowed for individuals to use their phones 
2591	they have increased the risk of crashes 
2592	fatalites 
2593	injuries. 
2594	It was reported by Edgarsnyder. com, that according to the National Safety Council, 1.6 million crashes are caused by cell phones every year. 
2595	This displays the danger that cell phones pose to the everyday driver. And the danger only becomes more clear when one compares the cell phone crashes to the total number of crashes per year. According to USA Today, out of all the crashes that happen in the United States everyday, 1 out of 4 are caused by cell phones.  These statistics are exactly what shows how dangerous cell phones can be. Distracted driving is one of the main sources of crashes and they are a danger to the modern driver.  
2596	Edgarsynder. com reports that every year, 390,000 people are injured in cell phone related incidents on the road. 
2597	Distracted driving has now become more dangerous than drunk driving. In a report posted by TheZebra. com, 101,000 more people are injured by distracted driving than drunk driving. This clearly demonstrates the inherent danger cell phones displaywhen drivers use them. And since this past time is so dangerous, insurance for those have been caught texting and driving are paying the price. In a report posted by TheZebra. com, in 2011 the penalty for texting and driving was $2.35 added to the premium price. In 2017, the fine added was $226.36. That is an increase of 7,944% in the penalty price. So not only is distracted driving dangerous for the drivers' life, it is also dangerous for the drivers' wallet as well. 
2598	In a article posted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), 3,166 people a year are killed because they were texting and driving. 
2599	That is almost half the number people killed due to drunk driving, which also according to the NHTSA, is 7,000 people a year. Edgarsnyder. com reported that 21% of all fatal teen crashes are caused by distracted driving. The action of using cell phones while driving is not only an unnecessary risk to the American public's safety, it does not seem to have an impact on how dangerous it is to the teens of America. Also mentioned by Edgarsnyder. com, AAA conducted a survey in which 94% of teens said they knew that texting and driving is dangerous, but 35% of those teens said they did it regardless of how dangerous it was. This shows just how little the youth of America know about the dangers of distracted driving. 
2600	Warm air and salty hair, whats better than summer? Nothing! Summer is all about swimming, sleeping and hanging out at the pool with friends. However, that all ends in august, when it's back to waking up at six o'clock in the morning and all that awful hoemwork. Would'nt it be nice if there was a way students could adjust to school without physically beging there? 
2601	it prepares students for the upcoming cirriculum 
2602	aids students in adjusting to their teaching style 
2603	it will help students get back into the swing of school.  
2604	Going back to school after summer break isnt fun for teacher or students, nor is it easy. Having a summer project may seem dreadful, however it can actually be very benefital. As students age into their next year of school the cirriculum gets harder and harder. Having a project to help ease them into their next year of school would alliveate the anxious feelings surrounding that course. In fact, many students are taking advanced placement courses, surrounding those advanced courses is stress and anxiety, a project designed by their advanced placement teacher will help prepare them in what to expect for the year ahead.  
2605	Throughout grade school we all had a hard time adjusting to diffrent teachers as well as their teaching methods. However, if every teacher were to create a summer project to match thier teaching methods, students would be able to adjust to diffrent teaching styles which, not only would benefit the student themselves but it would also their raise their grades dramatically. Studies have shown that a student will perform better with teachers who he/she feels comfotable with, boosting their grades and overall academic perfomance. 
2606	School is hard, there is no question about it. Having the countless hours of homework, while needing to get eight hours of sleep pluse extracirruculars! Theres just not enough hours in a day! Having a project given to students would help adjust them into the swing of school by preparing them for the homework load they are about to be given. This will also prevent students from sleeping all day because they will need to do their project, and still have enough time to do what they want. 
2607	This may help students feel less overwhellmed however it will not prepare them for the rest of their schooling years because as previously stated the course work only gets harder and simplifying the work load will not do anything. 
2608	Summer time is exciting but when it comes to a end it can be upsetting. Feeling prepared for the year to come and all the work along with it could really help one in feeling less nervous, scared, and discouraged. Teachers need to design projects over the summer so students feel excited and ready for school to begin rather than to feel disapointed and unprepared.   
2609	Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue their learning during the break. Every individual at some point in their life has had to make a project of their own. Whether it be a project at school or a project at home for themselves to enjoy. 
2610	an individual has more freedom to choose a topic of their own, 
2611	they are less restrictive 
2612	students can use their best strengths to make a project that is less stressful for them.  
2613	A student has more freedom when choosing a topic of their own with a student-designed project. 
2614	Others may argue that with more freedom, a student might not stick to what they what they are supposed to learn 
2615	Student-designed projects are less restrictive. 
2616	For instance, much of the work we are assigned in school is teacher-designed. From personal experience, when a project is teacher-designed, a lot of the work can be mediocre, as apposed to a project that is student-designed. When students aren't allowed to come up with their own ideas, their imagination is bound and restricted. Some teachers may argue that it doesn't matter that students are restricted, all that matters is that a student gets the work done, but that is not correct. The student wont be as motivated and will turn in a project that is has no effort, therefore getting a lower grade. 
2617	individuals can use their best strengths to make a project that is less stressful for them with student-designed projects 
2618	Do you think every body should do a extra curricular activity? Most people do activities but the school does not run them. A lot of schools dont even host good our a lot of programs. Most activities do not fit every body. After school things separate more time away from peoples family.  If someone makes the team for a sport over a kid who wants it more then that person. The student that made it gets forced to do something he docent want to do, and ruins opportunities for other kids. 
2619	Does working on a school project during your summer vacation sound fun to you? Instead of going out to the beach and see the red flower sun, would you rather stay inside a cold and damp house with flickering electricity, and waste your time doing work for school? For me, I'd choose the beach, no questions asked. Since I'm a teenager in high school, I know a thing or two about wanting some freedom for myself. 
2620	students won't have to worry about time management, 
2621	the work wouldn't be the issue, 
2622	the students would be doing the work for the teachers. 
2623	It really depends on the students schedules, for example, if a student works on a student designed project, and plays a sport in the summer like for instance soccer, the work could easily be completed if the student balances his or her time wisely, maybe playing soccer like at nine fifty in the morning, and working on the student designed project at one fifty in the afternoon, could balance the students time easily. Another example on how students wouldn't have to worry about time management is that, students could also make time to spend time with their families, if they ever plan on going to their cousins birthday, or go to their brothers or sisters sport games, students can choose what times work for them, and their work would have to be their second priority. 
2624	When students make work for themselves, they tend to understand what their own assignment or tasks mean to themselves. For example, students can make their own projects by using websites such as adobe spark or prezi. com , and can also make their own projects on Google PowerPoint. if the student knows how he or she could benefit themselves on making their own work, then the students can accomplish on being their own teacher. Another example on how the work wouldn't be the issue, is that the work itself would not be difficult to get done. when students make their own work, it may not have the same work level like a teachers work, but it can still be educational and it can be easier. If a student designed project was created on Google PowerPoint, then that would not be difficult to get done. 
2625	The student is literally taking the role as a teacher to him or herself. For example, if a teacher is planning to go to Hawaii for the summer, but doesn't have time to create the project for him or herself, then they could ask their students for assistance on that. The students would be in charge of doing the work for the teachers and that could also help with the teachers time management. Another example of how the students would be doing the work for the teachers, if a teacher doesn't show up for summer school and if he or her is absent for it, then they could ask one of their own students to probably be one of the substitute teachers for the summer school. 
2626	it allows caters to their classroom experience, 
2627	it lets students know the expectations in the class, 
2628	students are opened up with new knowledge. 
2629	 Every teacher is made differently; their way of presenting and showing materials differ. Therefore, teachers should make their own homework for the students. For example, if a student make a study guide for a test verses a teacher, who's will be more effective and useful? This is very obvious however, it clears up the air. Teachers make the classroom's atmosphere and lead the class to its maximum success. To expand, imagine if there were no teachers,only students teaching each other. Frankly, it would be chaotic and a disaster. The teachers are there to keep students in check and to create lesson plans and work for the students: to know how the well students are doing. Students do not check how well the teachers do because as students they receive the knowledge while the teachers pass it on to them.  
2630	If the teacher sets an example such as the summer assignments, students can see what type of expectation that teacher and subject has for them. It allows students to see what the teacher has to offer them. If the students make their own image of the class, it could be a hard adjustment for both the student and the teacher. For example, a student comes into AP Environmental Science with a bright colored poster, hardly any sentences and fill with visual diagrams, that student came in with a mindset of expecting that class was going to be visual filled, but in reality, they take notes and notes on end. However, if the teacher assigned to each student that they will be needing to watch a documentary and have notes filled out, every student will come in knowing the rigorousness of the class. If students were allowed to freestyle and choose their own assignment, the likelihood of them knowing the expectation of the class is close to nothing. Like so, using the teacher, can expose the students to the class before stepping in it. 
2631	If a student wrote a summer assignment paper about what they thoroughly know, it does not teach them anything new. They are not receiving any new information, but on the contrary, if they were exposed to a new topic and researched about it, they would be able to retain new information and learn more. It could lead the students to more success to; if they are opened to new ideas and points of views, the student will learn more and be able to grow in knowledge rather than be stuck in the same perspective that they are in. For example, if a student was bias against the creation of country clubs and corporate made communities, but was to read about why those were created due to an assignment, he or she may have a shift in perspective and mind. This does not apply that he or she has changed their mind, but it has opened up their knowledge and gave them a fuller picture rather than it magnified.  Regardless, if students like the subject of research, or not, that practice will help them grow in writing, reading, and critical thinking skills as well. This increase in knowledge applies to when the teacher is designing the assignments. 
2632	the teachers knows best. Every teacher creates worksheets or something for a particular reason, they do not give anything away without reason, and that is the same with the summer assignments. The teachers makes these because they want the students to be able to know and continue on retaining the lessons. It allows teachers to give students a heads up on the future needs, lets students know what type of teaching style they are getting into, and it increases minds and helps students grow for the future.  
2633	About twenty-five years ago, something happened around Mars. NASA, snapped photos of the object. On Mars, there is a face printed on the plant. People think it was created by aliens. NASA said it was created on it's own. Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa. Those are common around Cydonia. A couple of days later NASA saw a nose, eyes, and a mouth. 
2634	If you dont have one you have to walk which means exersicse so youd be in better shape then in all the car riders 
2635	Have you ever been assigned a project that you did not want to work on? This regularly happens to many students, due to a variety of reasons. Although summer projects are slightly different than those assigned during the school year, they cause similar problems. The student might have been lazy, did not have enough time to work on the project, or the topic did not interest them. While schools cannot help much with the former two reasons, they can with the latter reason. Teacher-designed projects can be biased, affecting the student's ability to gain a wide understanding of a topic. Additionally, teachers tend to assign projects on topics that students do not see much importance in, as the topic does not seem to affect the student in any way. 
2636	For these reasons, summer projects should be student-designed 
2637	Student-designed projects allow students to be passionate about the topic they are working on, causing them to work efficiently. 
2638	When students are assigned teacher-designed projects, they are not usually excited to work on the assignment. Additionally, they do not value it as important, leaving the work until the last minute. For example, in 7th grade, my Life Science class was assigned a project about the deer population in Virginia. Many of the students did not actively work on the project, as they found the topic boring. Because they did not understand the relevance of the topic, the students were not passionate about the project. An independent project assigned in my AP Lang class, however, had a different result. The assignment was to write a research paper on a social issue that interested us. Because students were able to write about an issue that interests them, they actively worked on the project. Being passionate about a project also affects a student's performance in class. For example, because the majority of the class was not passionate about the deer project, they did not do well on it. However, on the AP Lang assignment, the majority of the class did well on related assignments, as they were passionate about the projects they worked on. 
2639	Summer projects designed by students allow for creativity. Students are able to express themselves, as they are not restricted by strict guidelines the way they are with teacher-designed projects 
2640	. Because of this reason, students are more likely to actively work on the project and put in more effort. For example, my AOS biology class was assigned a project to research and present information about a group of proteins. We were allowed to present this information in any way we wanted, allowing for creativity. The majority of the students were very excited to work on the project, as they thought of fun ways to present their information. Some students created songs to relay their information, whereas others made fun videos to do so. A few students even baked cakes to provide information about their proteins. Each student actively worked on their project and put in effort to make sure it was done well. The element of creativity allowed the students to see the assignment as a fun project, rather than as a boring task. Because the majority of the students worked hard on the project, they did well on it. Furthermore, they effectively retained the information they researched, allowing them to do well on the corresponding test. 
2641	By allowing projects to be student-designed, schools allow students to develop a sense of self-reliance. This is because the students have to conduct their own research in order to find a topic that interests them, rather than just receive a topic from the teacher 
2642	For example, in elementary school, students come up with their own experiments to test, after which they present their findings at the science fair. By doing so, students learn how to depend on themselves to find information. Similarly, sophomores at the Generic_School take a research class. They work on a wide variety of projects that are mostly assigned by teachers, but towards the end of the year, they must come up with an independent research project that they will work on in their junior year. In order to choose their project, students have to conduct extensive research to understand the topic, as their project cannot have been done before. Additionally, they have to continue conducting research in junior year to allow for a wider understanding of the topic. This allows the students to be self-reliant, as they know more about their project than their teacher, who acts as a mentor. Self-reliance is a very important skill that helps people succeed in the community and workplace when they become an adult, so it is important to establish the skill early on. 
2643	Some people may believe that allowing students to design their own projects creates more work for teachers, putting stress on them. The teachers cannot have a uniform grading rubric and must have enough background knowledge on each student's topic in order to grade them fairly. 
2644	However, by allowing summer projects to be student-designed, teachers do not have to come up with a topic themselves. Additionally, they are exposed to a wide variety of projects, allowing them to be more interested in the presented material. This allows teachers to be more likely to grade the projects fairly, as they do not have to repeatedly look at the same information. 
2645	In conclusion, self-designed projects allow students to be passionate about the topic, resulting in the creation of better projects. Students can demonstrate their creativity, allowing them to effectively retain the learned information. They also become more self-reliant, which will help them when they get a job. Rather than assigning teacher-designed projects over the summer, schools should assign student-designed projects to stimulate learning, as well as shape students to gain skills that will help them succeed when they become an adult. 
2646	"In this article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author gives many details throughout this text as to why he believes that studying Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers. "
2647	Given these details, he uses useful information that we need to know. In the first paragraph he describes what Venus actually is. If he wasn't to do that, people might be misleaded and still assume that Venus could perhaps be a star. The author gives very useful information to describe what Venus is. 
2648	The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy persuit despite the dangers it presents. 
2649	"The author supports their claim by giving numerous details and supporting his ideas.""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endbeavors."" A big issue that is brought up are the harsh conditions Venus brings. ""On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Farenheight, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."" Knowing this, you might think that they must stop there with their research because there's no way they can discover Venus now because it's to dangerous and harsh. That is false, ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray."" Their solution is to have a vehicle hovering over Venus that would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way. It would still be toasty but not deathly. The author claims, "" Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."" The author supports his claim by saying yes, the temperature is a challenge they will face, but NASA has one particular compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus, and they will continue to challenge themselves and find solutions to these conflicts they face. "
2650	"The author mentions, ""More importantly, researchers cannot takes samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance."" Although this may be a challenge, the author states that many researchers are working on innovations that would allow their machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to their knowledge of Venus. In paragraph 7, it states that NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus, and that it is possible and worthy of doing so. One project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers. ""By comparison, systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat and other forces."" "
2651	"The author does a good job by using details to support that although this is a challenge, they are willing to dive deeper into studying this ""Evening Star"" known as Venus. "
2652	"In coclusion, the authors final claim states, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."" Although there are many dangers that could seek upon them, they take them as ""challenges"" and are willing to dig deeper to find out why Venus is the way it is. ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth- like planet in our solar system."" Therefore, this is why the author does a good job by suggesting that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.    "
2653	The author of this article uses many valid points and reasonings to support their idea. 
2654	"In the second paragraph, the author states ""...Often referred to as Earth's twin, Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too."" "
2655	They are insuring that a helpful reason to research this planet would be because it is similar to earth, and a relative distance away. 
2656	"The author also states that ""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."". This shows the readers that Venus is worth studying because there may have been life on this planet. Therefore, NASA needs to send researchers to Venus to identify if there is life or not. The author gives another example by referencing Earth-like features to show that thesremay be some form of life or a way of nature, these references include Venus having mountains, valleys, and craters. This validates the authors point well. "
2657	The author also gives ideas on how to help make a possible trip to Venus easier and less dangerous. 
2658	"They talk about using a bump-like vehicle that orbits or hovers about 30 miles above the surface. This vehicle has benefits, and also gives disclaimers. Some benefits would include astronauts being able to explore the land easier, avoiding the ""unfriendly"" ground, and keeping good air pressure. the text states ""however, peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safey far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, redndering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective."" This shows as a disclaimer to give unbiased proof ofnegative effects. "
2659	This article is full of evidence to support the authors idea of studying Venus. The author referred to Earth, recommended ideas, and a technology project used with old computers to support their claim. In conclusion, this article had very well put-together evidence, and proves a point that Venus should be studied despite the dangers.          
2660	Summer assignments are not a favorite topic.  When it comes to the whole idea of a summer assignment, we expect a teacher-based project that informs us on what information we need to learn and construct.  Teacher-designed summer assignments allow for higher understanding of a subject, less overall work for students, and a more accurate workload that shows the knowledge of the student.  Summer assignments are meant to help students learn and prepare for the next school year.  They aren't meant to trick and deceive students into thinking that they can fudge their way through the course.  Following the rules is how you will succeed.   
2661	It helps animals that might not make it otherwise live until they get wherever they are going, then someone can take care of them and make sure that they are okay. 
2662	All you have to do is feed them, clean them, and clean there stalls. It is not a hard job, 
2663	there is also plenty of time for sightseeing and other things once you arrive at your destination. 
2664	It doesn't even take long to clean there stalls if you keep up on the work. There is also sometime between pickups of the animals for yourself, or for playing with friends in the empty hold after animals have been delivered. Delivering the animals is always fun, seeing the smiling faces of the little kids riding there first horse, seeing there first cow, or anything else. It's guaranteed to bring a smile to your face.

It really is awesome to go sightseeing, get tours of famous places, and see all the tourist attractions that you wouldn't even have a small chance at seeing if you weren't a seagoing Cowboys. Please join us, and have some fun while your at it. 
2666	people work better with ideas they're familiar with, 
2667	this gives students more freedom with subjects for a project, 
2668	students are more willing to do something they want to do or research. 
2669	Making a project on a familiar concept means students would be able to write more in-depth about it. They'd also be able to understand it better since looking something up doesn't always give you enough info about a subject. Imagine trying to write a in-depth analysis on Didgeridoos when you've never even heard of one or even have background information on instruments. Familiarity with your work makes it come to you naturally and having the freedom to choose the subject of a project is important. 
2670	Most of the time, teacher-assigned projects would have all the students doing or researching the same thing. While this makes the assignment easier to grade and gives everyone a common goal, some people want to look somewhere else. Choosing your subject could bring about interesting results and give you a new interest rather than just being given the generic science project where you monitor and grow a small plant for x amount of time. Working on something you, personally, picked out could also inspire you to put more work into the assignment. 
2671	Researching a subject that interests you, rather than something else, would make anyone more productive. There are lots of ideas people would look further into if prompted and this would be that prompt. Students would be able to enjoy looking up information on subjects interesting to them and put them on paper. They'd be able to turn in a well-written paper and get a good grade just for researching a fun subject. 
2672	having students create their own summer projects would be highly beneficial towards productivity on said project. The benefits outweight the negatives and more students would work harder on these projects. Being limited to certain ideas will make it so students don't try as hard to think outside the box. This type of work also helps students find things they're interested in for later. All of these things would help them work better and earn better results, but they'd also find more information and learn better this way 
2673	In no regard is this a safe practice and drivers should not be allowed to use a phone under any circumstance as it only amount to a more dangerous driving environment 
2674	"This usually occurs in teenage age groups who have a commitment to checking their phones while driving. Teenagers assume that by taking their eyes off of the road for solely two seconds, they aren't putting themselves or anyone else in danger. In reality, distracted driving via cell phone use ""reduces the amount of brain activity associated with driving by 37 percent,"" (""Cell Phones""). Taking calls or texting confidently reduces a driver's ability to control a vehicle, respond to driving events, and direct attention to the roadway. This isn't the case for just teenagers. These conditions apply to every driver who attempts to use their cell phone while driving, thus creating a dangerous driving environment. People often drive with family members, close friends, or children in the car. The chance of a fatal crash because of distracted driving is high and it is very possible that these family members, close friends, and children could be injured or worse. It is much safer to restrict all phone use while driving in order to ensure that roadways remain safe. By not using a cell phone, a driver is better able to pay attention, less likely to crash, and following the law (""Cell Phones""). "
2675	"For instance, Georgia enacted Joshua's Law in 2007 requiring 16 year old drivers to complete driver's ed. The state also recently approved the Hands-Free law, which in essence eliminated any and all distracted driving practices. States recognize the problems that come with cell phone use while driving and have taken steps to fix them. This is evidence enough that in no way, shape, or form should drivers be allowed to use cell phones while operating a vehicle. For further support, there are about 9 people killed and 1,000 injured daily in the United States because of distracted driving (""The Dangers of Distracted Driving""), thus the popularity of cell phone use while driving is a damaging practice in the U.S. and should be ended immediately. "
2676	Although cell phones may be used in a beneficial manner while driving, such as GPS use, crime reporting, or roadside assistance, 
2677	it is a more viable and safe practice to prohibit its use until a person it not behind the wheel of a vehicle. A person only puts themselves in more danger, even when doing something appropriate with a cellphone when operating a vehicle, by trying to utilize it and maintain focus on the road at the same time. 
2678	In sum, it is in the most obvious interest of all drivers that cell phone use while driving be prohibited in any way or form. It is a dangerous practice that puts family, kids, and friends in immediate danger. Any benefits that are noted of cell phone use while driving are miniscule compared to the risk one takes by even looking at a phone for two seconds. Considering states have had enough common sense to begin a prohibition of the practice in favor of all drivers' safety, it is more than adequate to say that drivers should in no manner be given the opportunity to contribute a fatal driving environment by using a cell phone. 
2679	Since the birth of the internet and social media, the world has shifted to greatly favor the innovators and the free-thinkers. Society no longer demands students to find one subject they are good at, go to college to study that subject, and then get a middle class job in that field. While performing one skill at a very high level still holds value, the most successful people are those who can think ahead of the curve, those who can think of the next Amazon, the next Netflix, the next Uber, the next big thing. So, how does that relate to whether we have student-designed or teacher-designed summer school projects? 
2680	letting students design their own projects gives them more freedom, allowing them to think outside the box, which aids the development of valuable skills that are applicable in the real world. Instead of teaching students how to follow directions on a rubric, we should be teaching them to think creatively and how to collaborate with one another. 
2681	Allowing students to design their own projects gives them far more freedom than a teacher-designed project ever could 
2682	Keeping students on a leash forces them to wear a one size fits all education. Each student is different; they all have different strengths, different weaknesses, different motivations, and different goals. That is why we need to give them tailored education. Giving students this freedom would allow them to create a project that works well for them, and more importantly on a topic they are actually interested in. If we let students do a topic they enjoy, the results will be far better compared to when they are forced to learn about something they have no long term interest in. The freedom students gain from designing their own projects is far more valuable than just following the directions their teachers gave them. 
2683	Arguably, the most valuable skill in today's society is the ability to be able to bring a new unique perspective and thought process to any discussion. That is not a skill that can be obtained by constantly being told what to do and how to do it. Students need to learn for themselves how to go to the drawing board, find out which ideas are bad, which ones are good, and then create a plan to execute the good ones. That is not something that can be spoon fed in the classroom. That's why student designed summer projects are the perfect opportunity for schools to do their part in teaching students how to think creatively. 
2684	When forced to come up with their own ideas and think creatively students will develop and enhance skills they would have never had the teacher been the one designing the project. 
2685	For example, if it is a partner project these two students will have to learn how to collaborate together to design a project, designate jobs to each other, and hold each other accountable for their share of the work. That kind of collaboration never would have occurred had the teacher done all that for them. When students go on to college and into their professional career they will have to learn skills like collaboration, because they won't have someone doing it for them. That is why it is important we take the time to prepare them for than now. 
2686	"A wise man once said, ""don't follow where the path may lead, but go where there is no path and leave a trail."" I believe that quote perfectly represents how we want our students to think. The skills developed through out of the box thinking which can be achieved by allowing students the freedom to design their own projects is far more valuable out in the real world then anything the teacher could prepare.        "
2687	Instead of having the same boring schedule every day of going to school, home, repeat, imagine being able to dress up for home games with your sports team, or hanging out with friends after school to work on the plans for the yearbook! 
2688	Adding the rule that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity would be a fantastic way to make sure that students are getting involved with their school. 
2689	There are so many choices for everyone in the school. From sports, to crafting, Future Business Leaders, and many more, students are sure to find something that they enjoy. 
2690	Doing extracurricular activities can help make friends 
2691	keep you active 
2692	form a second family away from home 
2693	It can also help you later in life with time management skills 
2694	Being on a team, you know that people have your back during a game. After being involved with the same group of people, you start to form a bond that makes everyone so close. Having an outlet with people that you know, and are close to, can really have a positive impact on you're life. 
2695	This includes having to wake up early to go to a practice, or meeting. Also being organized and prepared is a big part of the responsibilities that come with joining a group. 
2696	To be allowed to be in extracurricular activities, you must be a student in good standing. Which means you need to be passing all your classes in order to do anything before of after school. This rule makes students strive to have better grades so that they are able to participate. 
2697	There are mostly benefits when it comes to having this addition to the schools policy, it would be a very smart thing to put in place. From making new friends, to doing better in school and later on in life, the schools fresh and more positive environment will be full of hardworking and high striving students. The involvement in organizations has a lot bigger of an impact than you think. 
2698	The author has written in problem/solution format and gives solutions to the problem that Venus is too dangerous for humans to study. Although they give the problem and solution, they do not give enough evidence to support their claim. 
2699	"For example, ""Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors"" (The Challenge 8). This evidence is only given in the last paragraph of the article and is not mentioned anywhere else. Also, the author lists many of the dangers of traveling to Venus, but does not dictate why it is worth the risk of exploring the planet. "
2700	"The author also suggests that Venus is a good candidate for exploration because of it's occasional proximity to Earth. ""...sometimes [Venus is] our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel"" (The Challenge 4). "
2701	"The author says even if they could get a spacecraft close enough to Venus and for it to be survivable for humans, there would be only limited insight on ground conditions: ""... most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective"" (The Challenge 6). The author does not support her claim even further because after proposing a solution to the problem, there would not be any valuable data gained from a journey that is already very dangerous "
2702	"The author mentions that no spacecraft has survived on Venus: ""...no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours"" (The Challenge 2). Since these missions have been unmanned, there is not much loss except for the spacecraft itself, but if there had been a human aboard, the loss would be tremendous and nothing would be gained from the mission. The conditions of Venus simply will not allow manned missions for closer examination of the planet. "
2703	"The author goes on to list the physical dangers of Venus: ""On the planets surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet"" (The Challenge 3). On Venus, the temperature alone could liquify many metals and completely destroy spacecrafts that were sent there. Also, the pressure of the atmosphere could crush a submarine fit for diving to the deepest parts of the ocean. "
2704	The author does not support her claim that Venus is worth studying despite the dangers it presents. First, the author only mentions support for her claim in the last paragraph of the article. Second, the author presents a solution to the problem, but says that no data can be gained from the experience because of the conditions of Venus. Third, the author presents the dangers of exploring Venus, and those dangers outweigh the benefits of exploring the planet. 
2705	I think having every student be in a extracurricular activity is a great idea and i completely agree with the principal 
2706	and it could help students get to know the school and staff and make the school a better learning environment. 
2707	Some students might need help in some of their classes 
2708	So because of that reason they could be in an extracurricular club like study hall or homework club. Students could help each other master the material by reading it over with each other or quizzing each other on the material. If a student cant be with a teacher after school for whatever reason they could go to a student in their class for help. Sometimes getting help from one of your classmates can be better than getting help from a teacher. These are ways students could get help in school from having extracurricular activities and have more success in their classes.  
2709	By being in a extracurricular activity like book club or yearbook, it could be an opportunity for students to become more social and meet new people. 
2710	Some students could be quiet and anti-social but, by being in these activities they could meet new friends and people to talk to at school. They could meet those who they share common interest like video games for example and could bond over those things. Or people who like sports and like to talk about sports. Extracurricular activities can be a great way for students to bond and get to know the people they go to school with. 
2711	Being in these extracurricular activities students can get to know the school and staff better and make their school a better learning environment for themselves and others. 
2712	Some students might not know a lot of information about the school they're attending. But with these activities students can connect with their teachers and staff on a deeper level and get to know them more. This could also help them in the classroom. By knowing more about their school they could contribute to making their school a better learning, safe, and fun environment to be in. This is how being in an extracurricular activity can help students get to know their school, the people that work there, and make the school a better environment. 
2713	"Actress and singer Audrey Hepburn once remarked, ""Nothing is impossible. The word itself say I'm possible!"" The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" agrees. They claim that although venturing to a planet that is seeminly un-explorable is dangerous, it is also a worthwhile and necessary mission. "
2714	By justifying why it is crucial to continue our efforts to explore Venus, and additionally through their explanation as to how this can safely be accomplished, the author of this article strongly supports their idea that studying Venus is a noble pursuit despite the many obstacles that it creates. 
2715	"One way that the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" supports their claim is by explaining the sheer value and benefit of going to Venus. "
2716	"While it is true that several conditions on Venus' surface are inhospitable and unable to support or sustain human life, the author claims that ""astronomers are fascniated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system,"" (para 4). This might lead to discoveries that could help us understand or predict Earth's future evolution patterns. "
2717	"Besides this, Venus is at times the closest planet to Earth as ""Earth, Venus and Mars, our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds. These differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus,"" (2). This could be extremely beneficial to both the inhabitants of earth and for future space travel because Venus will sometimes be our ""nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel,"" (4). All of these statements and claims that the author make support his/her claim that the exploration of Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it entails as they are quite literally explaining to their readers why exploration is as important as it is. This tactic has the ability to make audiences aware of the importance of such a mission, and hopefully persuade them to agree. "
2718	"This, in turn, aids in convincing readers that might have originally disgareed with the author due to the fact that Venus' ""conditions are fare more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth; such an environment would crush even a submarine assustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals,"" (3). The author, after making this counterclaim, refutes it by talking of some solutions to this ever-looming issue: ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions of the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape,"" (5). The author talks of how the air pressure, temperature and radiation would all be survivable for humans. Some, such as the air pressure 30 miles above Venus, would be almost identical to Earth at sea level. "
2719	"The author also disscusses other potential solutions, such as possibly using silicon carbide, a material that has ""been tested in a chmaber simulating the chaos of Venus' surface and [has] lasted for three weeks in such conditions,"" (7). These all are possible ways to make a trip to Venus much safer and, more importantly, they all help support the author's claim. "
2720	"Overall, the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" makes a claim that although Venus has some exceptionally dangerous conditions, it is a planet worth exploring. They support this claim very well by explaining the importance of going to Venus, and providing a few solutions that might reduce the risk factor of this type of mission. All in all, this author, much like Audrey Hepburn, proves through this article that they feel that nothing is truly impossible, not even a trip to Venus. "
2721	Imagine this: Rolling around in a field with your great friends, some you don't know, but some you want to meet. Having fun, laughing, enjoying life. Some people don't get to enjoy that experience. Some students don't want to push themselves for something they want to strive for. I think that it is important that students give extracurricular activities a try. 
2722	People can meet new people, 
2723	students could have a really fun time 
2724	it can be a great way to find a new activity that you are really good at and like. 
2725	"Bill Smith from the Virginia Board of Education implies, ""Lots of children don't love school, so I believe that if there is anyway to make it a little more exciting and have fun activities, then kids would like it better."" I think that is a good point, lots of kids and including me don't love school so it would be cool if we had to do an activity because maybe that is something students would look forward to after a long day of school. Being in an extracurricular activity can be a great opportunity to have fun and not worry about school, which I think is important. That does depend on what activity you are doing. You want to be doing one that you love, because if you werent then it would not be a happy experience.  "
2726	"Sally Sue, secretary of the Bayview High Middle School say that, ""Finding out who you are and your strengths is a very important thing for this world and who you want to become."" That is a very good thought, I think that who you are is an important thing for you to figure out. Even from just doing a silly extracurricular activity you can find out what you are good at and what you can accomplish for life up ahead. I know a friend who is doing a yearbook and photography club, and maybe that is her way of finding out if she wants to do photography when she is older or not. It is a great way to find out if you want to do it in the future. "
2727	"One thing PROPER_NAME from SCHOOL_NAME suggest, ""Lot of kids are in different programs here, but not a lot of the kids know each other. We purposely put kids in different groups to learn about each other."" That is a cool idea. I feel that at our school not everybody knows each other, having those actives, I believe could solve that. For example, I was in this club at my school and I had no friends in it and I didn't really like it because of that. Then I started talking to people and I started to become really good friends with some people that I am still friends with to this day. "
2728	"Some people believe that students may be to busy for these activities. Editor Jerry Ram from the Michigan Company says that ""Students and teachers are busy a lot of the times, kids have homework and other things going on in their lives."" "
2729	"On the other hand, the activity does not have to be very long nor everyday and it could even be during school at the end of the day. For example, Timmy Lung from the Board of Supervisors argues ""When people thing about activities they think after school, but that is not the case. Activities can be during any time of the school day."" I agree with that, when we do Clubs at BRMS we do them at the end of the day. That way kids can go home and go and do homework and have time for their other sport. I know that if we had extracurricular activities after school then it would be hard for me because I have other sports to do and lots of homework on top of that.  "
2730	students should all try at least one extracurricular activity. Doing this, It can give kids a try on what they may want to do when they grow up and for the future, it also could be a very fun and exciting experience for the students, and lastly students could meet and talk to new students that they don't typically talk to. For this to happen you need to take action so you should go and write a letter to your principle saying and expressing what you think. Also if you are already doing an extracurricular activity then speak up to people you don't really talk to and be open minded to anyone. 
2731	"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit depsite the dangers it presents. The author uses strong details to support this claim throughout the article. Facts and statistics by NASA and other reliable sources are used to back the claims. The author stands by the opinion that Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. "
2732	The author claims that the idea of inhabiting Venus is worthy due to its similarity to Earth. 
2733	"Paragraph 4 states, ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system. Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth"" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). If Venus could've supported human life long ago, it is likely the planet still can. The scientific facts throughout this statement support the author's claim by having a reliable source of information, supporting the idea. Paragraph 4 reads, ""Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters"" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). Venus already has Earth-like landscapes and other similar formations. This supports the author's idea of exploring Venus because it is so similar to Earth, the chances of survival are higher than any other planet. "
2734	"Although Venus is analogous to Earth, there are slight differences of the two planets. Earth has average low and high temperatures, while the temperatures of Venus are more extreme. Paragraph 5 reads, ""At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful, and radiaton would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans"" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). "
2735	As stated, the conditions would not be easy for humans, but survivable at the least. This supports the author's claim because this proves human life could be achieveable overall. 
2736	"This means there is a worthy reason to explore Venus; to discover another habitable planet. Along with successful life on Venus, our modern technology could also survive the planet. Paragraph 5 states, ""Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape. Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground codnitions by staying up and out of their way"" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). Moreover, if airplanes are already in existence, new aircrafts would need to be slightly adjusted to suit the conditions of Venus. The author's claim is supported in this quote because this is another reason Venus is worth exploring. The technology needed is already almost perfect for the planet, therefore not a problem NASA would have to approach. "
2737	"Some issues still remain for the exploration, however NASA has already started preparing solutions. The heated state of the planet may be an issue, but NASA is studying a resolution. Paragraph 7 reads, ""For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions"" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). This new technology created could lead to a long-lasting basis for human life, yet another reason exploring Venus is a brilliant idea. Modern technology is too fragile for the harsh heat of the planet, but with some older computers, that as well could survive on Venus. Paragraph 7 reads, ""The thought of (mechanical) computers existing in those days may sound shocking, but these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all. Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions"" (The Challenge of Exploring Venus). This is yet another piece of technology on Earth and prepared for Venus "
2738	The author's claim is supported in this statement because it is a simple solution to technology on Venus. There are very few rebuttals that overcome the postive effects of pursuing Venus.  
2739	With all the easy fixes, solutions and prep planned for Venus, the author's claim is overwhelmingly supported. The author proved Venus is certainly a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. 
2740	"The positive outcomes outweigh the negatives in almost every aspect of this idea. There are multiple reasons presented in ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" that prove attempting to explore Venus has a more successful outlook than not. Throughout the article, the facts and claims highly support the author's claim of Venus being a worthy planet to pursue. "
2741	Summer has finally arrived! No more waking up at the crack of dawn and doing three hours of homework each night. Cheers, to where the fun really begins! That is, until your parents get the email from your teachers explaining the project you have to do this summer. For most of my life, I thought the projects that were given to us during our summer break, was outrageous and too time consuming. Looking back at things now, if it wasnt for those summer projects then I wouldnt have been as prepared as I have been to proceed onto the next grade level. Students tried to protest against not having summer projects at all, but that idea was shut down fast. Instead, the board of education agreed to hold a national vote on whether or not the summer projects should be student based or teacher based. If the projects are teacher based students wouldnt slack in order to get the project done they will actually complete it and teachers are trying to prepare you, they know the material best and are trying to provide materials they know you will need in order to be successful this coming year. 
2742	in order to continue learning throughout the summer teachers should create the summer project rather than it being student designed. 
2743	students would take it more serious than if they were the ones who could choose what the project was based on. 
2744	For example, If the eleventh grade teacher gives all of her students a sheet of paper with a list of more than fifty books that the students are able to choose from, to help prepare them for next year, students know they have to read it and do all the work that comes along with it. But, if the students were able to design the project they could do, they would most likely choose the route that requires little to no effort to have to be put into it. They would choose the book that they have read over one hundred times in the third grade in which they have memorized every comic strip that was said in the book. Making sure that what is given to the students is actually going to help them in the long run and prepare them, shows the students that you truly care about their success in education. If students could design the project, they would do something the last week of summer that is, in which, super fast and easy and turn it in to the teacher the first day of school. 
2745	to insure students are expanding their learning throughout the summer, teachers should be the ones to design the summer projects. 
2746	They are the teachers and have gone through elementary, middle and high school just as most people have. But, they have also gone to college in order to be a teacher. They have learned specific material in which they need to know to become a teacher, regardless of the school. They have already have gone through their studies and have mastered the material. As students you are just now learning things as you grow and develop. To better understand, teachers go to school much longer than student to make sure that they know what they are doing and that they are able to teach the material to all different kinds of students. They know what we need to know and want to help prepare us for the new year abroad. Now if the students were to choose the project then they could possibly choose a subject in which is completely wrong and not needed for the following year to help you learn. 
2747	Teachers dont assign the summer work to be evil toward you, they do it because they want you to be successful in the new school year. They want to set you up for success not failure. 
2748	In order to be successful and retain all the information needed to help you prosper as a student in the near future, teachers should be the ones designing the summer projects. Teachers are helpful in many ways and ensure that they wants to best for you. They do all they can in their power in order for you to be successful. With projects that are teacher designed, students wouldnt slack to do the project, they would actually take time to do it and do it the right way and also the teachers are trying to prepare you for success, they know the material best and are trying to provide materials that they know you will need in the following year.  
2749	Summer projects should be student driven, due to the fact that they allow for self-motivation and individualism, as long as teachers are able to monitor the progress and quality of the work being done. 
2750	A teacher-designed summer project does not allow for the same amount of individualism that could stem from a project designed by a student. 
2751	Giving specific requirements for a summer project for an entire class of students will produce a number of cookie-cutter responses with no variety from student to student. This is because forcing students to fit into a mold limits any possible chance of self-expression. The entire point of creativity is to be outside of the norm, but that is impossible with a teacher-designed project, because 'the norm' is exactly what it is designed for.  
2752	in a standard educational setting, students are not able to pick and choose what interests them, and this can lead to a lack of motivation during the normal school year. 
2753	Finding a subject that one is passionate about is integral to continuing the joy of learning and of new discoveries that is so often lost in the later years of formal education. This is not an issue for student-designed summer projects. Allowing students to pick what interests them for a summer project would solve this issue. With no parameters set by teachers, the educational possibilities are endless for a student. 
2754	regardless of how much a student is willing to learn on their own during summer vacation with a student-based project, teachers still have their place in this system. 
2755	Checks and balances are necessary for any system like this to function, and summer projects are no different. Some parameters for these summer projects should be set by teachers. Otherwise, there is no way to ensure that actual learning is taking place during what is supposed to be a learning experience. Teachers also need to have the ability to grade any given project, which would be difficult to do objectively if no parameters were given to the projects. 
2756	Learning does not stop at the end of high school, and it certainly does not stop at the end of a school year. Student-designed projects allow for creativity and individualism from each and every student, and allowing teachers to have a guiding-but not controlling-hand in the projects can lead to fantastic academic results.  
2757	"Do you believe in aliens? An abundance of people in America think there are others among us from other planets and galaxies. They believe this for a variety of reasons, such as UFO sightings or because of the so-called ""Face"" in Cydonia on the Red Planet Mars. Throughout the years since 1976 we have worked at NASA to discover the secrets of the face, uncovering that it is indeed just a landform with suspicious shadows. "
2758	because of recent pictures taken of the natural landform, 
2759	scientific evidence, 
2760	and measurements taken. 
2761	"To start, NASA has taken recent picture of Cydonia in 2001 that shows it is just a natural landform that has developed on the Red Planet Mars. ""On April 8. 2001--a cloudless summer day in Cydonia--Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. ""We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degreesto center the Face in the field of view,"" said Garvin. ""Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution."" Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel inv the best 1976 Viking photo."" (p. 10). "
2762	"As discussed before, NASA has taken a new and better quality photo of the Face in Cydonia. Using our scientific equiopment at NASA, we have proven just how much better the resolution is on the new phototgraph taken is. """"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger that the pixel size,"" he added. So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the gtround or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"""" (p. 11). This quote from the article shows "
2763	"On the contrary, some people believe that the face is """"Bona fide"" evidence of life on Mars--evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists"" (p. 5). "
2764	In conclusion, some people may think there is alien life on Mars because of past picture or conspiracy theories. No one can denty however, that NASA has proven the Face to be nothing but a natural landform on the Red Planet Mars. NASA has proven this by recent pictures, scientific evidence, and real-life examples and measurements. Over the years, NASA has worked hard to figure out the mystery of the face, and just recently they have discovered, with pictyures, evidence, and measruements, that the Face is just a natural landform with unusual shadowing formed on the Red Planet Mars. 
2765	It's always best to give students options, and letting them enjoy what they do best at, but it's not right to force them into doing what they don't want to do; yes I agree that after school activities should be in school, and open to all students.  Don't force students into something they don't feel comfortable with, but recommend it to them so they can think about it. 
2766	you get extra help, 
2767	you worry less, 
2768	you create a stronger bond with the teacher. 
2769	By getting extra help, you able to work on your mistakes and fix them. In this case, you are free to get assistence from you teacher regarding any concept you do not understand and he or she will be more than welcome to help you. For example, incase you are working on an assignment that is math related and there happens to be a question you have worked on several times but still can not figure out, you will then find the need to explain your weaknesses to your teacher so that they work on a solution for your concerns and questions about that specific problem you are trying to solve. As a matter of fact, if you happen to be struggling with any particular subject having teacher-designed projects is more helpful and significant hence you are attaining help and directions from a professional person who understands what they are doinig as well as what you need help on a much higher level that outstand that of a student-designed one. That being said, a teacher-designed summer project is a perfect way to continue learning because you are not only being assisted by getting extra help on a specific assignment, but you are getting more knowledge and benefiting your education even when you are not in school. In other words, you are learning from your mistakes by fixing them with the right tools you need through your teacher and that results in you being more confident and comfortable on that very topic or project you had issues with in the first place. Indeed, getting extra help from you teacher will help you get better grades and following a well teacher-designed summer project will put you in good position for working hard and working on your communication skills as well as keeping your brain sharp and training it to endure any complex situations such as making sure you complete any due work and homework on time. 
2770	Because students are on vocations, this is their time to get caught up on their favorite hobbies and fun activities with their friends and one last thing they would want to think about is doing some sort of homework during their free relaxing time with family and friends moreover on a summer morning. For instance, lets say a student wants to hang out with friends on a saturday evening, but they remember they have a whole packet of work that was assigned to them before summer vocation and that by the end of summer before school starts, they have to finish it. The student will most liekly be worried and concerned about getting it over with and that means they will either cancell hanging out with friends and stay home doing random summer assigned homework on a saturday, but this is not the case when you know you are working with you teacher and that they will be able to walk you through all the work. Students surely worry less when they are working with a teacher on summer projects hence them doing something fun and relaxing in their free time sinc their teacher is available at any given point. School related projects or assignments are more easier to handle when your teacher is always there to work with you on that specific assigned assignment. As a result, students are much likely to enjoy their time away from school without anything bothering them for whatsoever case. Since students have already endured and served their time on the previous school year, they do not need any kind of aspect worrying them to the point where they have to stay home rather than them having fun and enjoying themselves and having a good time on a summer beach day while having fresh air and cooling off. Therefore, summer projects should be teacher-designed since students are not getting overwhelmed with what they need complete, but rather having some fun time with their friends and telling jokes and laughing them off with their relatives and maybe their pets who knows. 
2771	By doing so, teachers and students are most likely to get along with each other with no issues of any kind. Teachers are more than people who went to school and got their degree, but they are also regualr people just like everyone esle and at a certain point they become like family to us. So it is important for students to make sure they are in good terms with their teacher just in case they need help or guidance from the teachers, they will not get it if they behaved wrongly or cursed at their teachers which is something we often see in schools today. Well, if students and teacher manage to keep a steady and firm bond between one another, no obstacle or problem will come between their relationship, meaning they will be able to work with each other on a daily basis with no problematic concerns from either side. 
2772	They come in red, blue, green, black, and white. They beep and honk while they ride on highways and transport people form place to place. Cars are everywear. What would the world be like if we didnt have cars? What are the benefits of life without cars? 
2773	Life with out cars benefits the environment, and peoples' health. 
2774	"""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"" (5). In other words, cars are higly responsible for the harmful gases that pollute our atmosphere and cause global warming. In Paris,  a partial driving ban was issued to clear the air after days of high air pollution rates. After the driving ban, ""congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France after five-days of intensifying smog"" (14). By using cars less, citizens can reduce pollution and help keep our earth clean and safe. Statisticts show that fewer people  are using cars around the world. ""A study last year found that driving by young people decreased 23 percent between 2001 and 2009"" (41). Sociologists belive that this trend will continue and possibly increase. They belive it will ""have benficial implications for carbon emissions and the environment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions"" (34). "
2775	it will benefit the health of citizens both mentally and physically. 
2776	"In the German suburb of  Vauban, citizens have given up their cars. A resident there says ""when i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" (3). Limiting car use also limits the frequency of trafic jams, accidents, and unfriendly drivers in a hurry along with the stress and frustration that accompany them. In Colombia's capital, Bogata, the Day Without Cars has had many participants. One of whom said ""It's a good opportunity to take away stress"" referring to the event. (24) limiting stress can have major benefits to a persons health and mental well-being. limiting the use of cars does'nt just positivly effect mental health, it can positivly influence physical health. In Bogata, Colombia, the car-free day inspired residents to ""hike, bike, skate, or take buses to work "" (20). Excersize releases endorphins which are chemicals in the brain related to pleasure. Many people that excersize regularly are happier then when they don't. By limiting car usage,citizens are more inspired to excersize making them happier and healthier. "
2777	"a life without cars means a healthy, long-lasting planet along with a happy, relaxed, and healthy population. Even though cars are conveint, they have many negative side effects. Next time you want to go for a ride, think of all the benefits of limiting them. Rember what a breath of fresh air feels like because the gasses from cars might mean they will be gone soon. Get used to angry faces honking horns, and being given ""the bird"" by angry drivers because with cars come many conveiniences, but also many frustations.    "
2778	student-designed summer projects would be an awesome addition to student learning over the summer. 
2779	Projects are designed to help teachers grade the student on how well they know material or a subject. 
2780	Projects help the teacher get a better understanding of what the child may need help with in order to get better at the subject and/or to pass their upcoming Standards Of Learning test.  There is a boy at my school that we are going to call Generic_Name. Generic_Name does not understand the WWI subjets in his history class. He's been doing his class and homework, been paying attention, he's been writing his notes, but he still does not understand the subject. He's asked his teacher for extra help and has recieved it. While his knowledge for the unit is growing, he still just barely passes his Standards of Learning test with a 401. Over the summer, his school required all students to make up their own project about anything they may have learned. At first he did not think it was going to help him but he decides to give it a try anyway. Generic_Name decides that if he has to learn about something over summer, he might as well learn about something he's been having trouble with. He completes his project with just a month left of summer and now has a better understanding of the war for his next year of highschool. 
2781	In order to help kids better undertsand things, not only should we do projects at the end of every quarter during school, we should do them during summer too. 
2782	To ensure we would have less drop-outs, students who have failed for the year, or kids who simply do not understand the material, public schools should take part in making the project a requiremnt that students must complete a summer learning project of their desire, as long as it is something they know little about. The project is expected to be taken serious as an SOL would. It is a great way to make sure that students would not forget any knowledge over their summer. Also, it would be a great excercise for thier brains as well as it would get them ready for college if they plan on furthering their eduction. 
2783	Although assumptions may lead many to state that teachers, who hold the experience, should deisgn these projects, it is more beneficial for students to design the projects themselves. 
2784	There are many misconceptions regarding the mentality and intuition of students; it is very likely that student-designed projects can prepare them for large programs and/or assignments, such as the Personal Project. 
2785	In addition, it may also relieve teachers of excess work.  
2786	An increasingly common assumption is that pscyhological intuition, and creativity in some aspects, increases with age, thus students are less capable of designing a project, or most things for that matter, than adults. Several people argue that students may lack maturity, 
2787	but various pscyhologists, notably Generic_Name, have disproved the claim, finding no evidence of maturity being linked to one's intuition or strive of creativity. In fact, this myth actually arose due to various reforms of the Progressive Era restricting children and immigrants' personal freedom, which continues to this day. Although many would deem this irrelevant, it is precisely the reason that we must not hold back to provide students with freedom in creating their own projects and avoid persisting a key issue. 
2788	Adding to that, and perhaps one of the most common arguments against teacher-designed projects, is the statement that students are not exposed to projects that require overarching critical thinking 
2789	Research conducted by various universities, such as the University of Chicago, has shown that students are not prepared for upcoming projects every time they complete a teacher-designed project; 
2790	In many states. summer break is one of the only periods of time that teachers can be truly relieved of work, and that time should be maximized by reducing their tasks; if there is going to be schoolwork done during the summer, it is at the very least a moral ideal to relieve teachers of doing unnecessary work that could be easily handed to students. 
2791	Simply put, very few communities should expect to carry out teacher-designed summer projects with pleasing results. As promising as it may seem, it is apparent that teachers should not be given excess loads of responsibility of their students, and it is time to allow the students to take their own approaches to their tasks and prepare them for what is to come. It is not a perfect idea, as no idea can be, but everyone must take steps to reach their end, even if it is gradual. If we are to see to the success of more students and further cememt the well-being of our educators, this is a crucial step that should be taken.          
2792	have you ever heard of the greenhouse affect, global warming and air pollution? the abundant usage of cars have a large affect on those vital things in our environment . 
2793	The dreaded summer assignment, boring students by holding them hostage inside and not letting them enjoy their time to be free. All the stress of the school year washes away when students leave the building in June, but then students are reintroduced to that stress with projects and extensive work that may not be of interest. The more likely the students are uninterested in the work, the more likely they are to not turn it in, so why not make summer assignments what the students want while introducing the course they are set to take. 
2794	students can take interest in their study 
2795	make learning fun.  
2796	" Nobody in the world wants to wash summer away with book work from the class they don't like. Projects like research papers, essays, and 20+ page packets can drown students for the months they have off. Summer before sophomore year, for my history class we had 2 20+ page packets to ""introduce us to the course"", when in reality, it was just a few hours a day for weeks of busy work of finding answers in textbooks. Painful summer projects, like my class's history packets, will put a bad taste in the students' mouth before they even step foot on school grounds for the year. "
2797	Summer assignments have to be short, sweet, and efficient, or they will lose the student, potentially for the entire school year. 
2798	Students should be able to pick a topic for a standard project, like a short PowerPoint or a poster presentation, where students can go hands on while learning. Those history packets would be much more involving to me if they had to do with the World Wars or Military history, and even more if they involved some sort of project component. Disinterest also causes students to be less likely to complete summer assignments. I know of plenty of students, that just won't turn in the project or assignment if they don't want to do it. Summer of Junior year, my class had an essay to write about a current political issue. Half of the class turned in that assignment on time because they just didn't want to do it or were plainly uninterested. Summer Assignments need to be like those A+ introductions to essays, they need to grab the reader and hook them into the topic early, or in the case of summer assignments, they need to interest the student so they keep going and are hooked for the year. 
2799	The only way for a project students like to be made, you have to consult the students. Politicians in democratic governments don't guess what the voters want, they ask what the voters want. If teachers are trying to build something for the students, ask the students, it's simple. If teachers want more interest in a course, better grades, more students willing to work, more participants in class, or better summer projects, the only way to do so is to let the students design the assignment. Students designing the project will make learning fun. 
2800	the projects will be more creative, 
2801	the students will be more interested in doing the projects.  
2802	if a teacher were to hand out a project, there would be certain things that you would have to follow in order to get a good grade on it. If it were a student-designed project it would have follow a guide line to make sure it is on topic. Another example, every year in elementary school teachers would give a checklist for how many books you read. Students don't want to do that at all but if teachers told the to keep track of what they did through out the summer that might be fun. Students should design the projects because students are more creative than adults and can come up with projects that are fun for them.  
2803	Students should design the projects because they can come up with fun idea's for a project. 
2804	instead of reading a certain amount of books for a grade, they can set a challenge goal like trying to see who could swim the fastest in a certain amount of time, they can record how much tropical foods they have eaten. Another example, when summer starts students can keep record of how many miles they walked or ran. Students can keep track of how many miles they traveled in the summer and at the beginning of the school year they can see who traveled the most and Whoever had the most can get a special prize. Students should design the projects because the students would have a lot more fun doing the project. 
2805	if teachers were to design the projects students wouldn't want to really do them. The students would want to do something they're interested in, not an assignment from the teacher for the summer. Another example, Students are interested in what they're doing because they want to. When teachers make the projects they want you to get a good grade but they really don't care if you are enjoying it. Students should design the projects because while they are getting a good grade on them, they are also interested in what they are doing. 
2806	Students should design the projects because they can enjoy doing the project, they can have fun while doing the project, and also they can be really creative when they need to do a project they're interested in.  
2807	it should be student based because the project would still complete its targeted goal and still help students have continuous learning over break. 
2808	Summer time is the time when most of us are outside making plans, meeting family, going around the world, and even just relaxing without any problems from the world. Summer break was made to help our brains take a time off of work, school, and stress. But even when we are on a break there is always something we need to do or can do that will help us have that continuous brain activity so when we are back from break we did not lose all of our knowledge and working habits and can hop right back into learning and working. 
2809	the work can be kept to a minimum and still have us have that constant brain flow and typically teachers dont understand that for students. 
2810	When assigning work to students over break, teachers normally would base the work and projects on how much time we have. 
2811	If all the work would all be teacher-designed, they would see it like; the longer the break would be the more difficult and longer the assignments or projects should be. That would not be too fair for the students that deserve the break after having 9 months of constant learning and hard work in school. Also If the projects were to be teacher-designed it would not be fair to even the parents that are on break too because they have to stay at home and wait for their child to finish the work before starting their summer vacation or their family activities. 
2812	The purpose of the work over breaks is understandable, to ensure that we do not lose our knowledge and keep our brain working so when we go back to work it would be easier to get into learning and working as soon as possible. 
2813	But the work can also be easier but can target he same objectives, this can be obtained if it were a student-designed project. Students know their limits and the targets for the projects so students can personally complete their own tasks and get the work done at their own pace. It would be way less stressful if students didnt have to base how much work they get done how they do the work by another persons standards that does not know what other things the student has to do in his or her life. 
2814	All in all summer is a period of time to be stress free but it can also affect our learning and working habits. But we still do need something to challenge our brain to keep those habits and students should be able to control how they do that. The work and their projects over break should be student-designed and not teacher-designed because we can keep the work to a minimum based on our schedule while still targeting the same objectives the teachers would want us to accomplish and both the students and teachers would both get what they want. The students get their break with minimum work and the teachers still get to know our brains are getting challenged. 
2815	Summer is what what every student look forwards to once they're in school, everyone who has been a student knows this. Summer projects can be fun and it's a great way to help students from forgetting the information they learned in school. Having fun and getting some freedom is what makes summer so special to so many students all over the world. Completing assignments is what school is all about, some can be fun and some are confusing and downright boring. Students do not get to make many decisions with their schoolwork. 
2816	The idea that projects that are assigned over the summer should be student-designed is valid 
2817	students would get a chance to be creative while also being able to express themselves through schoolwork 
2818	make their own decisions like an adult, 
2819	summer is when students get free time so they should decide what they want to spend their time on.  
2820	Students are in school to learn, mature, and become great adults once they're older but they aren't treated as such. Making their own decisions can help them become extraordinary up-front adults. 
2821	Even today many struggle in making decisions of their own; if students are taught to make choose what they want to do, they'll have less difficulty in making good choices for themselves. Sometimes adults do not know what choices to make as some do not choose wisely. Letting students make their decisions through own accord can make it easier for them when they have to make important choices in their life as their brain will be programmed to think about the choice they are making. There are many skills people need to survive in the real world and decision making is one of them. Little things can have a big impact on many; it may not seem like a lot to let students design their projects but it can be a big influence on many. 
2822	Summer is the only free time students get in the school year, they should at least decide what projects they want to spend their free time on. 
2823	Summer is when students can: travel, spend time with their family, have fun and go out. But, if they have to work on projects and they're boring, summer can become dreadful as some assignments are bland and boring. Very few projects are actually fun and entertain students to help them want to keep learning. Free time is valuable to so many students, as it is the time they get to distress and not worry. But if they design the project they want to focus their time on, it can make retaining the information they learned in school fun; possibly making students to want to learn more and even look forward to these summer projects.  
2824	Some may argue that students would not take the projects seriously or that students could do something inappropriate in these projects. 
2825	Some students may be too immature and just give up on these projects, teachers are the ones who are going to grade these projects. So, teachers should decide what they want to grade as it'll be more organized and specified. Also some may say that students are still to young to know what they are doing and may end up doing something that they did not think twice about. 
2826	Summer is fun and special to so many students who currently go to school. School work is dreadful to many, but designing projects does not sound too bad. Designing projects can be fun and a new experience for many. New ways to learn instead of the old traditional boring way can be interesting. Giving students a little freedom would not hurt. Students should be able to decide what they want to do with these projects as it is a great chance for students to discover many new things. 
2827	"If the principal just assigned everyone to a random extracurricular activity(lets assume that thats what happened and that we could not change it.) than the chances of people particularly knowing that activity go down by a lot. If you are not a type of kid who hates to run around, or, you have asthma and you can't run,what if he accidentally enrolls you into the soccer club. You go up and tell the instructor that you can't run and they say, thats fine, but, the principal will be somewhat mad that you can't do the program. ""I guess i'll ask him to get you a different one this time.""Or what if you get stuck with a game like cricket. It is extremely hard to learn how to play that game, and it also is super hard for newcomers. If you were stuck with something like that, than you are not going to have fun with it. "
2828	Lets say that you were chosen to be on the student council and you have a meeting after school. Unfortunately you have a therapists appointment after school at the same time. Will the principal force you too stay or will he let you go like he should do. You might have soccer practice for the junior league championship game that is coming up but you have to sit in a chair and talk about the budget for the Shrek junior play instead. It just would'nt work out with all of the problems, and also the fact that all kids are different and that they should'nt be forced to stay after and miss something important because of their extracurricular activity after school. I just feel like they should let us do what we need to do after school and not bother us with after school extracurricular activities. 
2829	Advantages of limiting car usage are lower greenhouse gas rates 
2830	suburbs can become more compact and more accesible to public transportation 
2831	people are able to live less stressful lives.  
2832	Transportation is the second largest source of America's emmisions and is responsible for fifty percent of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States but is slowly making a change towards helping the enviornment and being beneficial towards carbon emissions. In 2005, the number of miles driven in the United States was at it's highest rate. As time went by, the numbers started dropping and getting lower. Many sociologits believe that if the numbers get even lower and stay at that rate, the benefits will come for the enviornment but unfortunetly not for car companys. Paris typically has more smog than any other European capital and is working towards a way to fix that. Paris banned driving due to the intensity and abundance of the smog in their city and had people use public transportation free of charge for about a week. Not using motor vehicles for those days really did help the situation of Paris and gave people an insight as to how life would be without cars. 
2833	"Vauban, an upscale community in Germany, is home to suburban pioneers who have given up their cars. Seventy percent of Vauban's family do not own cars and fifty-seven percent sold a car to move there. ""Smart planning"" is a component of the movement to seperate suburban life from auto use to create a denser and more compact enviornment and let people be more accesssible to public transportation. This means less space for parking, and more stores compactly placed and at short distances. In Bogota, ""Car-free day"" is part of an improvement campaign which helps residents of the city to see how life is life without the use of cars for a day. People use public transportation and walk to their destinations with no problem. More parks and sport centers have also been added to the area as a result of less car usage, so more space for other important things.  "
2834	Dropping off your kid at daycare, then driving to work, then having to drive your child to soccer practice can be a constant and stressful cycle for most parents. Residents of suburbs that have low car usage rates claim that they are less stressful. In a suburban community with little to no motor vehicle usage, the suburb will be more compact, having more stores and buildings closer to eachother at very short distances. This makes it easier for residents to get from point A to point B quicker and more efficiently. This also allows for more walking areas with less traffic and dangerous cars to worry about. 
2835	Cars can be useful in many ways but for the better of the enviorment, peoples cities, and sanity, little to no car use is the way to go.         
2836	Teens cant follow the adults who they look up too since the adults themselves are setting a bad example by texting and driving which give teens a sign saying it's ok to text and drive. 
2837	A school summer project should be teacher designed even though it puts more work onto a teachers part, but it is better than getting poor projects from confused students in the beginning of a school year. 
2838	Projects already bring stress to students, especially since its summer and all students want to do is hangout with friends or do anything school related. Having a teacher design the project is both relieving and easier, because the student has a foundation of what to do 
2839	they meet the requirements needed from the teacher, 
2840	so that they do not waste time on a project that may not even be right. 
2841	If the student has a based foundation of what to do to begin with, the project already becomes easier to do. 
2842	"With guide lines already set up, the student can continue forth and begin the project successfully. Let us say it was a textbook reading and project based on the reading. Students, for the most part, do not generally enjoy reading pages on pages on pages; however, if a teacher gives a blank statement about what to do, the readings become difficult for the student to comprehend. In a students mind, it can go many different ways to think about a project. Having a teacher design a project base gives the student more to go off of instead of a teacher saying ""Read these pages and submit a project by the beginning of the school year"" is not helpful. By giving a foundation of the project, the student can succeed and be more efficient. "
2843	Meeting the requirements of any project whether it is during the school year or outside in daily life is so important, because the requirements is where a person is scored based on their work provided. For a student, requirements are on a rubric which helps guide the way of a assignment or project. For an example, writing essays are difficult in a way of being confident in their work. Usually reverting to guide lines given by the teacher help boost the confidence of work to submit. Receiving requirements by a teacher give assurance to the student by being able to look and see if they have missed anything or gotten all requirements checked off. For a student, being able to receive such assurance relieves us of stress. The stress will always be there, but some of it would have disappeared.  
2844	If a summer project was student based, a lot of students would be unsure and confused on what to do. Students do not want to waste time on a project they have no idea what to do. It is both a waste of the students time, but also a waste of the teachers time by grading projects that are not correct. 
2845	Having a teacher designed project is beneficial to both a student and a teacher. Work gets put into from both sides, the teacher and the student, to produce an amazing outcome of a project that meets requirements, was time efficient, and also gets the idea of the project. If it were to be the opposite and were to be student based, it would have had a fifty to fifty chance of it having a good or bad project that could not meet requirements, wasted time, and did not get the point of the project. The sole reason of a summer project is to show a student learning, if the project was not good, the project had no affect on the students learning.  
2846	"The number of fatal crashes caused by cell phone distracted driving in 2017 was 434 (""Facts and Statistics: Distracted Driving""). The amount of fatal accidents from the use of cell phones while driving has only gotten worse through the years. Ever since cell phones have become more advanced and more popular, the danger has increased. It is hard enough to stay focused while driving but phones make that task 10 times as difficult. Even something as simple as changing the song or answering a text for a split second while driving can put yourself and others at risk. "
2847	Teenagers are not as experienced drivers and think that driving is a task they can take with ease. Although driving might come easy for some, that does not give room to be distracted. I personally witness cell phones being used on the road daily. My mom and my dad both use talk-to-text while driving and my boyfriend holds his phone in one hand while driving with the other. My friend and I almost got into an accident the other day because she was using her phone. Nowadays society is far too attached to technology, especially phones. Not only are teens learning that using phones while driving is acceptable from their parents, they also think that breaking the law is nothing to stress. 
2848	In mosts states it is illegal to even have your cell phone in your hand let alone be using it or talking on the phone while driving. If the law is not enough to persuade people to stop using phones while driving, the dangers of killing people should. Close to five thousand people died due to cell phone related crashes in 2018 (Texting and Driving Statistics 2019, thezebra. com). Even if someone is not on the phone themselves, someone else on the road could be 
2849	When someone decides to use their phone while driving they are not only putting themselves at risk, they are endangering every other person on the road 
2850	If they look away from the road for even one second and become distracted, they could crash into another person. There could be children in the car that die from the crash, or a pregnant woman. Lives are constantly at stake while in the car, being distracted only makes things worse. 
2851	Cell phone use behind the wheel reduces the amount of brain activity associated with driving by 37 percent (Cell Phone use while driving statistics and texting and driving facts, teendriversource. org) 
2852	They could finish a call or text before they begin driving, leave the phone alone while stopped, and put the phone on silent or do not disturb when driving. Most phones now have a driving more that will mute notifications and send a text back to inform the person they are driving. Even if someone is not driving they can still help. If they call someone who happens to be driving, they can say they will call them back later at a better time. 
2853	For most students, summer means the beginning of a much needed months-long break from school. For some, however, the stress of school never fades away. Some schools require that students complete assigned summer projects in order to continue learning, even when not in school. The importance of continued education is rarely argued, but the way some projects are planned out might not always result in engagement and time investment from the student. 
2854	As a student who has had to deal with a multitude of summer projects, I can say without a doubt that I have never looked forward to spending time out of my day to work on them. The most typical summer project given to me and most students has been summer reading. The books are almost always teacher assigned, subsequently tying them into their curriculum for the upcoming year. Before my junior year began, I was tasked with reading  In Cold Blood by Truman Capote for my English class. Personally, I enjoyed the book, but the project that went along with it was less than interesting. In turn, this led to me putting off my project until the last few days of my summer break, bringing along the stress of having to cram it in before the school year started. Since this project was teacher-designed, I also had to make sure to follow the strict guidelines in order to ensure a high grade when I turned it in to the teacher. 
2855	If I was able to create my own project relating to the book rather than a teacher-designed project, I truly believe I would have enjoyed my finished product more than I did, along with eliminating the stress put upon me by the project's strict guidelines. 
2856	When a student is assigned a summer project, their immediate thoughts are almost always negative. This comes with the fact that they do not want to do work over their break, as this is one of the few times out of the year that they're allowed to forget about school for just one moment. Adding to this, if the student is given a teacher-designed project, this puts the motivation to do said project even lower than before. They know that they have no control over how their project turns out, as they often revolve around a fairly black-and-white rubric, resulting in a lack of diversity and creativity between each individual's project. 
2857	If a student is tasked with the creation of their own project, however, this leads to a wide variety of exciting and new projects that vary from student to student, also placing motivation in their hearts to make the best project they possibly can. 
2858	Often after a teacher-designed project is finished, the only reaction of the student is relief that it's finally over. With teacher-designed projects, students often only work to completion, not to make a project they enjoy. However, if students are able to design their own projects, the reactions to their finished product would give them self-pride that they created what they believe to be their best work. For example, when I created a project after reading  The Road by Cormac McCarthy, I was able to look at my completed project with the feeling of pride and joy that I had truly created the best project I possibly could. 
2859	The increase in moral for these students would give them a more enjoyable learning environment and the excitement of a new school year starting so that they're able to share their work with someone else who will appreciate it. 
2860	Many teachers would argue that the creation of student-designed projects would be unimportant to the curriculum, as they don't truly focus on something that needs to be taught. However, the importance of student-designed projects is to encourage them to be creative and to not be stuck in the mindset of just passing the class, instead opening their eyes to new ideas and allowing them to think outside the box. 
2861	By being allowed to design their own summer projects, students are afforded significantly many more opportunities to learn outside of the classroom and are also able to accomplish their project with a degree of flexibility, letting them both enjoy their time off but also retain information that they learned the previous year. 
2862	Many students have quite the chaotic schedule during the summer months. 
2863	Between jobs, internships, and trying to enjoy their time away from school, it's easy for teacher-assigned work to get tossed by the wayside during this time. 
2864	By letting their summer work be student-driven, kids will be able to adapt their commitments to their teacher's desire to have them continue their learning over the break and not have to worry about finishing assignments by deadlines that they already know aren't possible for them to meet. 
2865	For example, if a student is going to Latin America over the summer, instead of having them mindlessly conjugate verbs on worksheets to submit for their Spanish class, they can actually put what they learned to use out in the world by talking with locals or taking in the culture through music and food. If another student doesn't happen to have a passport and a couple thousand dollars lying around, they can adjust it to their situation, for example going to a local Latin grocery store and buying ingreedients in Spanish in order to make a native dish. 
2866	However, the opportunities extend beyond just languages and cultures. If a student is interning at a company in a different city, they have to learn a variety of skills, one of which being how to budget correctly. 
2867	Here, they can employ what they learned in their math class in order to help them out with their finances by figuring out how much things will cost and what percentages of their money will have to go to which necessity. Again, this applies to everyone, as students who don't have that opportunity still get the chance to apply their math abilities to their own lives, as they might want to figure out how to divide up their paychecks from their summer job between spending and saving money. 
2868	These examples highlight another main benefit of letting students design their own summer projects, that being the increased opportunities that are availible outside of the classroom. 
2869	Instead of having one general project assigned by the teacher that is monotonus and isn't any different than regular school, students can customize their learning to their specific situation and access things that aren't availible inside the classroom. Students that are interested in making music can apply for internships at music studios that have nicer equipment than their school. Students that enjoy writing can work with local journalists and get a feel for what writing is like for a bigger publication than just their school paper. 
2870	"One might be thinking at this point, ""Come on now. This is great for all the kids who are motivated to learn and are enough of a go-getter to go out and do this stuff, but what about the ones who just want to sit inside and play video games or hang out with their friends?"" "
2871	This is where the real beauty of student-designed work comes in. Even those who don't want to have to sacrifice their precious three months of freedom can still get in valuable time applying what they learned the previous school year. 
2872	Spend your summer days inside playing video games? Calculate your win rate or determine your average time taken to complete certain levels. Prefer to hang out with your buddies at the pool all day? Determie your arc in the air doing different tricks off the diving board. The ability to adapt one's schedule to their situation is infinitely better than doing some general assignment handed out by a teacher, for all types of people. 
2873	If students can create their own project that is specific to their life over the summer, then they are accomplishing several goals. It allows them to actually get the work done, instead of being unable to do so based off of their schedule. It lets them be interested in their learning instead of complaining about a boring stack of worksheets that that have to robotically complete. Most importantly, however, it gives them the chance to experience things outside of the classroom that are both personalized to their lives and also accomplishing their teacher's goal of getting them to continue to learn information, ensuring that student-designed projects present the best of both worlds. 
2874	For students who may receive lots of homework, having to do extracurricular activities, other things at home, and the homework can cause stress and also cause students to stay up late and lose sleep time. With all of this, the students could possibly forget about their homework and their grades will drop because of it. With all of these things, the students won't have time to relax at home after a long day. Without proper sleep at night, the students could fall asleep in class and get in trouble. The cycle will continue and the students in the school won't be attentive enough to learn anything in their classes.  
2875	but the students should have freedom over what they do. At least, if anything, contact the students' parents and ask them for approval. Don't just force them to, though, because it's not right to force students to participate in any activities that they aren't interested in doing. With this, I believe that the students should have the freedom to choose and not have to participate in any activity if they aren't intrigued. 
2876	I strongly disagree with the idea of making all students participate in extracurricular activities. If the students want to participate, then they can. If they don't want to participate or join, then they shouldn't have to. With how crowded it would be, the loss of homework time it would bring, and stress causing it would create, I don't believe that students should be forced into that. I believe the students should be given the choice, and if some of them don't accept, try to convince others. Instead of making them all participate, ask them what activities they like and improve the clubs or create new clubs based on their opinions 
2877	Each year there are approximately 1.6 million car accidents throughout the United States. Many of those are accidents due to texting and driving, almost 400,000 injuries a year. This means 1 out of 4 car accidents are due to distractions while texting and driving. There is an average of 3287 deaths a day, just by usage of cellphones while driving. Stats show that the average age of accidents occur during young ages 17-30 years of age. In a survey, people were asked how many people text and drive and their answer was pretty shocking reporting more than 80% of the people has or done while driving.  
2878	Some of the reasons why people think its a good thing is because they feel the need to be communicated with the world just in case something bad happens or basically if something bad happens on their way and feels the need to communicate it with someone or has an emergency. 
2879	You would imagine that being on a phone call would be top 3 or 5, but it's not that commun seeing people on a phone call. One of the main reasons it's obviously texting. Another big reason is facebook, snapchat, any social media. A big reason is the camera, women just be taking pictures or videos of themselves, while on the other side guys have the trend to speed, or drive recklessly and record it to show it off. You also have people who find it entertaining to shop online or be reading the news as well as checking the weather. When people are really bored while driving or get stuck in traffic for a long period of time they are also watching videos or even movies. 
2880	I loved the opportunity to become a seagoing cowboy, even if it was for a short period of time. I was able to learn animal body language and more about how to take care of the animals. I was able to see many great things like the castle in Crete and the Panama Canal. I also learned about culture in many other countries and some of the hardships of living there. The trips made me more aware of the hardships every person in other countries face every, single day of their lives. I hope that all of these reasons convinced you to become a seagoing cowboy.     
2881	It is able to distinguish individual expressions such as happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness which humans can find hard to do making it vital to being infused into the use of schools. 
2882	Teachers would be able to learn more of their students and improve on their curriculums in order to satisfy the needs of their students. 
2883	see whether they understand the lesson or not making the machine essential to school life. 
2884	"They may lie about not doing their homework or be untruthful about whether they were involved in a fight. The FACS machine could solve that issue as it is able to determine whether someone is lying or not based on their expression which is stated in the quote,"" To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."" This machine is able to examine the details of one's face to find out if they are lying or not. It examines the key traits of each specific emotion and if they are not meant, that is how it knows whther the truth has been told or not. Students will no longer bee able to weasel their way out of punishment due to their superior lying skills as the FACS machine is able to see through the lies. This is not the only thing this machine can do though for schools. "
2885	This mechanism is able to determine the emotions of a student and see if they need help or not. 
2886	"It can read a total of six emotions with some branches coming off of those emotions. The six emotions are stated in the quote,"" Eckman has classified six basic emotions - happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness - and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles."" The machine is able to determine whether a student is in distress or not thus telling the teacher to help the student out with the problem that they are facing. The teacher would be able to help the student cope and deal with their emotional sadness or anger and tell them how to deal with it in order to assist them in getting through it. This is not the end though of what this incredible machine can do for a school. "
2887	"SInce humans find the task of reading emotions diffficult, a teacher may not be able to see this and help the student out but this machine can deal with that problem too. How the machine deals with this horrible issue is state in the statement,"" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts. Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This quote shows how the FACS mechanism would be able to tell if a student is bored which would signal the teacher to modiffy the lesson in order for it to be better understood. Students would no longer have to complain about not understanding their homework or curriculum. This would allow for better grades and better lives for the students in the future. "
2888	In conclusion, the FACS machine would be essential to the lives of students in a classroom. Teachers would b able to make the experience of school even better than it is already and easier than it is already. No student would have to struggle anymore which is key to the success of a school as everyone would learn greatly and effecttively. The machine would deal with the problems of whether a student is telling the truth or not, whether a student is in need of emotional support or not, and whether a student needs help understanding the curriculum and lesson that they are learning. 
2889	Have you ever wondered where your best friend was when he or she wasn't on the bus? Chances are there doing something they find interesting at an extracurricular activity. For instance A sport, yearbook club, or even student council. These are all examples of after school activities or extracurricular activities. 
2890	Partaking in extracurricular activities is a fun way to get yourself involved in doing something you like or trying something new if that thing interests you. Personally I'm all for it, I think that having extracurricular activities is fun and can even be something new. 
2891	You can always assume the worst and get the best. When I was in elementary school I thought doing chess club was going to be boring, but I actually learned lot of skills from doing that club and I made a lot of good friends that I still have today. I expected it to be boring and it turned out to be an amazing experience. Personally I always watched others and my own brother do theater for a while, and I finally said to myself in sixth grade to try it out. I had heard of it but never tried it I signed up and 5 months later fell in love. It was one of the most fun things I had ever done! Now this is my last year but if I hadn't tried it who knows where I would be right now. When my best friend was nervous about keyboarding club because he thought he couldn't type fast he didn't even want to sign up so I told him that if he doesn't like it he can quit and try something different, and so he tried it and it turned out that he liked it but didn't want to continue, so he quit and tried robotics and then he loved it. He said it was trial and error and thats true. Having to do one club is fine and if while choosing one it doesn't fit you can always try a different one. In the end trying something new can be a challenge but at the end of the day if the end result isn't what you want you can always try something new. 
2892	I'm in my last year of middle school and my sister is in her last year of Elementary school, we have a lot of differences and when it comes to taste in activities we differ from each other opinions, but we've always loved doing clubs when we were in the same school. She always loved mixing things and stirring and combining things, and on the other hand I always liked going out and playing sports and trying to get better, we moved schools and we were afraid they may not have our go to options but then we realized they had lots of variety and my sister and I knew that we would be happy there. Picking one thing out of so many different options can be hard but with variety there aren't very many repeats of the same thing, thats why when you choose something that interests you its the only thing there of its category, most likely because there are so many other options that theres no real reason for it to exist again and be the same thing. This happened to my mom when she was younger there was no real variety there were only 2-3 options to choose from and that was that. Nowadays when I'm choosing after school activities she tells me be wise because when she was younger she had barely as many as I do today. In the grand total you can always find something you'll like because of variety. 
2893	Sometimes extracurricular activities can help you realize what you really like to do, but it can also help you find and make friends who have the same interests as you. 
2894	When I brought up going to chess club earlier I thought that I would dread it but it turned out to be super fun. I also met some of my best friends that I still talk to today, they were super inviting and had a passion for the game and enjoyed it. I had never seen anyone enjoy a game that much. When thinking about it, it seems like a very funny and interesting story how you met your friends but when I talk to some kids they tell me that they met their best friends of today by simply sharing the same interests and that is a great way to make friends. When going to a certain activity you go because you enjoy that one thing, well the other people there also enjoy that activity and now you know a whole bunch of people who share a common interest with you. sometimes even the smallest things can spark a friendship maybe you and someone play the same position on a sports team that can be a great reason to be friends or to even talk, doing extra curricular activities gets you out of your comfort zone and makes you feel just open and wanting to talk to people. When going to a certain activity thinking of how the people there are gonna act is a huge thing but most likely the environment is very welcoming and it makes you want to keep doing that one thing with the same people because of how they treated you. In conclusion making friends is a big deal and doing an extracurricular activity can play a huge role and help with making friends. 
2895	My first reason on why I agree and think that doing at least one extracurricular activity will help you is because signing up for something you've never heard of or tried seems like a big challenge, but in the end you might really like it or feel like it suited you. My second reason was that theres always a good variety of activitys to do that you really enjoy or might want to do and this goes without saying but having a lot of different choices of specific things will help you narrow down your choices. My third reason is that you can make a lot of friends and have a very long and fun lasting relationship with people that you shared a common interest with. I believe that doing one extracurricular activity isn't a bad thing but a helpful thing to have in your life. In conclusion trying something new can always be fun and inviting.  
2896	In this sense the project that would be designed by a student most student would have no idea where to start discouraging them for even commencing the project and of course there will be people that can do the project easily but we want to make the project fair and equal for everybody. 
2897	the better option are teacher-designed assignments. These summer projects are better structured because the teachers have received and education on how to teach adolescents, they understand where a student needs to be in their learning, and allow the individual to explore a subject that they previously didn't know about. This structure is also beneficial because it doesn't allow the student to create anything that isn't challenging and even makes it easier on the teacher with grading. For these reasons, summer assignments should be designed by teachers and not the students. 
2898	The projects assigned to the students during the summer should be designed by teachers 
2899	Teachers know all the requirements that a student needs to excel in their class. 
2900	If a student designs the project he or she will make it to the ability where it is easy on them instead of actually learning from the project. 
2901	 Every year many teachers have lesson plans that they go by to get their students to the requirements needed to pass their class. When a teacher assigns a project during the summer it is to prepare the student for the upcoming year. A teacher designs the project in a certain way where the student can obtain information during the summer instead of forgetting it completely. For example, a history teacher assigns a summer project every year. He assigns it so his students can be prepared for the first lesson that he is going to go over. He wants his students to have background information about the material for better understanding. The project could actually be very helpful because instead of going into the class not knowing anything at all a student can at least go with the information he or she learned from doing the summer project 
2902	The projects designed by the teachers in the summer are to help a students achieve great things in their class. 
2903	If a student was able to design his or her own summer project, it will probably lead to them not getting any information from it at all. 
2904	A student does not know all the requirements needed for their upcoming class. The student will probably create the project where it is less work on themselves. Not many students want to do work during their summer break. Many students already do not even want a summer project assigned. I had a chance to create my own project during the summer one year for my English class; it did not turn out very well. I created the project where I did not have to do a ton of work on it because it was my summer break, and I wanted to enjoy it. The reason why it did not turn out well because I created the project with not enough for information because I did not want to waste my time on a summer project. Which also leaded to me not learning anything from it at all. When the first day of class came I knew absolutely nothing that my teacher was talking about. Then realized If my teacher had created the summer project I feel like I would of obtained way more information because she knows all the goals that need to be reached to succeed in her class. 
2905	Many students believe that they should be able to design their own summer projects because they feel like they should have a chance to assign themselves something that they are actually interested in 
2906	However, it is better for a teacher to design the summer project because the teacher knows all the information that a student needs to be successful in their class. It is better for a student to have information about what they actually need to know to pass the class than something that just interests them.  
2907	I must say that, in my opinion The Face on Mars is indeed NOT created by aliens. It is simply illogical. 
2908	Firstly, the picture taken in 2001 is solid proof, as well as the 1998 picture. 
2909	Both seem to resemble a simple mesa, a natural landform quite common on Mars. The 1998 photograph was slightly blurry, so three years later Michael Malin and his crew returned to the Red Planet, to the Cydonia region. Mr. Malin set the Mars Global Surveyor camera to maximum resolution, and snapped an excellent picture from above the Face. And, going even further, I will point out that each pixel in the 2001 photograph spans1.56 meters, as the Viking I's 1976 photo spans 43 meters per pixel. As you can see, this is a significant difference and must not be overlooked. 
2910	Also, I will point out that, in 1976, we at NASA were still relatively new to venturing beyond Earth's orbit. 
2911	The Apollo 11 mission was just seven years old! To attach a high-powered camera to a space shuttle was very challenging at the time. I still hold to my belief that, during the 1976 mission, it was either the fault of the Viking I for holding a bad angle for the camera and causing blurriness, or the camera's fault for simply not being powerful enough. The 1976 photo spans just 43 meters per pixel, which at the time was a very high resolution, but now is considered very low. All in all, the Viking I photo of the Face on Mars is forty years old and must not be taken as seriously as it once was. 
2912	"I find it highly unrealistic that NASA would even have been able to determine what the Face was forty years ago, much less hiding a discovery of extra-terrestrial life that could make a huge profit for the space program. And, had NASA really claimed that the Face was an object built by otherworldly life, surely someone would let the cat out of the bag. Not to mention that, if the vast majority of NASA believed it was an alien monument, do you really think that they would wait eighteen years to investigate the subject again? On top of all of this, it's simply illogical that aliens would create such a thing. As far as we all know, the supposed ""aliens"" on Mars have never come in contact with a human, much less seen one. That only leaves possible explanation; aliens created a monument that of which coincedentally resembles a human head. An absolute coincedence. "
2913	Are you ready to accept the truth about the Face on Mars? I have listed valid, credible arguments including the high resolution of the 2001 photo, and the weak resolution of the 1976 photo. I also questioned the logic of extra-terrestrial life, and the logic that NASA would have used to cope with the discovery of aliens. 
2914	The author presents a strong argument suggesting a worthy pursuit to study Venus depsite dangerous endeavors, however, his statments regauarding un-reliability on current technology, the necessary actions to conduct research, and numerous failed attempts to reach Venus greatly outweigh the good outcomes of this mission. 
2915	Venus is considered the planet that is most similar to Earth. The passage explained that scientist speculate if there was once life on Venus considering it incredible geographical and size similarities to earth. 
2916	Although further research could test their theories, Venus has very extreme weather conditions harmul to man and other objects. 
2917	A closer look and gathering of evidence is expected to make this mission a success. 
2918	However, modern day technology is barely able to keep up efficiently by just the use of humans. 
2919	These issues are far too risky to consider pursuing.  
2920	Venus has features such as mountains, craters, and even valleys that are also seen on Earth. According to the article, its atmosphere is 97% carbon dioxide with temperatures averging 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than Earth with can crush nearly anything that tries to reach its surface and even liquefy metals. The second paragraph discussed how spacecrafts in the past barely lasted a few hours and since there hasn't been a spacecraft sent there in more than three decades. This evidence shows that despite the success of reaching Venus, we are not even close to even slowly progressing and fixing smaller issues with spacecrafts traveling there and back to Earth. 
2921	By not providing evidence of some sort of pregression or steps closer to considering sending humans to Venus, the author weakens his arguments over the better outcomes of conducting research.  
2922	"Conducting research requires numerous forms of evidence, samples, test, etc. In paragraph 5, the author makes suggestions of creating a spacecraft to sustain temperatures of at least 170 degrees Fahrenheit and levitating thirty-plus miles over the surface to observe the planet. Although this may be the most safest and efficient approach, he even stated that it would require getting ""up close and personal"" to collect samples. The whole idea is to reach Venus and collect data to compare to Earth and Venus' previous history. "
2923	Without being able to collect samples, the author weakens his argument to study Venus despite the dangers it presents. 
2924	"Lastly, modern day technology is known for its speed and cinvenience to access information. In paragraph 7, the author discussed how electronics we simplified to last at least three weeks in simulating conditions to Venus. He explained, ""modern computers...tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physicakl conditions."" He supported this claim by informing readers that older technology, mechanical computers, have been re-evaluated and seem to have better calculations but involve levers and such. "
2925	This weakens his argument because it would mean that this mission wouldn'tt be helpful if the right technology can't be utilized to help calculate and evalutate information. 
2926	All in all, the author makes very good claims as to why NASA should continue to pursue further research on Venus. It would help determine if there was previous life, if it once operated as successful as earth, and if Earth could potentially be headed in the same direction. However, the extreme weather conditions, actions necessary for research, and un-cooperative technology make this pursuit seem far less worth it considering how danger it is for humans and even the spacecrafts sent to examine the planet. Ultimately, the project can be deemed as impossible if facts given in the article remain the same.   
2927	New software has been created to determine the facial expressions of students. It uses technology to give data as to what emotions someone is feeling such as happiness, sadness, and boredom. These technologies are possibly going to be used in classrooms to help students learn better based on their emotions towards the lesson that they are learning. 
2928	To start, in order for this new technology to work, students woukld have to constantly be watched by cameras that read their expressions. 
2929	"This is said in the text when it says, ""Using imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements,"" (D'Alto 4). One can see from this that the students would always have to be watched and their facial movements would all be recorded. This could be an issue of privacy for some students if they do not want to constantly be recorded. It also makes it easy for outside threats to hack this system and watch students or get personal information from the videos. "
2930	Emotion-recognition software can also be expensive for schools, especially since it doesnt work on normal PC computers. 
2931	"The text states, "" Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile,"" (D'Alto 7). This shows that normal computers that students would typically use cannot support this technology, making the school buy the technology that can support it. This would be a costly job and if the school cannot pay for it then the students would have to and some families may not be able to afford it "
2932	Lastly, students facial expressions may not directly correlate with the emotion they are feeling towards the lesson that they are learning. 
2933	"This can be seen in the text when it says, "" A classroom computer could recognize when a stuent is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr Huang predicts. ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor,"""" (D'Alto 6). This exemplifies that the schools want to use this technology to help students learn more effectively by using technology thats like a teacher. For some students this may cause trouble if they make facial expressions, but it's not about the lesson. Such as if a student is told something by another student and the student looks confused, the computer might see that and think they dont understand the lesson. Then it would modify the lesson for the student even if the student understood it just fine. A teacher would be much better at understanding the students emotions in a certain situation than technology. "
2934	Students need to be able to learn on their own and to communicate with teachers on how well they´re understanding what they´re learning. By using facial recognition technology, its taking away their communication skills. There are many flaws to the facial-expression technology that make it a bad candidate to use in schools. It´s certain that there are plenty of good uses for facial expression technology, however using it in schools is not one of them. 
2935	Summers can be the best times of a students life. They get a break from the stress and anxiety of school and they are allowed to do any and all things they wish to do within the legal limits. Summer projects are designed to keep students engaged and learning. This can be a very good thing as long as the project is based on a topic that the student actually enjoys and will be motivated to complete. Students struggle staying engaged enough during the school year, adding a project during the time they are meant to go be kids should be handled very carefully. 
2936	If they want the projects to be successful they must set a broad topic and allow the students to chose anything they want under that umbrella topic. 
2937	This will keep them interested in the project which will make all the grades of the projects go up compared to if it was a topic they have no interest in. 
2938	Projects picked by a student may even result in more knowledge being gained than a teacher assigned project. 
2939	Students could focus on a sports team and how they network their team to different audiences in different ways. For example, mascots are normally focused on the younger audience. Teams almost always have a promotion for the first certain number of people that arrive. The first one thousand people to go through the security gates get a free t-shirt or the first fifty fans to arrive get a jersey. Marketing and understanding how to focus products to a certain group of people is so important. My dream school, Virginia Tech, has promotions every basketball game that if the opposing team misses two free throws in a row the entire crowd gets a voucher for free bacon. This encourages all Hokie fans to be as loud as possible to mess with the mental mindset of the opposing teams shooter. A majority of jobs and careers that are pursued must have a way of marketing or selling their product so this is a very important skill for kids to have that they would not other wise be able to understand if they had to read a Shakespeare book followed by a five pager paper. 
2940	Having a teacher assigned project does have an upside 
2941	This will give the students structure and something to base their project on instead of having all the options in the world and not being able to choose one. In school, students are normally more prepared if it is a topic they have been learning about and have background knowledge on compared to a project half way through a topic, or even towards the beginning. If students are given a short book or even a PowerPoint on the topic at hand they will be more successful in completing their project. 
2942	A student lead project during the summer is a great thing it keeps the mind or a student engaged with out boring them. Students can research any and all topics they would like so that they enjoy keeping their brain working and focused on bettering themselves. Teacher based projects will give the students structure but will leave them feeling not engaged because the topic is not something they will necessarily enjoy. The idea of a student based project is a good idea and should be created to help the minds and bodies of the students.                                
2943	Their are ways to get around the struggle of making them mandatory by making them optional or asking our teachers if we are ready for them. 
2944	"like its says in paragraph 6 ""Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad"". For example if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen a similar ad might follow. But if you frown the next ad will be different ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored ""Most human communication is nonverbal including emotional communication"" noted Dr. Huang ""So computers need to understand that too "
2945	Driving while operating your phone can end in a very horrific way and has for a number of young adults. The number one killer of young adults is motor vehicle crashes. This is a major issue in the United States and it is shown because a law was made to prevent operating a phone and driving. For example, there are billboards everywhere saying no texting and driving and commercials saying the same. Texting and driving may seem tempting to do, but every year thousands of drivers and passengers are killed due to someone being on their phone and driving. It only takes a couple of seconds for you to take your eyes off the road and someone can swerve in your lane or you swerve in someone else's lane and didn't notice because you are texting someone back or looking at a notification. 
2946	Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while driving because in a matter of seconds you, your family or someone else's life could be put in danger or worse, taken away.  
2947	"Secondly, ""In 2018 according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, distracted driving was involved in 2,841 motor vehicle crash fatalities. "
2948	"Among those killed: 1,730 drivers, 605 passengers, 400 pedestrians and 77 bicyclists."" All these deaths could have been avoided if the person could have just waited until they stopped or until they got to their destination. Your parents tell you to text or call before you start driving for a reason so they won't lose their child or see their child hurt. ""Cell phone use behind the wheel reduces the amount of brain activity associated with driving by 37 percent."" So this shows that texting can make you forget important things you are supposed to do before or while driving. "
2949	"Lastly, ""Typing text messages reduces a driver's ability to adequately direct attention to the roadway, to respond to important traffic events, and to control a vehicle within a lane and with respect to other vehicles."" "
2950	This shows that the couple of seconds you take to text or look at your phone can take away the attention you are required to have on the road to ensure safety. Texting while driving could make you miss that there is construction going on, someone is walking, or etc. Parents should not call while their children are driving, they should call before or after they arrive at their destination. If their child is called he is going to look at their phone and some might answer, but all it could take is a look and boom the car goes into another lane or they hit someone or another car. 
2951	Basketballs get thrown around, paint splashes onto paper and adolescence start to open up their minds to logical thinking. 
2952	they help students release stress 
2953	help thinking in a new way 
2954	makes school enthralling to those who have not been blessed with natural intelligence. 
2955	A long day of tiring work builds up unnecessary stress. Students are packed with homework in subjects they may not enjoy. To end their day with an activity they enjoy can make a horrific day into an enthralling experience; for example, majority of people like spending time with others who they have things in common with. Growing up, it was hard for me to socialize, it felt as if everyone else was functioning faster than Ic was. After a day that felt as if the human population was filled with nothing but sorrow, I finally got to go home and feel the crystal clear water cool my body down, as my team practiced steadily for our swim competition. 
2956	In the school I have attended for junior high, I am required to take classes that focus on music. In the sixth grade, I chose orchestra because it was an amusing experience to see how one movement in my wrist could cause a pleasant noise to be heard throughout the room. In my science class, we had moved on to the sound unit and i excelled while many other students did not. When my science teacher used words such as octaves, pitch, and harmony it wasn't difficult to understand. 
2957	One of the many symptoms of depression is memory loss. Since my mother had suffered from the illness, it was genetically passed down to me. Even as a child it was clear to me that school was mainly about memorization. When teachers talked about how we had learned topics in prior years my brain scattered through the many memories in my head but was unable to remember anything. Extracurricular activities aren't about your ability to memorize, but your motivation to excel. 
2958	Activities a student enjoys can introduce them to experiences they didn't know were possible. Extracurricular activities help students release stress from the hardships of their day, show them a way to think that they haven't seen before, and is beneficial for those who believe they are not intelligent. I believe that they would be helpful to students and help them excel in the future and should be required in schools. 
2959	They should be designed by students, they can choose a topic that they would prefer or something that isn't too hard on them. 
2960	Sometimes teachers assign work that is difficult for students to complete, and without a teachers help during the summer you could be lost with the directions they give you. 
2961	Teachers could give out a really confusing rubric for the project, a student might not understand what they must do to meet the proper criteria for the project. The teacher is out for summer break too, they probably dont have the time to check their e-mail constantly to help you out when your stuck so if students would design their own projects they wouldnt have the stress and hardship of a teacher designed project. 
2962	If students could design their own projects they would be able to work freely without a confusing rubric and the trouble of having to wait for a teacher to e-mail you back 
2963	Not all students want to be told by teachers to make a diorama or make a poster, some students dont have the time or resources for that, If its the summer then students want to be out on vacation, helping out their parents, or getting jobs. If they could create a project that doesnt interfere with that then that would be great for them. If they are able to manage their time then they can take time making a project instead of rushing through it to get it done in what little time they have. 
2964	But assigning this task to students is a great way for them to show their work ethic, 
2965	Student designed projects are also a great way for students to be creative and to show their creativity. 
2966	If all the students were assigned a project on the same exact topic, many of them will turn the same exact projects in. But if they were able to have creative control then they can diversify their projects, lets say you were assigned a history project, this project was about photosynthesis, Many students would turn in a plant cell thats labeled with all the parts of the cell and then they would either label a paper with how plants photosynthesize or why they do it. Most if not all of the projects would be similar, unless they were able to choose them on their own. If they could choose they could do a project on How the Rocky Mountains were formed, or how active the Ring of Fire is. Then the projects would be more interesting to not only the teacher but the students. 
2967	 Another reason on why students should have the freedom to create their own projects is that they wouldnt have been assigned a project that they find boring, 
2968	The chances are if a student is bored with their work, they are not going to do a good job on it. They didnt have the motivation of learning or finding it interesting, they just simply want to get it done and over with. But if they do a project they find interesting, not only could they be happy with their work but they would would most likely preform a better job than if they didnt. Not only would they be satisfied with being able to have freedom over their work, but they would be satisfied with the work they put into it. 
2969	Imagine growing up in a city 30 miles above the ground and wearing a suit all the time to protect yourself from the envirement. This is life on the planet of Venus. There are many dangers such as the temperature being 800 degrees Fahrenheit, the pressure that is 90 times greater than what we experience on earth, and clouds of sulfuric acid everywhere but is it worth it?  
2970	Life would be a lot more difficult living on Venus but based on this article it might just be possible 
2971	However allowing students to design their own projects will allow them to challege themselfes . They will also probley pick a project that is enjoybal to them and will make the learning experiance so much better and the students will most likely complte a project they ejoy doing. Also allowing students to design their own project wont make them be careless it will allow them to make adult choices on their own . This being said will show how much they are growing up and how they can make good choices on their own and how they can do it by themselfs . Allowing them to pick it will mostlikly make them make better choices much rather then carless ones . 
2972	The design of what project the students are given in the summer should completly be their own design not the teachers. If the students design their own projects they will mostlikley do something they like . If they do something that they like they will get it done and the learning experiance will be so much better then if the teacher designed what the students where told to do over the summer . It being said if the students where able to design the project they would enjoy it and be able to get all supplies they need for it because the teacher might pick something the student might not like or something they cant get supplies for. They would also probaly love to be told they have a project to do over the summer if it was their design and get it done. So overall students should be allowed to design their own projects so they can learn more in the summer.  
2973	Smog, backed up traffic ways, and stress seem to be the main factor contributing to the decrease in car usage. Although these seem to be very negative factors, there are many advantages to limiting car use including helping our Planet Earth and less costly factors. 
2974	when we look at studies we find that when people use their cars immensely, there is a harmful effect in our atmosphere, also reffered to as The Greenhouse Effect. 
2975	This movement is also spreading to places such as Bogota, Colombia where they have a day free of cars with the exception of taxis and buses; 
2976	Buying cars over the years has become quite an expense to everyone and has become somewhat burden-like. By limiting and even canceling out the use of cars people have cut down expenses greatly. 
2977	"Public transportation is getting on board with this idea and trying to accomodate those who have made this decision by making public transit ""free of charge from Friday to Monday,"" according to the BBC in the article  Paris bans driving due to smog . As also mentioned the importance of car is no longer such an immediate thought to people more recently.  Elisabeth Rosenthal solidifies this in the article  The End of Car Culture when she includes ""recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."" This clear and simple states that people are not considering their cars as such an extreme item and more considering it as a means of transportation only when absolutely necessary such as when ""Bay Area Rapid Transit doesn't work."" As well costs not only personally so much as federally are being affected dramatically. Elisabeth Rosenthal author of In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars explains ""In previous bills, 80 percent of appropriations have by law gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport."" By intorducing this idea, people are aware that the advantage is personal and is in the everyday common person's favor.  "
2978	Not only are the advantages of limiting car usage subtle however they are also direct and can have immediate positive effects on people. By making sure people do not overdo the amount they utilize their cars, they become less stressed, have a healthier environment, and save money. This issue is worldwide however, the solution is becoming worldwide as well creating exceptional results and care from car drivers and people are really thinking outside of the box to make magic happen. 
2979	"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author explains how certain algorithms built into a system, called the Facial Action Coding System, can detect human emotions. In the article, the author describes how a classroom computer can recognize when a student is getting bored or confused based on their facial expressions. This computer can change the way that the lesson is being taught so that the students are more productive in classes. "
2980	While the Facial Action Coding System detects facial expressions that indicate a person's emotion, the system built in a classroom computer is valuable to students, because it can manipulate the lesson based on how students are learning. 
2981	The ability to have a classroom computer that is able to read the emotional expressions of students, would be very valuable is a classroom, because it allows the lesson to be taught in a way that would benefit the students, according to Dr. Huang 
2982	In a normal classroom, teachers create lessons that confuse the students or do not appeal to their learning ability which creates a tension for the learning environment. With the use of this technology, classroom lessons would be more educational and responsive. This is because, the technology is able to recognize when a student is confused or bored by reading their emotional and facial expressions. This is useful since the system can alter a lesson plan to be suitable for the students in the classroom which would potentially help them learn better. For example, if a student is confused during class, it is likely that they will not ask for help, leading them to not understand what is going on in the lesson. Having this technology in the classroom, would sense this and modify the lesson so that a student would be able to learn better and understand the topics. 
2983	The use of the Facial Action Coding System in classrooms would be beneficial in classrooms to both the students and the teacher, because it would allow the teacher to adjust lessons in order for more students to understand the concepts. Dr. Huang predicted that the system would be able to manipulate lessons based on the readings of emotional expressions in the classroom. The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable, because it would benefit the student's learning ability in the classroom. 
2984	Students being able to design their own summer projects would not make the project a leaning experience. 
2985	A student would do the project on a topic that he/she already knows about instead of leaning something new because he/she would want to hurry up and go outside to enjoy the summer. For example, if a student already knows about the great depression and has to do a project on the topic about devastating things that has happened to the American economy he/she would write about the great depression because they already know what happened. There would be no need to go the library or research anything or learn something new. Teachers pick projects that will challenge his or her students to excel not only in the specific subject that he/she teaches but in life also. 
2986	Teachers assign projects that will help their students do better in his or her class. 
2987	Teachers pick projects that keep students up to date on what's happening in society. 
2988	Teachers should also pick the summer projects because it teachers student how to follow directions and how to be independent. 
2989	It helps students learn how to only rely on themselves and not anyone else because you can not ask the teacher for help. The student has to learn how to do it themselves which is a skill everyone needs, it also teaches students how to follow directions, teacher gives out a rubric and the students must follow the rubric to get a good grade. If each student designed their own project each project would be different which would be thought for the teacher to grade and come up with a rubric for. 
2990	Teachers should pick the summer reading because they only want what's best for their students. It helps them: learn,stay connected with the world, learn independence, and be an overall great student. If teachers keep picking the summer projects future students will become the important hard working men and women that will eventually run the world. 
2991	so even if they stop just a quarter of them from driving, then that could cut down on a lot of carbon-based emissions. 
2992	Another advantage to having no cars is that we have more people walking or riding their bike. 
2993	For starters, teachers know the curriculum and know what students need to learn, especially for the upcoming school year. 
2994	Teachers can also give an overall theme and provide many mini topics for the students to do their project on to help with creativity and a higher chance of individuality. Teachers can also hand out rubrics for their students to help them stay on track and to let them know what should and what should not be included in their projects. 
2995	Projects designed by teachers can almost always guarantee a student is learning. 
2996	Students do not know it all, so if they were to create their own summer project, it would most likely be based around something that they already know much of; however, if a teacher designed the project, this would insure a way of making sure all students learn something new. Teacher-designed projects are also a way for students to get a taste of what the following school year is going to be like, which can give them a head start. Lastly, if students designed their own projects, the chances of it being organized is slim-to-none; whereas, if teachers designed the projects, it would have a purpose, a flow, and be well organized all at the same time. 
2997	Although some may disagree, teacher-designed summer projects deem to hold much more beneficial qualities over student-designed projects. From keeping an overall theme and being well organized to helping students get a leg-up for the upcoming school year, teacher-designed projects just have a more positive outlook overall. Although student-designed projects seem like a good idea, it will ultimately just turn into a giant, unorganized mess where the students do not even learn anything new. In conclusion, summer projects would be better off if it were designed by teachers. 
2998	"With the information the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" covers, this advancement in technology seems extremely unnecessary and could potentially have negative effects even with the good intentions behind it. "
2999	As far as what is explained in this article the only benefit to this technology is that computers will know what you are feeling, and the question that needs to be asked is; do we really want them to? 
3000	Secondly, there was no mention of how much this kind of technology costs or if it would even be plausible for it to be in a classroom setting. 
3001	Lastly, why is it be necessary for a computer to overtake yet another aspect of a teacher's job of human interaction and communication. 
3002	Although all seems harmless on the forefront of this idea, the side effects could turn very sour very quick. 
3003	"Nick D' Alto says ""Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad."" The author of this article talks of how it will improve ad placements by whether you smile or frown, however I know for a fact social medias, especially Facebook, are already basing information on preferable ads by just what material you look at. Why is it necessary for a program to constantly scan our face just to see if we like something or not? This gives the computer so much power of constantly knowing what your exact emotions are on everything. It is just so unnecessary that it causes one to question why in the world would we risk giving computers that kind of power. Also, is it appropiate to constantly scan childrens' faces as they are trying to learn? Would there be a security system in place or parental agreement necessary that would allow the permission of constant invasion of privacy in the name of education? There are many ethical questions and unknown future outlooks that one would not want to subject children to that sort of test of safety and security. "
3004	However if this technology was to be used in a classroom, the next question is of course the cost of such a new computer process. 
3005	All computers would have to have facial recognition in their system and although there is no mention of cost in the article one can imagine that this new technology is not cheap. Is it realistic to expect that schools will pay great amounts of tax payers dollars just so that we can invade the privacy of our children to figure out if they are bored? It seems much more financially sound to not steal the jobs of millions of teachers and let them get to know their students, opposed to scanning their face. 
3006	Teachers are necessary in the classroom not only to impart knowledge but also to make those personal connections that tell them how to best teach their kids. 
3007	Every student is different, learns a different way and reacts differently to every aspect of the classroom. The article says a computer will be able to detect if a student is bored, but teachers have that ability already, minus the cost and invasion of privacy. Teachers are in the classroom so that they can make those personal connections with each student and ensure that they are doing everything they can to provide the best education possible. If a computer detects boredom it will just try another lesson without knowing what is best for the student. So the question that needs to be asked is why would this sort of technology be useful in the classroom? 
3008	I'm sure most students would agree that teachers really know how to put you to work, while that sounds like a bad thing, it's actually very helpful. Teachers know how to drill information into a student's brain. However, I do understand why students would want to be in charge of organizing summer projects. Students want projects to be fun and easy, usually with as little work as possible, as to where teachers would more than likely want as much work as possible 
3009	Sure it can be difficult but, there are many reasons why teacher-designed summer projects would work better. 
3010	Because teachers are more experienced with designing summer projects, they know what is needed to help students construct a great project. 
3011	Teachers can also assist in giving pointers to how students can be more engaged with their projects. 
3012	As difficult as it might seem, the challenges that teachers set for students, actually help benefit in teaching students the material.  
3013	Teachers have organized many summer projects throughout their years of teaching. They are more qualified to organize them because, they know what material students struggle with and they know how to make the information stick. 
3014	Teachers have lots of experience with helping students create summer projects, therefore, should be the people who organize them. While the work may seem tedious and difficult at times, teachers are simply just trying to assist in helping you gain the knowledge and understand it. By giving students a lot of work, teachers are helping them learn not only the information being attained from the project but also, how to manage their time efficiently. Teachers understand that when students are working in a time frame, they have a better understanding of how to manage their time to work efficiently and get everything done before the due date. Experienced teachers can guide students in how to manage their time, get everything done, and still have time to spare. It is because of experienced teachers that students have been able to construct outstanding summer projects. 
3015	If a student is engaged, they are more likely to succeed. Teachers engage students by designing summer projects in a way that interests them. A student who is engaged in their project is more likely to receive a good grade than a student who showed no interest in it at all. Teachers typically try to stick to things that inspire all students equally, they try not to lean towards a specific influence as to remain unbiased. Students have many different interests which is why student-organized projects would be beneficial. A teacher with a good understanding of their student's likes and dislikes can better organize a project that will help students be engaged. Keeping students engaged is a difficult, but manageable, task and while not every teacher can do it, they all try. 
3016	Challenges can motivate students into working their hardest and trying their best. While some may argue that challenging work actually causes students to be less inclined to do summer projects, it actually motivates them more. Statistics show that students who are challenged receive better grades than those who are not. If students were to organize a summer project, they would more than likely leave out any form of a challenge, students would much rather have free time than work on a summer project and that would lead to students designing an easy summer project that requires little effort. Teachers on the other hand, give students lots of work so they can gain the information in a much better way. Summer projects aren't made to take up all your free time, they are made to make sure the information that was being taught during school actually stuck and that students fully understand it. Teachers who challenge their students are the teachers with the highest passing scores.  
3017	Teachers can organize a summer project better than students because they are highly experienced in doing so. Teachers find ways to engage and challenge their students which leads to a higher passing rate. So while student-designed projects can be fun and easy, it's more effective when summer projects are teacher-designed. The biggest problem with teacher-designed projects is that not every teacher or student is the same, However teacher-designed projects are said to be more successful than student-designed projects. They are not always fun, but they are always effective. Teachers are always working to help students gain information and be successful in life. So next time you have a summer project and you want it to be student-designed, think about all the things your teachers do to make sure you are going to be successful. It isn't supposed to be easy, and it isn't always going to be fun, but as long as you learn the information, it will always be beneficial. 
3018	Summer assignments are required by a multitude of schools accross the state of Virginia. But some school districts are considering breaking from the traditional teacher-designed summer projects and instead replacing them with projects designed by the students 
3019	This may reflect student desires, however, it does not reflect what is best for the students education. Summer projects should be designed by teachers rather than students because it would be in the students own best interest. 
3020	Summer projects are intended to be used as preparation for courses students are going to take in the upcoming school year 
3021	Therefore, how could students be sure of what content should be emphasized; what ideas are the most important; and what materials, such as books and web sources, are the best? Furthermore, teachers will have a far greater knowledge of the courses at hand. Often times theachers will have particular material they want to be covered or emphasized over the summer. For instance, many Humanities teachers have specific books that they want students to read. Even though these books may be longer and harder than many students desire, they likely cover crucial material or are written in a certain literary style that is going to be taught about. 
3022	Some may claim that in order to have effective learning, students themselves must control the different components of their eductation. 
3023	While this may be true for some aspects, such as selecting the courses they wish to take, this should not be the case for summer assignments. This is because many students may take advantage of an opportunity to design their own summer projects, by making them as quick and easy as possible. While this may allow students to enjoy their summer break more, it compromises the very objective of summer assignments, that is, to enhance their education through having continuos learning instead of a complete break from school over the summer. 
3024	if teachers were to design summer assginments, they would be far more rigorous, but more importantly, they would be more beneficial for students for the upcoming school year. 
3025	If student-designed projects are too easy, they end up simply becoming busy work. More difficult teacher-designed projects would challenge students, which may seem unappealing to many, however in order to grow academically, students need a stimulus to respond to. Moreover, students become stronger learners when they are forced to overcome challenges. These challenges could include: reading a book in a foreign language; reading a book that is longer than they would like and far more dense than they are used to; or having to perform operations with dificult mathematic equations, formulas, and concepts. Nevertheless these challenges will make students think heavily and help them become better educated. 
3026	Although student-designed summer projects may appeal more to students, they will ultimately privide significantly less benefit to students' education, than teacher-designed projects would. 
3027	The landform is referred to as a Martian mesa, which is common in the region of Cydonia, but this has shadows that make it appear as if the figure has a face. 
3028	The Martian mesa was naturally formed, but with its shadows, it looks much like a face. In 1998 Mars Global Surveyor was close enogh to actually see if there were any alien monuments and turns out that there wasn't any. 
3029	In the end, the landform was found to be a Martian mesa. There are many mesa's in the region of Cydonia and that's a part of how we found out how it was a natural landform. Also the Surveyour verified that there wasn't any other monuments near the landform. If there was any life on Mars we would want to tell the people so they can be intrested in the activity at NASA, but for now there has not been found any life activiy on Mars.   
3030	Have you ever wondered what someone else was feeling on the inside? With the introduction of the Facial Action Coding System; this allows you to do just that by having it interpate someone's facial expressions, and then having it respond back with a variety of emotions from that specific person. 
3031	Firstly, the FACS does not allows students to hide themselves and pretend to be someone they are not. 
3032	"The FACS will pick up emotions that a student is feeling and teachers, parents, and or consoulers will be able to get the help that that particular student aqquires. ""To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling"" politicain or celebrity isn't being truthful."" This same concept can work with students too. If a student is giving off a false emotion than that student really feels; the FACS can determine the actual emotion the student is feeling. If teachers and parents realize the actual feelings and emotions someone feels, he or she will be able to provide more comfort in the act of helping towards that individual. "
3033	Secondly, the Facial Action Coding System can change the way lessons are tought to make them more encaging and exciting for students. 
3034	"If the FACS picks up that students are bored out of their minds; instructors will be able to change the lesson for future students so that they are paying attention and actual learning from the lesson. ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" and ""then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This example from the text illustrates that the FACS will have have a trememdous effect on students' learning capabilities in a good way because with the FACS; instructors can modify their lessons so that students can obtain information better and learn more from their class. If the students are learning more from classes with the effect of FACS; this world will have a brighter future because the students now across American are the world's future, and with brighter students comes a brighter future. "
3035	In conclusion, FACS should be incooperated in all classrooms nation wide because how many times are a kid did you tell you parents at the dinner table that you did not learn anything at school? With the FACS that topic at dinner can be changed because the FACS can modify lessons if the students are bored or confused so that students develop more information in a days work at school. The able to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is also valuble because if a student is struggling with mental problems, rather than being bored or confused, the FACS can detect what he or she is feeling and that particular student can get the help he or she needs to succeed in life. As one can see, the FACS would be an incredible improvement in all classrooms across American and over seas because with the effects of the FACS students will be able to learn and take away more from a lesson than before.  
3036	When I was a Seagoing Cowboy, it opened up the world to me. I saw that the world wasn't all sunshine and rainbows, like the little me thought. The world was full of unfairness and was my job, everybody's job, to help stop it. I stepped up to do my part by joining the Seagoing Cowboys. Do your part. Join the Seagoing Cowboys program today. Make the world a better place, one cow at a time. 
3037	Students should participate in extracurricular activities because it benefits their social, mental and physical health. 
3038	Instead of lazing over homework or moping around their house, children can be brighter and happier to get things done. When students are in an environment they enjoy, it can motivate them and brighten up their day. No one likes sitting in a classroom for seven hours. If students have something exciting to look forward to at the end of the day or the day after, it will push them to get their work done to participate in what they want to do. 
3039	, extracurriculars give students a reason not to stay home and isolate themselves. 
3040	A bunch of children just want to go home and binge shows or movies if they'v got nothing to go to. Especially, when they are bored. School can cause stress, so they'll want to wind down by getting sucked into their electronics. Instead, finding something as relaxing as watching a movie, like drawing, making music, reading, etc. is better for their eyes and won't cause eye induced headaches. But, the only way for them to realize that's what they like, is to expose them to it. 
3041	Fresh air and natural light is good for everyone and wakes people up. Generally, unnatural light causes headaches, tiredness, and is known for making people lose concentration. Being indoors also can cause a trapped or caged feeling because it would be hard to get up and move without disrupting a working environment. Indoor lighting tends to feel dull and drab, not bright and happy. 
3042	When students have a closer similarity (their extracurricular activity) it can give them something in common. 
3043	Having something in common helps people socialize and discuss that topic. Then, children can make friends over things they both like to do and discuss, plus they'll be able to work together on the topic. If the topic they made friends over was a sport, they can become better friends because teammates have to rely on each other during games. Having a sport as an extracurricular activity also gets kids exercising and it's not always a bad thing. 
3044	There are a ton of students who do not get to see their family at all due to school. Students need time to be with their family and socialize with them like playing a board game or having a nice conversation. Extracurricular activities may interfere with the time that kids have to spend with their families. It is very important that kids spend time with their families because it keeps their mental health well, keeps them in line, and provides comfort for them. It keeps their mental health stable because they do not worry about seeing their parents or when they will see their parents again. It keeps them in line because they have somebody to tell them what is ok and what is not ok and they have somebody to discipline them. It provides comfort for kids because they know somebody or some group of people are there for them. If students had no time to spend with their family it would most likely casue many problems for them. 
3045	Did you know that teachers assign kids with loads of homework? If you didn't then now you do. Here at my school I get home and it takes me a couple of hours to get my homework done. I was very disappointed when I was told that every student has to take part in one extracurricular activity. If this time is taken away from students it will take away time for them to do their homework. If kids start not having time to do their homework their grades may drop, which could make them depressed, and it could affect their behavior at school. If a students grade drops their parents may get mad which would make them sad and upset which could lead to them doing something hurtful or bad to themselves. It could also affect their behavior at school by making them not pay attention and start getting into mischief. If students have to stay after-school for an extra activity, it takes away time for homework which kids need to do and if they dont have the time bad things may happen. 
3046	"Even though scientists are aware of these difficult factors, people like the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" still think that being informed about this bright point of light is worth it.  "
3047	Consequently, the author states in paragraph six that there are now many scienstist searching for technology that will be able to stand the harsh conditions in Venus 
3048	"In conclusion, the claim about Venus being a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents that the author of ""The Challenges of Exploring Venus"" states is well supported by facts and perfectly thought out ideas. Although Venus is an extremely dangerous planet packed with many reasons as to why exploration is currently held back, NASA is still looking for ways to be able to gain more valuable insight about the Evening Star. Just like the author said, learning and travelling should not be limited by doubts, and scientists will not let doubts and fears stop them. "
3049	Firstly, driving requires your full attention, but phones compromise this focus. 
3050	You need to keep both hands on the steering wheel to be the most effective driver. But, every time you text, read messages or talk on a cell phone without a hands-free device, not only is your focus compromised, but you can't keep both hands on the wheel. Phone use when you are driving can also affect your alertness of the surroundings, which can make you prone to collisions. Also, distraction and inattention are the number one cause of traffic accidents and it is estimated that nearly every collision involves one of these two related errors. Driving takes all your attention and it is your responsibility to keep your eyes on the road, so put down the phones and pay attention to the road. 
3051	Secondly, people who use a cell phone in the car can drive erratically, which puts others at risk 
3052	They may fail to give the proper signals, miss road signs, change lanes abruptly or respond slowly to hazards. Erratic driving patterns can be extremely dangerous to everyone else on the road, including other drivers, pedestrians, and animals. Also, motorist involved in a stressful or emotional phone conversation may exhibit aggressive behavior while they drive, such as road rage. This may cause the erratic driving to worsen and this greatly increases the chance of causing an accident. So, if checking your phone is going to cause you to get mad and drive like you've got no sense and possibly kill someone, then there's no need in even picking it up. 
3053	 Lastly, there are now legal ramifications when it comes to using phones while driving. 
3054	You can have criminal penalties placed on you such as fines and tickets and depending on if you had an accident and killed someone you may face more serious criminal consequences such as jail time. Driving with a device can cause you to have higher insurance premiums because insurance rates are tied to a driver's driving history and if you get pulled over for using your phone while driving too many times, it could cause your insurance premiums to spike. Also, you can lose your driving privileges because just like your insurance, you accumulate points for your recklessness. So, if you accumulate too many, you can no longer drive. So, unless your like tickets, fines, jail time, or losing your driver's license, I suggest you wait till you get home to check you phone. 
3055	Some of my friends go home and do nothing after school. It can get boring to have nothing to do for the remainder of the day. Participating in an after-school activity can pass time and help you to not be bored, especially if you are participating in an activity you enjoy. When I was in elementary school, I went to an after-school art club so I could pass the time doing something that I liked. I also did after-school soccer in the fourth grade, and I started playing volleyball in the fourth grade. I am still playing volleyball to this day. These kinds of activities can give you something to do instead of going on your phone and doing nothing. I have gotten more productive over the past couple of years because I participate in extracurricular activities. I believe that kids can be more productive, and extracurricular activities are a vital way to achieve this goal. Not only is it a good way to spend your time, but it is also a good way to meet people.  
3056	You share the same interests, and liking the same things as someone else is a good way to bond and socialize with people. I met a lot of people through after-school volleyball, and I am still friends with most of them to this day. Our team would go out to restaurants after our games whether we won or lost because we were friends, and we liked to play together. We all liked playing the sport, so it was easy to make friends with each other. I also met a lot of people through my art club because we liked to draw, and we liked to talk to each other. If you have trouble making friends, you will most likely be able to socialize and bond with others through these events. I met one of my best friends through after-school dance classes when I was in elementary school. We enjoy dancing and listening to music together. Not only are extracurricular activities able to help you get to know people, but they can also help you find your interests. 
3057	For example, I once convinced my sister to play volleyball. She didn't really want to do it. After school that day, she came to our volleyball practice. She ended up loving the sport, and she also plays it to this day. There are many different activities, such as theater, art, sports, science and math clubs, and the student council. Students are most likely going to find an activity they like and stick with it as they get older. Doing an activity that you enjoy can be very entertaining, and you might keep doing it in the future. I am in my school's eighth grade chorus, and I want to continue this activity as I get into high school. If you really enjoy these activities at school, you might also try to practice them at home. If you like to go to an art club at your school, you might continue to draw at home. These activities can also lead to trying to improve in your hobby as well. I continue to draw at home so I can improve. Schools give access to these potential new hobbies and activities, and I think that students should go to them and give them a chance. 
3058	Technology has been used for decades in education, from the basic computer to smart boards technology has been commonly used to improve the learning capabilities of students in modern times. The 'Facial Action Coding System'  technology has the ability to help professors and teachers around the world get more into the minds of their students and engage the students into a classroom where learning is not a unified thing, but more customized and free depending on student ability. 
3059	Along with that teachers and professors around the world have had to adapt to the higher usage of technology and programs to teach their students. This program gives teachers and technology the ability to adapt to their students, and encourage even confused or fearful students to learn by engaging a learning environment where a student's computer or device could read and recognize the confusion or joy a student is undergoing while learning,and therefor helping the teacher know the students level of understanding. 
3060	Secondly, having a program installed into the lense of cameras in students devices would open up new insight to teachers 
3061	For example, if a student watches a video lesson in a History class and is confused by something then their teacher could find the question, or peice of video, and simply adjust the lesson to fit the demographic and understanding of that child. There are many benifits to this technology including in the home, if a parent were to have the ability to see where their child was confused or frusterated the parent could also take some time to cover the missing material. This also prevents students who are fustrated but are to fearful or anxious to ask for help to not recive the assistance they need. This technology could open up door ways for students instead of them being lost in the information, but this technology is still new. . 
3062	In conclusion, the 'Facial Action Coding System' opens new advancments in the the education systems by encourgaing an environment where teachers could have the technology to know when a student was confused or not understanding information, and also giving the ability for teachers to construct a lesson to fit the children who don't directly understand. It also proves a good method for parents to get involved in their child's learning and help the student with direct problems at the root instead of complications with the entire subject 
3063	So yes, this technology is very vaulable to the education of millions of students around the world who don't fully grasp their teachers learning methods or are just confused. 
3064	"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" thinks that exploring Venus is worth the risks that are required. "
3065	This evidence shows how the landscape of Venus has the possibility to be a home for humans. The similarities between Earth and Venus make Venus a valuable place to explore in greater depth. 
3066	Although Venus has a similar terrain to Earth, the ground climate is too rough for anyone to safely land in Venus. 
3067	"Venus has a temperature that humans can not survive in, 800 degrees Fahrenheit. Also on Venus the pressure is 90 times what humans experience on Earth. Humans have never experienced conditions as extreme as those on Venus: ""Even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of [the] oceans"" would be crushed and the high temperatures ""would liquefy many metals."" Something that was made to be able to go withstand high pressures, like a submarine, would be crushed on Venus, and metals can withstand very high temperatures but on venus they would liqeufy. It is unsafe and humanly impossible for humans to try to explore the land of Venus when some of the best technology can not even withstand the climate of Venus. "
3068	As of now there is not enough technology for humans to explore Venus on the surface, but they can explore Venus from above. It is a possibility for scientists to hover 30 miles above Venus 
3069	"This way the scientists will not have to experience the total wrath of Venus's surface, but they would experince ""temperatures that would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, [and] the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth."" Humans can live in those conditions, even though they may not be ideal. Scientists would be able to explore Venus without putting them at risk. There is still not technology for the scientists to throughly explore Venus the way they want to. They would only get a glimpse into what Venus is like. New inivations are being worked on that can withstand Venus's tumultous surface, so that scientists can get the full picture of  Venus. "
3070	Venus has great potential for exploration, but with that great potential comes great risk. The author of the article talks about the problems with exploring Venus, but he also talks about how exploring Venus is something that is a possibilty for the future. Venus is very similar to Earth in the terrain that they both have, but the surface conditions of Venus are deadly to humans. There is the possibilty of hovering above Venus to be closer to the surface without having to experince the extreme conditions. With the advancements in technology and new innovations scientists are hoping that there is a way for them to get closer to the surface without endangering their lives. 
3071	Lots of kids love having summer break off from school, but when it comes to summer assignments there's only so much time in the summer for students to fit all their prior plans in with all the over-the-summer school work their teachers assign. And majority of students would also rather not do school work on their break from school and would just want to enjoy the time off but many schools require students to do some sort of school work over the summer to keep their brains active and to help them continue to learn. Some students have take part in saying that they would like to design their own summer projects for many different reason. In contrast, some teachers don't agree with the students for the summer projects to be student-designed. 
3072	The required summer assignments should be teacher-designed by the students upcoming teacher 
3073	the students can be prepared fully on what they are going to learn for the upcoming school year, 
3074	so that the their teachers can make sure they include work from last year so they don't forget about the stuff they previously learned about, 
3075	because teachers will most likely organize the work to be an appropriate amount since they're use to giving school work with projects and due dates but also understand that there are students that go on vacations and won't have the whole summer to complete an assignment. 
3076	Teachers will know exactly how to format these projects and/or school work in correct ways to make their students stay active in learning and thinking to be prepared for the upcoming school year since they obviously will be teaching it for the rest of the school year 
3077	Teachers can also make sure to include in their summer project some previously learned information on their summer assignments to not only see if they remember and fully learned that particular concept, but to also see where as a student they stand and if they need more help or attention with that topic 
3078	Since teachers became teachers by going to graduate school and some having other degrees included for their job, they usually have a good, if not, great understanding of good teaching skills and tactics and work format styles from their own past professors and previous teaching experiences. If they have a lot experience, it could help them gain knowledge over the time being on what worked well for them as a teacher and their students versus what didn't work. The teachers could have also been exposed to many different teaching styles and found one they believe is easiest to understand and/or thinks is easiest or their level of students to understand 
3079	Teachers can know ways to make sure projects or assignments could be organized good while also not entirely taking up a whole students summer with school work. 
3080	They can organize it so it's spread out or split up into parts at a time so they don't put much pressure on the student who could feel overwhelmed by all the work they have to complete in a short amount of time. Especially if the student waits until the last minute to complete their summer assignment because they thought the assignment was really long and time consuming.  
3081	teacher-designed projects would be more efficient regardless since it could be more helpful to teacher because it could be based on exactly what the teacher wants to know about what the student knows to help them succeed for the rest of the school year. And most summer assignments are different depending on the class too. If a student is going into a class they've never taken before, how could they make up a student-designed summer assignment to help them when their teacher could just give them a direct summer assignment as a jump start for the school year. 
3082	they can show they've learned over time and make it into a project where they show what they've learned. 
3083	Extracurricular activities can be the thing that a student looks forward to doing that day, counting down the hours and minutes until school ends. They are a great place to interact with others and develop an interest or skill, where lasting friendships can be made outside of a student's normal social circles. The students have a greater control over how things are run, providing kids the chance to step into leadership roles. However, they are not for everyone. 
3084	the school could not cover the wide range of interests students have, 
3085	would waste time that students need, 
3086	would ruin the experiences of other people participating in the activity. 
3087	The point of extracurricular activities, after all, is to develop skills farther than what students learn in school. While some people with interests like football and journalism can join school-sponsored extracurricular activities like the football team or the school newspaper, other students enjoy more niche or specific subjects. Incorporating these subjects into school extracurricular clubs would be difficult due to high equipment costs, lack of space, lack of widespread interest, or several other reasons. For example, some students consider fencing to be their favorite activity. However, the equipment required to do fencing is expensive and prone to breaking. This may not be extremely hard for one person to afford, but starting a school fencing club would require the school to buy several sets. Furthermore, fencing also requires a 14 meter strip as well as extra room so other students will not get hit by any stray blades. The school's resources are limited, and could not sponsor an activity like this without the kind of support that only mainstream sports have. In the meantime, it is not fair to the students who fence to force them into another activity when they could be practicing fencing outside of school. 
3088	School already takes up a large chunk of the day, but by requiring students to do extracurricular activities, kids are forced to stay for one or two more hours doing activities that do not seem worth spending time on. If a student chooses to join an extracurricular because they wanted to and not because it was required, the activity wouldn't seem like a waste of time. For the other students, however, those few hours could be spent on homework, catching up on sleep, connecting with friends and family, or pursuing their interests outside of school. Many students are on sports travel teams, and they need the time to practice with their team. Some people take classes outside of school or just prefer to do activities they like at home. Although these students are not joining school clubs, they are still doing extracurricular activities and should be able to continue doing so without worrying about running out of time for homework or missing out on sleep. 
3089	Making extracurricular activities a requirement would cause people to join clubs without genuine interest in the activity. These students will show less enthusiasm and put in less effort towards club activities and can drag things down for other students. They could be unwilling to do work or serve as a distraction to other students. There is a similar situation in elective courses, where some students only select a course because they believe it will be an easy class. Those students tend to participate less or be loud and off-topic. During group projects, they don't contribute as much. For many other students, it is frustrating to deal with these people, especially since there is no common interest in the activity they are doing.  
3090	Requiring participation in extracurricular activities ultimately does more harm than good to students because it disregards that broad range of activities students enjoy and takes valuable time from students who should be free to choose how to spend it. It also detracts from the value of extracurricular activities- which are created by people cooperating and acting on a common interest -by adding people who don't enjoy the activity. Inspiring students to be curious and passionate should be the school's priority, but by requiring students to do an extracurricular club the schools are only boxing students into a mold that ignores the complexity and individuality of each person. Students are required to get an education that will help them survive as adults, but they should be able to decide which hobbies and skills they want to specialize in. In the end, the unique path they decide to carve out for themselves should be of their own making. 
3091	Well, first of all, The atmospere of Venus has a THICK layer of carbon dioxide the covers 98% of the planet, in which makes Everything a much hoter place,but, to top it of with the atmosphere problem, the clouds in there have highly corrosive sulfuric acid. If we some how passes through the atmosphere, than we'll face ANOTHER problem with the ground. Since Venus is the second planet from our sun and with all those carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the surface ground temperature is over 800 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT. In which with the surface and the atmosphere, it could basically melt many types of metal with no problem. Another Problem is that the atmosphereic preassure is 90x greater than our Earth, with that much preassure could easily crushed a submarine that is built to surrvive the deeper end of the ocean. From what we gather small information from our space craft, the geology of venus pretty much have erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes. 
3092	Some schools have debated if they should make every single student participate in extracurricular activities. I believe that they should not make kids do extracurricular activities they don't want to do. It would be extra work for the school and it would be bad for the students. If the principal decided to change the school's system so that each and every student would have to do an extracurricular activity it would end up negatively for most students. The main reasons it would be bad are 
3093	many children will not have the time to do work they shouldn't have to do, 
3094	kids are already stressed enough with their school work and other things, 
3095	many kids who are being forced into doing this probably wouldn't enjoy these activities. 
3096	I believe that we should just keep our school's system the same and the school should not make someone do an unnecessary activity that they didn't want to take part in in the first place. 
3097	While some may say that kids have too much free time and we should give them something to do so they aren't on electronics, 
3098	I strongly disagree with that statement. I am a student, and a majority of my peers take part in many other activities, such as sports, musical instruments, plays, and any other things along those lines, that wouldn't allow them to have any spare time to do another activity. 
3099	In fact, according to a study performed by Harvard University, almost 85 percent of students participate in after school activities that take up more than 8 hours of time per week. This would include practicing the activity and for many activities you would have to compete. For example, one of my friends, Generic_Name, does many activities. She plays on a competitive lacrosse team, she plays a musical instrument, and she takes all honor classes. She barely finishes all of her homework, and she has stupendous time management skills. If she had to take part in another after school activity, she wouldn't have time to do it all. Because kids do other things, if you made them partake in a new activity they would also become a lot more stressed. 
3100	If you make them participate in another activity, that will make their stress levels go up and could possibly push them over the edge. It's obvious that students won't have the best time management skills because they are kids. Since they don't have these skills, they will end up being stressed about completing their work. In a survey I compiled with seventh and eighth graders at my middle school, I discovered that a whopping 94 percent of students considered themselves stressed. 76 percent even went as far to say that they are overly stressed. This puts into perspective how students are already very stressed without the excess activities. Personally, I partake in a travel volleyball team, a musical instrument, all honor classes, I make sure that I study enough and do all of my homework, and I make time to spend maximum amounts of time with my family and friends as possible. I manage to finish all of this, but many days I do not get much sleep. On most week days I get about 6 hours and the recommended amount of sleep for a thirteen year old is about 8. It can get very tough to finish all of my tasks I have to complete in one day. I know that if my school made me participate in another extracurricular activity I would not be able to complete all of this work I previously had to finish. And obviously school would be my top priority to complete, so I would possibly have to drop some of my hobbies and interests that I love. Another reason we shouldn't enforce this rule is that many kids that the school is forcing to do the activity probably won't enjoy it. 
3101	The main extracurricular activities that people partake at my school are plays and clubs where you can compete in, such as Model United Nations, debate club, Science Olympiad, and many others. At my school with over 1,000 students, only about 100 decide to join these clubs. These clubs only appeal to certain people that enjoy academics. If you're interested in things related to sports, my school does not have much to offer for you. When my sister was in middle school, about 7 years ago, they had very few clubs. They had 3 official clubs. Our mom made her choose a club to participate in. All that she could choose from was debate club, chess club, and homework club.  She had little to no interest in doing any of these clubs that she thought were boring and dumb. She ended up doing chess club, but she ended up hating it immensely. She said that everyone was better than her and she didn't even know how to play. This all happened because she was forced to pick an activity from three, horrible sounding, activities. This all would not have happened if no one had made her do an activity she despised. The same thing will end up happening to many children if the schools make them participate in activities they don't wish to do. Kids doing something that they don't want to do will end up with them being unhappy, which will end up in a negative learning environment. 
3102	students may take a while to come up with a project or idea, 
3103	teacher- designed projects are already made and ready to go, 
3104	Projects would be less confusing when made by the teacher themselves. 
3105	Students are in school at least 8 to 9 months or for some students all year around, so when it comes to summer break students are ready to relax, go on vacation, or just sleep. Students already have done tons of projects for classes or even just for one class and those projects are very stressful for some. Summer in a lot of cases are relax time and forget about school time so when they are given a project to do a lot would just put it to the side and dont do it at all. When coming up with ideas on what to do some will not know or just not even try that's why it think it should be teacher-base. 
3106	If students are given the instructions and already know the idea it makes it a little easier to get done over the summer. Students tend to procrastinate and take their time, which they should, but that time may be at the last minute. It could be August and they have to go back to school that following week and haven't even came up with an idea yet. Teacher-based projects already have the idea and the instructions on how to do it and it saves time depending on the project. Students can still not do it at all but at least they have the foundation on what to do and start it and have it done with in weeks or days. 
3107	Students already dont want to do the project in the first place so the idea may be very confusing to other students or the teacher. If the project is a group project the idea may not be understood fully and may get taking the wrong way. Students school brains are already shut down so when to making ideas students tend to wing it and just throw it out especially when it is a group project. They think that the other is just going to figure it out on their own and that may not be the case or they leave each other hanging. Teacher- based projects make it easier because the idea and instructions are already there and all the students have to do is just follow them. 
3108	Teacher-based projects do have a downside to them. 
3109	Teachers, of course, have been teaching and assigning projects all year and some are easy and some are not. Projects that are given by the teacher have to be completed by the instructions given and if it is not completed that way or in that way all that hard work just went down the drain. Student- based project do make it easier because it is their idea, their instructions, and their own way. So all that hard work doesn't have to go the drain for nothing. Student-based projects can be more creative because it is made from scratch and from their own head. Teacher-based projects are usually less creative because students are just trying to finish it and get it over with. In contrast, students may take a lot of time or wait till the last minute. 
3110	Schools that require students to complete summer projects should make the projects student designed, proving that there are many different ways of learning.  
3111	Depending on the student, some methods of learning are incredibly more beneficial than others. 
3112	When I learned vital concepts such as multiplication, the way my teacher taught was through constant out loud repetition of the material, which helped my classmates along, but not me. I needed to see the problem worked out and look at the numbers because I had trouble picturing all the math and numbers in my head. Not being able to understand that basic concept of multiplication was detrimental to my math abilities and led the following years of my math career to be absolutely exhausting. This same scenario could take place involving summer projects. A teacher could give a student a summer assignment to help them learn about a concept in that class, but if the design of the assignment was difficult for the student to understand, it could be more hurtful than helpful. The entire reason teachers and schools assign projects over the summer is to assure that students will continue to learn during their break, but how are the students supposed to learn if they can't understand or have trouble with the assignment? 
3113	Projects are meant to provoke students to think, and having students design the project themselves is a great way for them to think more and therefore learn more. 
3114	If students designed a summer project, they would have to think about what to do since they most likely won't have as many guidelines that a teacher typically would give. This allows students the opportunity to be creative and think outside the box. Students could then potentially learn a lot about themselves and not just whatever the subject of the project is. 
3115	If the student creates the project themselves, it seems more likely that they would actually enjoy the project. And if they enjoyed doing the project, they will remember it more. 
3116	I don't remember the material from my psychology summer assignment this year. All we had to do was research and write about a basic concept from psychology. I do, however, remember the Latin project I did in seventh grade. I think this is because I was allowed to do the project on anything related to Latin that I wanted. All my teacher asked of us was that the project was somehow Latin related. I decided to do my project on ancient roman customs, specifically the different rituals performed as a person reaches certain ages. From that project I remember things like that at six months old a young roman boy gets a round pendant called a bulla to protect them from evil spirits and when they reach age twelve the receive a new type of toga and more. I could not tell you about the five methods of observation used in psychology, which is what my summer assignment this year (11th grade) was about. 
3117	Some may argue that having students design summer projects is a bad idea because the typical student is lazy and will make an easy project design so that they won't have to actually learn anything. 
3118	If this is true, having a teacher designed project does not change that situation. The reality is that if a student is lazy and doesn't want to learn, they will not learn. 
3119	For my psychology summer assignment, I was lazy during the summer and did not want to do it, but eventually I did it the day before they school year started and learned nothing because it was boring and I wanted to get it over with. However, if the assignment was to research anything I wanted about psychology, perhaps it could have turned out like my 7th grade Latin assignment and I would've actually learned something. From personal experience I can say that the best way to combat an apathetic student is to gain their interest somehow, which could be done by allowing them the freedom to design their own project. For example, I loved reading  Frankenstein in English, but after having to write so much about it I no longer like it and don't really remember much of what happened.  Even if a subject is interesting, the desire to do a project on it can be crushed by the formatting of the project. Allowing students to do whatever format they want could make students gain interest and want to learn more about a subject compared to doing something they don't want, like writing an essay, which may make them harbor resentment toward the subject instead. 
3120	the purpose of the teacher is to guide their students on a path of enlightenment through the education system, 
3121	students are inherently lazy and will make an easy project, 
3122	it provides the teacher a bar for which a teacher can know how advanced their students are before they come to class on the first day. 
3123	An educational study at Yale shows that students who go to cram school over the summer have a tendency to achieve a higher score on the SAT compared to those of a self taught student at home. This is without a doubt, proof that a curriculum and or project assigned from a teacher is best to give a student to insure that they retain previous knowledge and can build off of it. With the teacher giving a direct projection and project on what a student needs to know also helps the student, because the student doesn't have to aimlessly ponder on what the teacher wants them to know next year. It allows students to have a narrow and direct line of sight to their goal , and enables to teacher to have a direct overview on the project. 
3124	If a summer project was Student-designed the project, would be of the most basic and rudimentary work a students would want to finish it as fast as possible. As seen in the daily lives of Generic_School students, in which 65% take non honors or AP level courses. We can see a trend that students are not willing to challenge themselves and would not be capable to create a project, in which the project would be academically sufficient for their studies next year. Furthermore it can be shown on a global level in which the United States is ranked within the top 15 but not top 5 based on educational levels. If we as an American culture can't rise up to be a leading power in education with the help of our teachers, how can we expect student-designed projects and studies to do any better. 
3125	The Generic_School system as had tremendous amount of trouble in which teachers have to ask for multiple planning days. The reasoning for this is due to the fact that students don't knowing the fundamental requirements for a class when they walk into the classroom on the first day. This causes teachers to have to readjust their curriculum in order for the students to catch up to where the teacher wants them to be. A teacher-designed project would allow the teacher to tell the students the basic information they need to know before they come into the class, it also allows to students to prepare their mentality going into the school year. 
3126	The development of human society as a whole is told by its children and those who can help cultivate the young. Teacher-designed project would provide students a strong foundation for the year to come, it stops students from being lazy and wasting their talents, and helps teachers formulate a more precise teaching curriculum for their students. These examples alone show that summer projects  NEED  to be teacher-designed to insure the betterment of the young generation. 
3127	"Contrary to popular belief, there is nothing unatural about the supposed ""Face on Mars"". Though many would like to believe in the supernatural, this oddity is nothing but a rock formation. There are several reasons as to why the theory of aliens making this formation is preposterous, each reason stronger than the previous. "
3128	First and foremost, if these photos of the alleged face were the work of possible Martians, NASA would have found further evidence by now. 
3129	Even if the cameras used to take these pictures weren't of the highest quality, said cameras would have been able to at least catch some photos of further signs of life. Things such as houses or buildings, for example. Now, if some one would like to argue that the aliens lived in caves or other natural formations of the sort, how would those people like to argue the fact that there are no visible creatures in any photos? Do they expect people to believe that every living thing on Mars decided to hide from a satelite they would not even be able to see from the surface? 
3130	Additionally, even if NASA had found this further evidence, why would the company try to hide it? 
3131	Not only would releasing such infrormation to the public leave NASA with all sorts of world renouned achievements, it would be more than beneficial for the company's financial standpoint. Releasing statements as big as signs of life on Mars would do wonders for the company. The more achievements, the more sponsors will see the potential in investing money in a program such as NASA. Adding to that, the more sponsors, the more projects NASA can fund, and by extension, the more the foundation will be able to learn and teach the public. 
3132	Probably the most obvious piece of evidence that busts the idea of unknown life, is that these photos were taken in 1976 (according to paragraph 5 of Unmasking the Face on Mars) . Technology at that time was still fairly primitive, especially for space travel. 
3133	"Things like the picture of the Loch Ness Moster, the famous photo that was confirmed to be faked. Another good example is the ""Bigfoot"" craze. Both cases are similar to this one because all are just photos that are hard to be certain about, that sparked international interest. Not only are they similar that way, but each one has been debunked with solid evidence. "
3134	They polute the air and they can be very dangerous. 
3135	"Although cars make everyday life easier, lessening the use of them could potentially ""save the world."" "
3136	"Polution is at an all time high and car emissions are largely to blame. In paragraph five it states that, ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Euope... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States."" This is saying that the emissions from cars are destroying the earth. Though going to the grocery store that is two miles away may seem easier by just hoping in the car and arriving in less than five minutes, walking or biking would be better for you and the environment. Many cities are even focusing on becoming more ""pedestrian friendly"" to help boost the enthusiasm of cutting the use of cars. Walking is not the only option either, using hybrid cars, carpooling, or public transportation is also an option. Though still involving the use of cars, emissions would be reduced greatly. Also, emissions can cause sickness. In large cities where cars are depended on there is Smog. Smog is a thick black cloud of pollution that hangs in the air over large ciies. Smog can make you very sick if you injest it. Many people in cities that do have smog have to wear face masks when walking outside. I do not think that face masks are a new trend that everyone would like to start wearing. Lessening the use of cars around us would be a healthy step towards restoring our environment and could start a trend for others to do so aswell. "
3137	Another advantage of cutting the use of cars would be less accidents 
3138	Thousands of car related accidents happen every minute around the world in automobiles. If everyone started walking, biking, or using pubilc transportation less cars would be on the road leading to less accidents. Families lose loved ones everyday just because the driver of the car isnt paying attention 
3139	Drivers have many extra responisbilities when opperating the vehicle. They have to watch everything around them, including being responsible for everyone else in the car. 
3140	"Many people have reported being ""less stressed"" after they lowered the use of cars. "
3141	"Heidrun Walter said ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" when talking about moving to a car free community. Thousands are converting to the trend of using the car less and others are cutting the use completely! Following this trend would be a large benefit to yourself and the enviornment around you. "
3142	Lastly, America is known for being obese and cars support this idea. Cars make it easy for someone to get places without putting any physical work into it. Cars encourage people to be lazy 
3143	Lowering the use of cars and walking more would help reduce the percent of people that are overweight in our country 
3144	Instead of wanting to get in the car and drive to do something they could walk and get some excercise or even take a bike if they wanted to get there faster. Walking and biking are low intensity excercises making it easy for everyone to participate. Many overweight people always feel lathargic, getting out and walking or biking would also help them to feel better. Doing this would help our people and environtment become more heatlhy. 
3145	Cars are a great invention but it is not necessary for every individual to have one. Walking and biking are better alternatives. The use of cars has gone through the roof creating problems around the world. A healthy environment for our children and grandchildren is what we imagine. One does not think of using a car as damaging to the enviornment until after they have done it. Limiting car usage would turn the world into a healthier, stress reduced place. For these reasons I think it would be of best interest to try and find other alternatives to driving as much.            
3146	Education is critical at any age, but especially to those who remain still in grade school. Taking time off such as summer break, poses issues for teaches to make sure their students are still growing their knowledge on this time off. Many school have begun to introduce summer assignments to their students as an attempt to decrease this time that is spent not completely focused on school. 
3147	Although many believe that these projects should be driven by the teacher, students should be the one to design these projects 
3148	it sparks creativity 
3149	motivation 
3150	a greater understanding of the topic. 
3151	By giving students the opportunity to design their own projects, they get the chance to display their creativity. 
3152	This topic of creativity is important because it is what separates peers from each other so that not one person is the same. Each student has their own style that is different from those around which is what makes them unique. When student driven projects are created, it forces those who complete the project to think outside of the box. This is significant because it is what grows the knowledge of each student; by doing this they are learning the new material as the project is being completed. By implementing these sort of projects the students creativity is apparent because teachers are not giving the student the task; rather the student is the one designing and completing the assignment all on their own. Creativity is an essential piece to the puzzle of learning for children and by creating student-designed projects, each child will benefit across the board. 
3153	When projects are given by teachers, especially over the summer, students are not motivated to complete the task. 
3154	Over summer break, many students just want to be able to relax and not do work that they may have little interest in that has been assigned by their teacher. By having student-driven projects, it gives students an opportunity to create something that they are passionate about. This is important because when a student is passionate about what they are working on, it creates motivation for them to complete the assignment. A student is highly likely to complete an assignment that they are involved in because it is relative to their life. Many projects that are handed around by teachers have little to no relevance to the lives of students. If students get the opportunity to create their own assignment, they will feel a sense of pride because they are passionate about the topic. This leads to greater motivation internally for any student which leads to better overall results. 
3155	Material that has been researched by the student and completed on their own has been proven to show greater results in the grade attached to the project. When an assignment has been handed to a student to complete that has been created by someone else, they are likely only to do the minimum of what has been assigned. By doing this they are not able to gain full knowledge of the topic and fully understand what is going on 
3156	On the flip side, when a student has to design a project on their own and research the material, they gain a greater understanding of the task at hand. 
3157	By having little to no teacher involvement, it forces students to have to learn the material all on their own which has been proven that the student retains the information longer. This does not just help students for this topic, but helps them in life as well because if they are able to learn on their own they will be able to hold all of this information instead of just retaining it for one assignment and then being done with it after. In the end, student-driven projects causes students to better understand the material for not only one project. 
3158	By creating student driven projects, many students get the opportunity to show off what they can do without being confined into the same box as their peers. For them, it is a way to stand out among those students around them. When the student can create something that they are passionate about, they will want to complete it to the best of their ability. But, since they are learning this material on their own, they are more likely to have a strong foundation on the topic which is only something that is beneficial to them in the end. By schools implementing student-designed summer projects, their students will be better off in the end.  
3159	People are coming to the conclusion that if we, as a whole, decide to start cutting down on our usage of cars it can benefit the way we live.  
3160	The idea of using cars, for some, it causes them stress 
3161	they're always tense, not using a car makes them happier, as stated by Heidrun Walter, a media trainer and mother of two (Source 1). The stress aspect of this could be due to the fact that in the most recent years, the percentage of car crashes and accidents have gone up. Many people abhor the idea of using cars because they have been in an terible accident themselves or someone close to them. Also, it can even just be all the traffic jams that occur during rush hour, which makes people late and accidents do happen. For example in Bogota, Colombia, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to their designated location, to leave the streets due to traffic jams (Source 3). Since they knew that lots of their citizens were deciding not to use cars they started making uneven, pitted sidewalks into nice, smooth, replaced ones for them (Source 3). 
3162	Another reason why people want to limit their usage on cars is because of all the pollution cars create. 
3163	Passenger cars are rsponsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States (Source 1). Not many people think about the effects of air pollution like smog, but it is a big deal. Since people don't think about it often, there is no way for the majority of us to try and find a solution to put into action to stop it or help it go down. In Paris, there was a partial driving ban to clear the air around the city (Source 2). Paris' partial ban was their idea to try and make their city a better place. With the ban being enforced and put into play there  were about 4,000 drivers fined (Source 2). It turns out that since the driving ban was made the congestion, car traffic, had gone down 60 percent in the capital of France, just after five days of less smog pollution and Paris is typically known to have more smog than any other European capitals (Source 2). This goes to show, that slowly people are actually becoming aware of what's going on and they actually care enought to try and make things better. 
3164	All in all, there are many ways to try and cut down on our car usage for the better. It can be anything from not buying as many cars, to deciding to not use cars at all and deciding to walk, skate, and bike, etc. Not only will limiting our car usage as a whole stop traffic jams, car accidents, air pollution, and more, it will help to benefit our lives for the better whether or not people want to believe it. If things keep going from here, and more and more decide that less car usage is better than over a time span of let's say 20-30 years, there could be a lot less dangerous things occuring in our lives.    
3165	Many people throughout the world, would agree that car usage plays a significant role in daily lives. Although some may argue it plays an important role or a not so important role, the limitation of car usuage would be a very helpful thing for everyone, and the world we are surrounded by. 
3166	Advantages such as, less pollution in the enviroment by creating less smog, 
3167	making the cities and roads a lot safer, by lowering the risk of getting into or even causing a wreck, 
3168	even something as simple as making your life, and the lives around you much more peaceful. 
3169	If car usuage was limited in cities there would be less smog, and pollution in the air. Not only would it be better for the enviroment, it would also be better for your health.  
3170	"Wrecks are things that claim the lives of people each and everyday. Some can be prevented, yet not all can. Think of how many lives are taken each day, due to wrecks because of things like congestion in big cities. Or even things such as someone behind the wheel who is stressed, and driving wrecklessly. A source from paragraph 3, states ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way"" Many people, get tense and stressed from the drivers around them. Limiting how much you use a car, can improve things such as stress levels. Imagine how much more at ease you would be if you constantly heard, a bicylest wizzing by you, or hearing children chattering and laughing among themselves, instead of hearing horns honking, loud motors, or even the sound of a car crash.  Roads and streets take up much more space than we think or even realize. With less cars on the road everyday and more people walking, or riding a bike, could only mean one thing; less roads and bigger sidewalks. More cities are trying to make limiting car usage a much bigger thing, ""...in attempts to make suburbs more compact..."" Source one, also states that ""In this new approach, stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather that in malls along some distant highway. (paragraph 6) "
3171	Getting to these places will become safer for everyone.  
3172	As you can see, there are many advantages to limiting car usage, such as, limiting the amount of pollution there is, lowering the risks of getting into, or even causing a wreck, and even something as simple as making it a more peaceful enviroment to live in, not only for yourself, but for others around you. Our world, and daily lives would be affected in great ways, in more cities, and even more countries, participated in lessing the amount of car usage.           
3173	Teachers have more often than not been the epicenter of academic negativity. There always has been and always will complain about teaching styles. If students could take the steering wheel, chances are they will understand the material taught and retain that information. 
3174	summer projects should be student designed rather than teacher designed 
3175	it allows for a more positve and creative atmosphere, 
3176	improved scheduling 
3177	higher pass rates.  
3178	However, if the projects were both educational and entertaining, then summer would be that much more enjoyable. It would also allow the content to soak in much better. 
3179	With that being said, student designed projects are the much better route. With students being able to choose the subject and presentation style of the project, it will allow for creative juices to flow through everyones' minds and really intrigue the students. It would also allow for better time management on the development of said project. Finally, if students are interested in their projects and they genuinely want to do it, then the grades will improve. They will also be able to gather and retain the information that is being introduced to them. 
3180	students completing the project would rather make it themselves than have a teacher assign the project to them. 
3181	they will make it more fun and interesting for themselves, 
3182	they will make the project easier for them to understand, 
3183	they will enjoy doing the project since it will be from their prospective. 
3184	Although a student-based project would be more enjoyable for them to complete, a teacher based project would be more effective for both the teacher and the student. The teacher would make the project how it's supposed to be because they know what the students are supposed to learn over the summer. Having the students make their own project would make it to easy for them and the teacher would not really know what is going on because the kids are not going to school. Teachers would want the students to know the proper materials for the next school year even if it mean't just writing a summary of a book. 
3185	The summer project should be a teacher-based project because it informs the teacher of what is happening and what they are doing during the project, it helps the student learn what they need to maintain in their brain during the summer, and it also makes sure the project is not to easy or hard for the students. 
3186	The student would not want to spend their summer doing a boring project because that would mean that they would put it off until the end of summer or they might just not do it at all. Having a project that makes them go outside and explore the world is very interesting and would make anyone want to do it. Students need motivation and having the project be something fun like go to an amusement park and explain what your see. If a teacher really wants a student to spend their summer doing a project, there has to be a motivation factor or something that makes them want to complete the project. 
3187	Student could work in groups to make it easier. It would not necessarily be the whole project being easier it would just be making short cuts to get to one point faster. The groups would be people who are already friends and that would motivate them to do the project because then while doing work they still hang out with their friends. Making the project easier might also mean that the students might be able to understand it better and if they do need help the can ask their peers or email the teacher. 
3188	when you limit car usage, it is better for the environment because off all the greenhouse gas reduction caused by not using as many cars and other gas producing vehicles as much 
3189	The summer months are a key time for both students and teachers to regroup from the school year that just occurred, and to prepare for the school year that is to come at the end of their short break. This time is important to both groups because it is a more care free period where they are not under the constant pressure school brings. This time can be very beneficial for everyone to prepare for the next school year. Studies have shown that students who do not continue to do educational work over the summer months fall behind and lose the information they gained during the prior school year. 
3190	The most ideal project is teacher-designed because a student will most likely not plan an assignment that is actually helpful or one that prepares them for the upcoming year. 
3191	A teacher will be able to design one that prepares the students well for the upcoming curriculum 
3192	helps them manage their time well over the summer months 
3193	A summer assignment is one that will not be necessarily a very difficult one but it will require time management and if done well, can be very beneficial for the students. 
3194	Honestly I do not trust myself enough to create a well thought out project for myself without cutting myself some slack. I would much rather have a teacher give me the assignment and complete it to the best of my abilities. 
3195	In conclusion, I believe that all the assignments that I am given during the summer months are well done and should be designed by the teachers instead of the students doing it for themselves. In the past the summer assignments that I have been given have not been too difficult and I never really minded doing them. The teacher is the one who teaches the class and if they expect us to have prior knowledge of the class then they should be the ones designing it. It is not going to be harmful and there is plenty of time over the summer for it to be completed so I do believe that a project designed by teacher over the summer is more beneficial then one that would be designed by a student.  
3196	Phone use and driving are two activities that should never be intertwined. Using a phone while driving is not acceptable. The level of distraction that comes from using a phone takes a driver's attention away from the road. A driver's attention should be focused on the roadway, not a phone screen. Cell phone use while operating a motor vehicle has led to a heartbreaking amount of people losing their lives and even more injuries. It is simply not safe and can lead to dangerous and heart wrenching moments. 
3197	Cell phone use while driving needs to be banned nationwide. It will not cease to occur unless people see and hear the damage it can inflict. 
3198	When someone is using their phone while operating a motor vehicle, it takes a significant amount of attention away from the road, and onto the phone instead. 
3199	Looking down at a cell phone for 5 sec while going just 55 mph means that you have just crossed the length of an entire football field without looking up at the road. The AAA Foundation For Traffic Safety ranked using a hands-free mobile device as a level 2 distraction and texting while operating a vehicle as a level 3 distraction, the highest level. Such distractions are unacceptable when operating a motor vehicle, it could lead to injuries or worse. A study conducted by Cambridge Mobile Telematics revealed that roughly 52% of drives that resulted in a crash were caused by distracted driving, and roughly eleven teens die per day as a result of texting and driving. Inexperienced drivers, such as teens, are more prone to engage in distracted driving, and are more likely to suffer a crash or accident when engaging in distracted driving. Having your attention focused on anything other than the road is a terrible and dangerous idea, and should not be tolerated under any circumstance. 
3200	Using a phone while driving, be it calling, texting, or anything else, can lead to horrible and heartbreaking injuries and even deaths. 
3201	In 2016 alone, distracted driving took the lives of 3,450 drivers, and injured over 300,000 more. Using a phone while driving is a gamble with death. The CDC reports that nine people are killed and more than 1,000 people are injured daily as a result of distracted driving. Despite knowing these facts, many drivers still report that they engage in distracted driving, usually via phone. The individuals who choose not to use their phone while driving realize the consequences of distracted driving, and choose to seek the benefits of not using a phone while driving. Cell phone use while driving is a horrible practice. Sending a text is most certainly not worth a human life.  
3202	Using a phone while driving, or being distracted by any piece of technology for that matter, is not acceptable. Lives have been lost, many have been injured, and vehicles have been totaled, all because of a call or text message. Laws must be put in place, and knowledge must be spread to end this practice. When driving, please put your phone down, and instead focus your attention to the task at hand.   
3203	97 percent of carbon dioxide blankets venus and clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venus atmosphere and a temperature of 800 degrees fahrenheit and atmospheric pressure that is 90 times greater than what we expirence on earth those conditions are way to extreme that humans don't encounter that on earth  
3204	Many scientist are looking for a way to get samples of rocks,gas,or anthing else that they can use to find out more about venus but they cannot do that 
3205	"Its 1983, the stickiness of your fingers still reminisce the apricot you ate earlier while the beating sun destroys the meaning for sunglasses. The thought of eighty-seven more days stuck in your families summer house somewhere in Northern Italy with nothing but books, music, and your bike makes the thought of going back to school almost exciting. While you lay on your chair that afternoon, you remember that your previous History teacher assigned a project on ""The Roaring Twenties"". To be true, homework did not seem the most appealing activity to accomplish during that hot summer day, never the less, you were meaning to get up and wash your filthy hands of apricot juice. The project consisted of a writing assignment and a piece of self-made artwork. While the assignment felt like it would take all summer to accomplish, all of your previous knowledge kept flooding back like school was just yesterday. With no library within a three-mile radius, there was no need. Your project was finished within a week and the rest of your summer was dedicated to lounging beside the lake near your house and your grandfathers old books he left behind dating back to the early 1900's. "
3206	Summer projects designed by a students teacher is more effective in preserving a students learning from the previous year 
3207	students will have a set assignment directly related to previous school work, 
3208	an abundance of notes for additional help, 
3209	it readies students for their future occupations that will not have three-month breaks. 
3210	During school holidays, teachers are unable to assign work or projects to students because their breaks are dedicated to leaving ones mind at rest. Though students are unable to receive work over short-term breaks, work over the summer is optional for most teachers. While a break from constant learning is needed for the mind to repair itself, stopping all academic thought can effect the students recovery back into their new school term. Summer assignments most often consist of a short paper or vocabulary words needed for the upcoming year, all achievable within a couple weeks. Not only does being able to accomplish such little work in such a large amount of time show responsibility but it also prepares the student for larger sums of upcoming work. 
3211	Students learn up to four units a year and are assigned up to two projects per unit. Within the year, students attend around 240 classes per-year in taking around 1,920 hours of learning. Within all of the lessons and assignments, one is able to remember an abundant amount of information per-unit, allowing a student to combine all work into a project. Assume a project was based on biodiversity of animals within the agricultural system. With knowledge from ones own memory combined with notes and previous assignments, a project that consists of a 500-word summery of biodiversity will seem like a quick explanation. Though many children around the world suffer from short-term memory loss or just have difficulty harnessing previous knowledge, additional help from previous worksheets to study from or a phone call to a friend that has the same assignment might be able to significantly give a boost of memory or a kick-start. If all is lost from the previous year and making a phone call is not an option, libraries and the vast online knowledge of the web can help support uneasy topics and questions. 
3212	"Most occupations don't give out ""summer breaks"" for adults because a company can't run without their employees constantly focused on doing their work. While children are allowed a three-month break, during college, a student is no longer under the control of their guardians. Most college students don't get their parents to pay for their all of their supplies anymore. Reciving summer work is just a small step to the upcoming constant work of employees. To make sure students are ready to become an intern or employee, their teachers responsibilities are to make sure students are able to implement previous knowledge into future tasks. "
3213	When teachers assign work to students, its not for their own benefit. While most people think that teachers enjoy giving work, they're the ones spending countless hours correcting and grading their students assignments. By the end of ones long hot summer, all of the long nights and amazing memories are not only something special to ones heart, it can also be a kiss from an enemy. The amount of work that was constantly being inserted into a students mind disappears and with the new year approaching, the time it takes for each student to remember all of the hundreds of hours worth of information can be spent learning new topics. Summer assignments designed by teachers are most effective for each individual student because it implements previous information learned by students, allows students to find required tools to complete assigned work without a teacher, and finally prepares one for future occupations that work a students mind constantly throughout the summer.  
3214	Gangs are rising everywhere there technique is too bring in middle school students. As there developing physically and mentally, also middle school gets out early so there home before there parents. Some feel like there parents don't show the same love or don't care. So they turn to people who they think do. When people start making promises and make you feel good you want to be around them more. A gang is not the answer but most will turn to one. Gangs are telling young adults to do many things such as shoot up a rival gang, homicide. and drive bye. These can land you in prison for up to a life time. Teen are so easy to take advantage of.  Its not always gangs. Teen brains are still developing. The miss lead and boredness can lead to drugs use. Most teen are miss lead when its comes to drugs. A friend can say its cool or celebrity and then they all think it's cool. When teens are bored or left alone they turn to drugs. They feel as comfort and they get addicted. Drug usage can lead to overdose and even death. Its important the kids always have an trusted adult beside there parents to talk to.  As a victim of this I believe after school was a perfect fit for me. I got to surrounded myself by friends and teachers. It also helped me academically excel and I always had something to do 
3215	Over all kids should be forced to participate in extracurricular. It will set them on a straight path. They will excel academically and have better relationships with there there peers. It will keep then out of trouble in and out of school. It is important for kids to set on the right path at a young age so they can continue that in the future. After school is a blessing. It can save lives. What if your child was in that position?  
3216	In high school, summer projects (especially for advanced placement classes) are assignments that students must complete. There is no way to get out from completing those assignments. Teachers create most of these summer projects because they know exactly what the students should learn before they reach the first class of the year. For example, AP Language and Composition has the students create 15 precis on different nonfiction pieces and read the book  Thank You for Arguing in order to prepare for some of the essays that will be written for the exam. 
3217	it gives them a chance to show their creativity, 
3218	use their skills from prior knowledge, 
3219	build on life skills needed for the future.  
3220	Giving the students the ability to use their creativity is very important because it lets their voices and thoughts be heard. 
3221	Students usually have more time over the summer to be able to express their creativity, but that is being pulled back due to the same projects that teachers have them do every year. For example, most high school math classes provide students with a four to six page study guide to complete over the summer to make sure that their prior knowledge is still remembered. What if students created their own, unique study guides to complete? How about a presentation on the basics of a unit and sharing it with the class the first or second day back? Not only would the students be able to use their creativity in a project and express their knowledge in many different ways, students in the first class would have a great review of prior knowledge to prepare them for the challenge ahead. Giving students an assignment that they create also makes them more interested and determined to complete their project. Most students would rather show what they learned their own way than the same way as everyone else, and a lot of teacher-designed assignments have the students all doing the same thing. 
3222	It might be easier for the teacher to grade or review, 
3223	but students aren't enjoying the assignment because they aren't able to express their knowledge that is different from everyone else. Letting the students create their own projects will give them the opportunity to be creative and express their ideas. Additionally, students will continue to use or remember the skills and knowledge prior to help them create their projects. 
3224	The biggest reason why these summer projects are created is so that students wouldn't lose the skills and knowledge from previous years that are need for their upcoming classes. If the students created their own summer projects, they would not lose those skills or knowledge at all. 
3225	More than likely, they would research more about certain skills or information in order to make their projects even better and stand out from their peers. Subjects such as science and english are definitely able to make this happen because the skills and techniques that are learned can always be worked on, and they are easier for students to share what they know about certain topics. For example, AP chemistry has everyone doing the same assignment before the school year starts. Students in AP Chemistry, instead, could create their own experiments with the skills and knowledge acquired from Research Chemistry. The students would not only keep the techniques/skills practiced and knowledge from the year before, but also have the opportunity to explore different skills or use the skills obtained at a more advanced level. Even though students wouldn't lose the skills and knowledge learned from previous classes, they would also learn and build on some others skills such as life skills. 
3226	Student-designed projects would build on skills that students need for the future. 
3227	Teachers help them practice life skills with these projects as they could be long and tedious. However, students should have opportunities to build these skills themselves to prepare them for the upcoming school year and their future in general. Students who would work really hard on their own summer projects build their organizational skills as they plan out their assignments. Time management is another skill that is taken into these projects. Practicing time management prepares them for college and their future careers as deadlines can't be rearranged, and some tasks take more time than others. They would be able to schedule how much time in a day they can work on their summer assignments. Students who create their own projects also practice focusing and perseverance. There will be times where the project comes to a stand still in progress; practicing focus and perseverance encourages students to not give up on their projects and to make it the best it can be. In conclusion, students will prepare themselves for future tasks such as college projects and career projects when they create their own summer projects in high school. 
3228	So, what is the point on arguing about whether students or teachers should create the summer projects? These projects set up the students for what is coming in the following school year. The knowledge and skills used in previous classes are still needed for the upcoming classes. However, when students are able to be creative and make their own projects, those skills and knowledge would never leave them. In fact, teachers would be amazed at how advanced the skills of their students are because the students were actually interested in learning more to create an amazing summer project. 
3229	Have you ever felt the rush of winning first place or crossing the finish line? Have you ever been so determined you feel like your body will explode? Doing an extracurricular activity gives kids the privilege to have a hobby and feel good about themelves. 
3230	because it makes kids happier, 
3231	they meet new people, make new friends, 
3232	learn important skills along the way, that can be crucial for future situatons. 
3233	It has been scientifically proven, that doing an activity outside of school has made students happier than the kids that sit around or barry themselves in piles of schoolwork. 
3234	There was a study at Oxford University a few years ago, back in 2016. They examined the affect of fifty college students attitudes and mood throughout one month, with twenty-five of them doing an activity unrelated to school, and the other twenty-five who didn't participate in an extracurricular activity. After a month of research and testing, the professors at the univerisity got their results. It was proven that the students that did do something unrelated to schoolwork, were much happier, had higher levels of dopamine, good grades, and were able to fuction through their daily lives with barely any obstacles or problems. However, the students that didn't participate in anything had lower levels of dopamine and were a lot more stressed out. Then, because of this, their grades were affected drastically. Doing an activity like track or joining a club would be better for a students mental health. 
3235	An extracurricular doesn't just make kids happier, students can meet a lot of people and make new friends.  Doing an extracurricular activity will help people branch out, meet new people, and make new friends, possibly some important ones 
3236	"Three years ago, I joined an organization called ""Girls on the Run."" They focused on running, races, and track. Then, at the end of the year, we would participate in a race called a 5K, which is a three mile run. At first, I was insanely nervous. My body would shake, and I would sweat dramatically. The other people that joined used to be a bunch of people I had never met or talked to before, but in the long run, I made great memories with them. All of us became very close, to the point where we were almost inseperable, and did everything together. All of us are still friends to this day, and hope to be for years to come. Doing an extracurricular gives kids a chance to branch out in their community, and make great friends along the way, that'll possibly stick beside them for a lifetime. Then, since an activity gives students a chance to branch out, they could learn very important life skills. "
3237	Participating in an extracurricular gives kids a chance to branch out, and also learn very important skills that'll help them in the future. 
3238	My mom did Science Olympiad when she was younger, and was able to get to the national championship one year. Sadly, another team beat them, but my mom learned something very important that day. She learned that it was okay to loose, and how to accept that it will happen again in the future. Ever since then, when she lost something, she accepted it, and wasn't upset. My friend Generic_Name, from elementary school used to do track with me, but moved onto another sport. She was unbareably talented, and was as fast as a cheetah. When she won her first championship, she learned how to be humble, and learned not to think that she was better than anyone else on our team just because she won the championship. She didn't just do that though, she was able to encourage other people on the team to be humble as well, and not to brag if you did really good on something. In later situations, she knew not to brag or boast about the fact that she did better than someone else. Doing an activity helps people be better, and could help the students of the school be better as well. 
3239	Doing an activity outside of school would help the students be better people, and help them collect better personality traits. 
3240	They'll become happier and less stressed out from other things going on, like problems with family or schoolwork, which will have a positive affect on their grades, family life, and social life. This, can lead to even more success in the future. Lastly, they can create lifelong friends, and meet more people which can help them get how used to introducing themselves to other people, and get used to the situation. This is another important skill for the future that is taught by an extracurricular. 
3241	Swimming in the ocean, getting a tan, boating, and fishing are all exciting activities for the summer; in contrast, a school project is not, especially one without clear instructions.  A school project that is completely student-designed is unfathomable for many Elementary, Middle, or High School students because of the stress it would create during a time of recovery.  Many teachers give summer assignments, but allow for students to do the work, that was required to be completed over the summer, during the school year.  Although projects with specific instructions by the teacher can be tedious, many could argue that coming up with a rubric for ones self would be of greater difficulty.  In the event that schools make summer projects mandatory, it is the responsibility of teachers to make sure students learn necessary information and achieve the goals of the project. 
3242	A psychology teacher conducts a final exam each year in the form of a project in which students choose a topic and are not given instructions besides to relate it to psychology; consequently, she has found this project to be a hassle more than an excitement for both her and some of her students. 
3243	The process of completing a project goes smoother when given rules to follow and, within those rules, allowing students to express themselves even more than that of a guideline-free project. 
3244	When completing homework or classwork in which students must research to learn what the next unit will entail allows students a chance to learn more than what is required and provides students the ability to learn even before the information is taught. 
3245	Many students would jump at the opportunity to get ahead on the information for the next school year and many may not enjoy the requirement, but appreciate the opportunity.  Giving clear instructions provides the structure to learn and get ahead before the race for grades begins.  A summer project in which the students are designing and planning does not insure they will continue to learn during their break, but instead assures teachers that students will attempt to make it as non complex and superficial for themselves as possible.  Providing students with the opportunity to design their project uniquely with no specifications needed enables them to be lazy in the creation of the project and miss critical information for the subject that the project is on.  Students come up with many ways to avoid in depth descriptions of a topic because of the lack of motivation to do so.  With clear instructions, students will be able to find the information the teacher wants and needs in order to grade the project, and the information needed to elaborate on this knowledge in the beginning of the school year.  Students want the ability to enjoy the summer and with the specific necessities for the summer project highlighted, they will not have the stress of creating a project from scratch. 
3246	Many people have found student-designed projects to be more time consuming, although less tedious, and will overall take away from the main purpose of summer vacation which is to recover from the stress induced during the school year. 
3247	summer is a time for rejuvenation and recuperation; therefore, requiring an abstract project during this time is inadequate to the idea that many students are unable to complete such a task based on prior engagements, no structural support to aid in finding information needed, and upholding the sole purpose of summer.  Students do not want the stress of the school year carried over into the summer and neither do teachers, for students may find the need to contact teachers about what they can and cannot do if there is not a rubric they are able to follow. 
3248	students would be practicing for a future of independence, where they would be the main person dictating what their work should reflect. Students would have to practice planning ahead to ensure their work reflects their full potential, rather than rushing into work and creating something sub par. Another positive related to student-planned projects is that students would be more prepared for future experiences. Students would have an opportunity to lightly touch on skills required throughout adulthood and outside of school. They would be practicing time management as they plan for their project within their own schedule. Students would also be practicing self-reliance as their project would be fully based on their own efforts. Further, a student-designed project would reflect the student by what work they present. By choosing what they create, the student's the effort and energy put into the project would be represented in their work. It also shows their own work ethic, as the quality of the project would highlight how much they valued completing the project in a well-reflected manner. 
3249	Although some may state that it is better for teachers to design summer projects, it is actually better for these projects to be student-designed. This is the case due to students being more creative, effective, and independent in their own work as they control the factors that make up their project. Those who believe it is better for teachers to design summer projects may state that set guidelines ensure the project is done efficiently and makes sure that it is done right, but this is not true. This is an ongoing debate due to these projects being one of the major sources of academic stimulation for many students during the summer, which leads back to the idea that students should design their own summer projects as it would add many individual benefits during this time period. 
3250	When designing a project over the summer, a teacher's design will be more structured, with a clear goal for the overall project.  
3251	with teacher's knowing what skills and materiel students need to learn, they will be able to design a proper and well throughout project that will keep the students on their feet. 
3252	when it comes to summer, the last thing on a students mind is school based learning. So, lots of students will either procrastinate or create a poorly designed project leading to no continuation of learning over the break 
3253	A teacher is someone who has learned the ins and outs of school based learning, who went to college and received a teaching degree, and has a specialized learning in usually one or more subjects. 
3254	Summer for students resembles a break from school. Whether that means traveling to the Bahamas or staying home, a student does not want even the slightest thought of school in their mind. 
3255	Some might say that student-designed projects allow a more personalized and creative component. Additionally, students will be able to design a project they enjoy learning. 
3256	When it comes to summer projects, teachers should be the ones designing them. They are specialist in learning and know what further steps students need to take to learn. With the teachers clear design instructions and guidance, it will make summer learning much easier and efficient. Teacher designed projects aren't just helpful for students but teachers as well. When grading or examining the projects, that they designed, it will be easier for them to grade and compare to other students. So when in comes to whether summer projects should be either student-designed or teacher designed, teacher-designed is the way to go and will assure a continuation of learning during the summer break. 
3257	Just as crisp Autumn air rolling just around the corner and summer is coming to a bitter sweet ending. Then OH NO!  You completely forgot about that pesky summer assignment your teacher gave you. You were supposed to read one book every week and write an analysis. This is what its like for every student young or old when given a summer assignment. 
3258	it gives students the opportunity to create something they will enjoy 
3259	held accountable for as well as giving teachers a break.  
3260	The projects given to students over the summer are nine times out of ten busy work. A very large assignment most of the time having to do with reading and then writing about how you feel about that particular topic assigned. When a student is given busy work there is no real learning happening. If students create their own projects this very issue can be avoided as they can change and adapt their project so they are genuinely learning. 
3261	"Students know how much work they are able to do as well as the skill level required for their project. When students create their own projects its always going to be able something they enjoy, making it easier for them to do the project and be held accountable for it. Students are also able to create their own project knowing they are being graded not on the standard for everyone else but the standard for themselves. This takes a lot of pressure off of students as they feel like they will be graded fairly as long as long as they do as much as they are capable of doing and do it well. If the student does not complete the project for whatever reason it is much easier for them to be held accountable for it, as excuses like ""I didnt understand"" or ""It was to hard for me"" will become invalid because they are the ones who create the project. Thus making it clear that student designed projects will benefit everyone and insure work is being down. "
3262	Some people who believe that teachers should design summer project may argue that because they are the ones that create student assignments and projects for students on a day to day basis they would be able to create a project more efficiently in comparison to a student. 
3263	Although what people with these beliefs fail to realize is that teachers are humans too and they get tired. Teachers wait for the summer to come just as much as students and to have them create an entirely new project towards the end of the year can be very tiring after having a year full of creating assignments. When the students create their own summer project it allows for teachers to be able to relax and take some weight off their shoulders as the day until summer slowing come. 
3264	Another argument that could be made as to why teachers should make summer projects is that teachers will create projects tailored for the student as they work with them the whole year 
3265	but this is in fact wrong. Teachers are one person and are not able to create strong bonds with every students they come across. Typically the project given is one standard made to fit everyone but thats not possible as everyone is not the same. This is why students should be allowed to create their own summer projects.  
3266	All in all student should be given the opportunity to create their own summer projects. This because students will create something they enjoy and will do. It will also give teachers with one less project to make. After all why take the hard way when allowing the students to design the project themselves can be just efficient with less work for both students and teachers. That is exactly why students should be allowed to create their own summer projects. At the end of the day everyone just wants to enjoy their summer the best way possible.  
3267	students' lack of motivation, 
3268	students having inadequate knowledge of content, 
3269	They tend to procrastinate a lot, especially during the summer. Students may go on summer vacation or have plans with friends; whatever the reason may be, many do not think of summer assignments as a priority. Teachers also have summer break, which many people tend to forget. If summer assignments were student-designed, teachers would most likely have to do routine progress checks, because of the lack of motivation shown by students. This would be inconvenient for both the teacher and the student. Although summer assignments are not necessarily a main priority, they are still vital for the upcoming school year, especially if a student is taking an honors class.  
3270	Direction of content is almost, if not always, provided by the teacher. Teachers plan summer assignments ahead or use ones from previous years; however, they typically do not plan out the syllabus for the upcoming school year before summer break, mainly because it is too early and many adjustments can be made. 
3271	It must be taken into consideration that students would have varying opinions, considering what classes they are taking and/or will be; some may think that an assignment is asking for too much, while others may think it is asking for too little. 
3272	Although allowing students to create their assignments would most likely be more enjoyable for them, 
3273	there is a higher chance it would make them less prepared for the course. Students would struggle to maintain responsibility towards the assignment. 
3274	As there are many benefits to having student-designed summer assignments, they are less reliable than if the assignment were to be teacher-designed. Teachers have a better understanding of the content, are well-prepared, and can answer questions easily. Although students may find it less enjoyable, they are incapable of producing an assignment that would help them be the most prepared for the course. Students' lack of motivation, inadequate knowledge of content, and difficulty of coming to agreements all make it unfeasible.     
3275	I do agree with the decision of students participating in a extracurricular activity like, sports or working on a specific project or idea. Even working with council members. 
3276	Schools that require students to continue learning during the summer will see positive results in students academic lives. Designated work from teachers will greatly help alumni master and perfect classroom skills. Not to mention, students will acquire more knowledge on these areas with the extra help that was provided. If the teacher knows what their students need to work more on, those students will soon be ready to take on anything once school is in cession again. If students were given the liberty to pick their projects, would the students actually learn from it? What happens if the student chooses an easy project, when they could have been working on some other topic that they know they have trouble with? This will certainly not be a good idea. As professionals, teachers know what is best for their students if they have been observing their classroom performance. However, Many teachers sometimes overlook a few things in which student have trouble with. When this happens the student should take a step forward and let their teacher know what it is they think they need to work. This way the teacher can look back and verify is this person does need to practice more in the areas that they may be struggling. 
3277	Venus is the second planet in the Milky Way solar system, that is so close yet so mysterious. Its conditions are unhabitable and unsafe for humans, making Earth seem safe despite some dangers it also has. Venus may well have also been covered with oceans like Earth currently has. 
3278	"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents "
3279	hovering 
3280	silicon carbide 
3281	mechanical computers.  
3282	"The author says NASA has an idea on how to send humans to study Venus, ""...possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray"" (Paragraph 5). The ship would hover above, avoiding the dangerous conditions by remaining away from it. Allowing the scientists to be close enough to study some elements of Venus, and to have more context on how to understand it more, without a human possibly dying. To further support this, the author states, ""...hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight..."" (Paragrah 6). The author is aware that hovering is not the most effectove technique, but he supports the idea by hinting it will still be worth it because information can still be gathered, despite the limits. "
3283	He explains although samples of rock, gas or anything else cannot be gathered, due to the distance, challenges can motivate scientists to progress on more ways to study Venus, to apply more knowledge. He clearly shows his opinion that the dangers should not be limited by dangers or doubts, but should drive humanity to excellence and advancement. 
3284	He does not support this idea throughly, giving limited information to convice the reader of his claim. He only says it can last in challenging conditions for a limired amount of time, but does not mention any support, leaving silicon carbide as his weakest support on how using that, can convice people that Venus is a worthy pursit depsite the dangers it possesses. He uses only one fact, but not not give enough anaylsis to make his argument strong or very clear. 
3285	"A project called mechanical computers was first evisioned in the 1800s. The author further supports how its worthy by stating, ""...these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all"" (Paragraph 7). He describes it as safer, since gear usually ensures that someone will not be exposed to a certain conditon in a inhabitable environment for humans. He further argues that modern computers are more fragile in extreme conditions, and are not as strong as mechanical computers. He strongly supports it by comparing it to other popular technologies, ""...imagine exposing a cell phone or tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin"" (Paragraph 7). He explains in comparison, that systems using mechanical parts are far more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces, unlike modern technology. He uses well thought out support and evidence, to argue that Venus is actually a worthy pursuit even with the dangers it gives. He believe that studing Venus will lead to challenges that will further evolve humanity and help it prosper.  "
3286	"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author supports Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presnts through his analysis of hovering, silicon carbide, and mechanical computers. He supports his ideas with evidence and also the analysis he has with his knowledge by research. He uses facts, and not a lot of opinions to express his ideas and belief that Venus is a worthy pursuit. He colcudes his argument that humanity's travels on Earth and beyond should never even be limited by threats of dangers or doubts. Without that, knowledge will be expanded and fuel the innovation of the human world and beyond. "
3287	Technolgy has become a everyday thing in our lives and has created many distractions for students. With this new technology students could continue focusing on what's important, their school work. 
3288	"This would make students grades improve and allow them to have a better oppurtunity in the real world. Occording to the text, the technology would also allow ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."" This means the technology could adjust itself to learn how the student works, instead of the other way around. Also ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" meaning that the technology would work for each student around the world. "
3289	This technology would also create a better living environment across the globe. This is because computers could explain lessons to students in ways a human couldn't. 
3290	"The computer could analzye the students face, see any confusion, and change the lesson plan into what the individual student needs. This is all plausible because the text omits that the technology ""could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."" This could make jobs easier for teachers, and increase the future generations knowledge by teaching them more than a human could. "
3291	This technology could seriosly improve schools for the better and allow them to forever change how we learn. Students could be individually taught, and they would always learn because the computer would still know if the student is confused or not. This could create worldwide peace because students could fully grasp from histories mistakes and continue to forever make the world a better place.   
3292	they are the experts, 
3293	students will put in little to no effort in making the project meaningful.  
3294	Because they are well educated in the subject, they are able to create a project that is both relevant and useful to the students education. For example, my AP US History teacher is well knowledgeable about the history of the United States. Before the school year began, she assigned a project in which a student has to portray freedom in a piece of art. By doing this, she is able to connect freedom in history into a project that can create deep thought towards the subject. 
3295	Teachers also control the classroom and decide what to do for the education of their students. 
3296	As a student, I am able to see the hard work put into teaching a class. My teachers have to create the lessons, teach the information, grade paperwork, and much more. However, there is also the aspect of making sure that the students are controlled enough to have the needed information get across. This goes hand in hand with the knowledge of the teacher in the subject. Due to their position of power and the expertise they acquired, teachers know what to do for the education of students. 
3297	Some may say that students should design these summer projects in order to exercise freedom and creativity. 
3298	However, because teachers are the experts and oversee the education of their students in their position, they know what and how to use projects for the students benefit. Both the teacher will exercise their position as a leader and student practice their creativity with the freedom these projects allow for. 
3299	Students, after a tiring school year, want to relax during their summer break. By allowing students to design the project, they will create it in an uncaring way in order to get it over with. Students will not put the effort in both designing and finishing the project. This will create no benefit, growth, or thought in their education and academics. A personal example revolves around a project my English teacher once gave out. There was no prompt and no requirements other than a works cited. This created a hard time for students to figure out what they needed to do. As seen by this example, allowing students to design their own projects will create no benefit or direction. Without the direction of a teacher, students will not know what or how to do anything that is needed of them. 
3300	allowing students to design summer projects is not the most beneficial. This is because the teachers know the information, teachers are in charge of the classroom, and students will have no motivation to create and finish the project. As experienced in personal life and much more, too much freedom is not always for the best.  
3301	"With these two reasons we can determine the value that they would have in schools. grades would get better, some may inspire to work harder because someone or something can tell they are confused and need help. Another quote that can support my claim is that ""Most human communication is nonverbal,including emotional communication,"" ""so computers need to under stand that, too."" What this means is that the one kid who is afraid to speak up and ask questions or the kids who cant speak at all will get better help, because the computers can identify what emotions they are feeling and help them. "
3302	I know that there are some down falls to this technology what if the student or the person doesn't have a problem and just has a face that makes it look like he/she has a problem. 
3303	It allows you to travel places you have not seen before and experienece new things. 
3304	My overall thought on becoming a Seagoing Cowboy is amazed by all the good you would be doing for the world. 
3305	In conclusion the reasons for exploring Venus include how close it is to the sun, how similar it is to Earth, and how it could have supported life forms long ago. Yes, it is very dangerest because of high temperature and pressure. But if we come up with a way to lower the temperature and pressure it will be surely worth the work put in. These reason are way we should try to visit Venus in the future. 
3306	The developement of these cars should be stopped immediately because there are too many hazardous and dangerous events that could occur. 
3307	the driver will be alerted when they will need to take over the driving responsibilites of the car. 
3308	This is such a dangerous thing because we all know that whenever humans get their attention drawn in on something interesting it is hard to draw their focus somewhere else. The article explains that companies are trying to implement vibrations when the car is in trouble. Their are some people out there who do not feel vibrations and therefore would not be able to take control of the car when needed. The article also states that companies are trying to put in-car entertainment into the car while it is being driven. This is just another thing that will distract the person who is supposed to be ready at all times to take over driving when asked to do so. 
3309	Another thing that can go wrong with these cars is any type of techological malfucntion. 
3310	Every person with any kind of technological device has experienced some sort of error. Now imagine if your car has an error technologically and it takes the life of one your loved ones. The article talks about sensors around the car that read the surroundings of the car and that is what helps he car to drive without a true driver behind the wheel. Those sensors could have a malfunctions and be sensing something that is that even there and make a left turn into a 100 foot deep lake. The vibrations that cause the driver to be notified to drive could malfunction and now the driver has no way of knowing that the car is in trouble and now you, the driver, and the rest of your passengers are being buried in your local cemetery. 
3311	who to blame for the wreck if there were possibly some sort of technological malfunciton or even some sort of human error when taking over the driving aspect. 
3312	Should the manufacturer of the car be blamed or should it be the driver? No one knows because there is so many different factors that attribute to who to assign the blame to. Some of what will have to be made is a judgement call. When it comes to insurance and having to pay for any damages you do not want someone to have to make some sort of judgement call. What if that judgement call that was made was the wrong call? Now there are going to be even more lawsuits today in our courts than there already are. This problem alone will just lead to many more issues today in the world that should not have to be dealt with. 
3313	"I think that's crazy! If kids don't have and opportunity to play a sport because of their ""C"" that's no reason to take away their dream. What if they want to become a professional swimmer? You're just going cut down their dream tree just because of a ""c'? "
3314	it would not be waste of time when you get to know how our community can be a better place for us. 
3315	students should know that the program is about our own lives, because if our community is bad well our lives are going to be bad. due to that students will want to participate and will want to make our community a better place for us. 
3316	Millions of students from various cultures and locations have a common distaste for school. Many of them confidently argue that learning from home would be much more comfortable and conducive to their learning, for they would not be limited by the pressures of an academic atmosphere, which include intimidating teachers, competitive classmates, and uncomfortable classrooms. 
3317	Although many believe that students would benefit from attending classes from their homes, students would, in reality, be negatively affected by distance learning, 
3318	for they would be deprived of social interactions 
3319	hands-on experiences 
3320	personalized guidance from teachers. 
3321	Through online schooling, students would not be allowed opportunities to interact with their peers, inhibiting the development of their social skills. Instead of collaborating with their classmates, students enrolled in online schools would have to complete assignments independently, limiting the sharing of ideas. Without the opportunity to share and discuss ideas, students would not be able to develop significant social skills, which include patience, open-mindedness, and the ability to peacefully collaborate.  Without such skills, the students would be at a great disadvantage in future endeavors requiring teamwork, which are commonly presented throughout adulthood. 
3322	Without physically attending school, students would exhibit delays in social development, severely impacting their future affairs. 
3323	Additionally, distance learning does not allow for the same hands-on experiences as physical schooling does.  
3324	In traditional science classes, for example, students participate in laboratory investigations regarding pertinent aspects of their studies. Through such activities, students are allowed to apply their knowledge and reasoning skills to create memorable understandings of the investigated topics.  Online schools, however, cannot offer such activities, confining students to less involved and therefore less effective means of learning. Without interactive activities, students of online schools would not be able to obtain enduring understandings of learned concepts, ultimately limiting their educational horizons. 
3325	Furthermore, online schooling deprives students of personalized experiences with instructors. 
3326	In physical schools, students can casually ask their teachers for assistance and instantaneously receive aid. Through online schooling, however, teachers are not as accessible, for students are only able to contact their instructors during a specific time frame. Without readily available guidance from an instructor, students would be unable to receive convenient, understandable explanations of troublesome topics. Without such guidance, content would be much more challenging to comprehend, ultimately impairing the students' academic capabilities. Due to the lack of access students would have to their teachers, online schooling would not be conducive to academic success. 
3327	Overall, while online schooling would allow more comfort for the students, it would greatly inhibit their academic affairs, for they would not have access to crucial aspects of educational development, including social interaction, interactive experiences, and individualized relationships with educators. Without these fundamental components, students would not acquire lasting, solid educations, limiting their career possibilities and therefore the quality of their lives.  To optimize the educational as well as general quality of future generations, physical schooling must be promoted rather than the attendance of school from home.   
3328	Would you change history? Some people think that there some things that were made by our past Presidents should be changed. Such as our Electoral College, people say it should be changed to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. 
3329	The advancement of technology has allowed for the development of mass communication and the globalization of information that continues to revolutionize modern society. During this modern age, society revolves around technological innovation which brings up the question of whether digitally advancing the education system to better replicate the technological world is in actuality beneficial to students. 
3330	The educational curriculum that incorporates virtual courses is providing a beneficial opportunity 
3331	because students won't miss classes due to environmental or structural school issues 
3332	they would save a lot of money 
3333	their schedule would be more flexible to account for non-academic opportunities in life. 
3334	Firstly, the primary reasons why schools get canceled and have to plan extra days within the school year is because of the fear of dangerous weather conditions that threatens the safety of the student body. 
3335	One of the main weather conditions that causes schools to cancel is heavy snow where ice would form on sidewalks and roads which creates hazardous conditions for students who walk to school and for school buses to drive on. The solution for weather cancellation issues is distance learning because students would benefit from having easy access to a mentor who would continue to educate them through the Internet while they are safely at home 
3336	Another external issue that can cause harm or cancel school for students is when schools are under reconstruction which creates distractions and hazardous areas within the school that can threaten the safety of the student body. 
3337	Video conferencing would allow students to simply learn within the peaceful and safe environment of their home without without the fear of being injured or interrupted. Online courses ensures that students' learning process won't be delayed due to external factors to guarantee that students are properly prepared for final exams during the end of the school year. 
3338	Secondly, students would benefit greatly from attending classes at home because they would save a lot money on transportation and on school lunch fees. 
3339	School expenses would overall be reduced if students are able to attend online classes because some students face the unfortunate circumstance of not having a school bus assigned to their specific neighborhood which means that their parents' car mileage and car fuel are being rapidly used up in order for them to have a source of transportation to school. Online classes, in contrast, would simply require students to walk to a quiet environment within their home to ensure that they can maintain a focused mindset that is ready to learn through either reading an online textbook or participating in a video conference. Another expense when attending a physical school are the school lunches which are priced from one to five dollars depending on the county or school system and can accumulate to an enormous amount of money for middle class students who eat school lunches everyday. Distance learning, on the other hand, would allow students the ability to eat at home without the need for their parents to pay additional fees and students with a variety of health issues or allergies can also control the ingredients of the foods they are consuming to ensure that they are not deteriorating their health. 
3340	distance learning courses are beneficial for students whose family are on a budget because the affordability of online courses surpasses the attendance of a public school when accounting for all the additional taxes and fees that are put onto students who are attending a physical school. 
3341	Thirdly, students would have a more flexible schedule that would allow them to account for new job opportunities and volunteering hours. 
3342	Private and public schools are forcing their students into a regime and strict schedule that takes up the majority of the mornings and afternoons of their students' life which disables them the ability to apply for internships or well paying part time jobs that occur during typical school hours. Online classes would allow students the ability to choose the time for their classes which forces students to practice prioritizing responsibilities and improve on their time management skill. An example of students who mostly work while attending school are college students who have to pay for their attendance and possibly even lodging within the college campus. Virtual classrooms would allow these students to build their work portfolio while also allowing students to return home after work and finish their academic assignments at home during nighttime. Another reason as to why online courses' flexible schedule is beneficial for students is because they would be able to have enough time during daylight hours to volunteer and help give back to their community which builds the morals and social connections with others in the community while also allowing the students to formally engage in academic studies at home after they've finished volunteering. Students would greatly benefit from online classes where a flexible schedule will allow students to have more time to engage in different experiences in life and formulate a more balanced lifestyle that isn't fully revolved around academics. 
3343	In conclusion, distance learning is beneficial for students where it ensures that the students' education isn't hindered by uncontrollable weather conditions and it helps ease financial stress that low income and middle class families experience in a capitalist society. But most importantly, it allows students to have more independence which builds their character and further prepares them for the adult world where they are gradually gaining new responsibilities and experiences in life which they wouldn't be capable of experiencing without the flexible schedule that online courses allow. Virtual education is both effective and beneficial for the rising digital youths of America.  
3344	The student would probably not do a good job at what they were doing if they did not want to do it. 
3345	For example if a student was to tutor a child from an elementary school and they did not want to they might tell the elementary student the wrong answers on purpose because they do not want to be there. 
3346	As long as you have the proper tools to let the students at this school have a chance to do community service I believe that several of them will take that opportunity 
3347	I suggest that you put brochures in the office for tutoring sessions, trash pick up, paper routes, and any other form of community service you can think of, so that children will have the chance to do some community service. 
3348	Furthermore, I am ashamed to say that each state has its own amount of representitives. We should have a universal number of representitives for each state 
3349	even though this happens on very rare occasions the electors have the power to vote for whoever they might choose. Which also causes stress on the voters, this is due to the unconfirmed assumption that they might not be voting for who they claim to be. 
3350	Direct voting instead of using the outdated, unfair Electoral College voting would be a great update to the United States. Beniffiting the voters, electors, and the elected.      
3351	The adrenalin that you receive from sports is both vigorous and thrilling. However, if students are prevented from doing the one thing they enjoy and are passionate about, it takes away from apart of their lives and persona 
3352	Having a C average is still passing and that's what we should contemplate on, not a B average. If we eliminate the sport activity from the child it wont benefit them 
3353	This would only lower their self esteem, 
3354	cause them to be less healthy 
3355	make them believe they wont be successful without playing the sport they love. 
3356	Self esteem is a problem in most of our generation's children. 
3357	They worry about their self image and what people think. However, while playing a sport they are engaged in something they love and they are no longer fixated on what people think about them. When children enter a sport they require practice and getting in shape. So, if a student is out of shape and has insecurities they work that extra lard off by entering a sport. Their grade should not be the reason to if they can participate in a sport or not.  
3358	Also, our school offers an excellent class called health. Moreover, they tell us that we should exercise because it helps us in the long run. But, if we take that away because of grades the kids may become more lethargic and not being able to even keep up with a C average! The effects would make the child's grade lower and possibly their status as a student would drop also. 
3359	Teachers say well if we keep on letting them play their sport then they wont try to keep their grades up at all 
3360	No, that is not entirely true. A way to fix this predicament is to have consequences and tutors. 
3361	For example, if a basketball player receives a 65 on a test. Tell them that they can't start their next game unless they can pull it back up. Also, if you have tutors ( especially for the ones who struggle in math) it could help then bring their grades up to a B and possibly an A. These kids don't purposely try not to accomplish As its just hard for them to do it. All they need is a push. 
3362	Some students know that they are exceedingly well at playing their sport. But, on the other hand, they know that they do not achieve so much academically. 
3363	So, they aspire to do well in a sport and when that is taken away from them based on how they perform in class they believe they wont be successful in life and if they think that way then they most likely wont try to be. 
3364	For instance my friend, RELATIVE_NAME, was the best football player I knew. Just by the looks of him, he was destined for greatness. However, his school followed the policy to where people who were involved with sports and activities had to have a B average. Well, RELATIVE_NAME wasn't the sharpest tool in the shed and could only keep up with a C average so he had to be kicked off the team. Unfortunately, now he can't even keep his grades up to a D and has failed a grade. And, this was all because he was snatched away from the one thing he loved. Now, he doesn't even care what his grades are because he knows that he wont be able to play foot ball. 
3365	Sports and activities are a passion for people that runs through their veins like nobody's business. So, what would be the benefit of the school taking that away? Nothing. Children get involved in activities because they love it and they would rather do nothing else. If we strip them from that then what else do they have to cause them to be ambitious in life? It's hard to tell but we know they wont have a passion. 
3366	It is possible to have a tiwe because there is an even number (538) of electors, But for a tie to happen is very unlikly. (source 3). Having no tie will ensure that we have a Presidnet that a majority of the citizen and even non-citizens are happy with. 
3367	"NO region north, south,east, or west has enough electoral vote to elect a president (source 3). This ensure that one reigion that ""favourites"" on candidate has the majority say. "
3368	When chossing a president remember that your one vote will not have a great effect on who is president but the electoral college does. Having both popular vote and electoral college vote will allow all citizen to be involed in the slection of your presient. Getting rid of it my allow more of the non congress citizen to have more of a say. The congress is part of our country to and they should be able to vote the way they want to.   
3369	Do you know what the Electoral College is? It's a process that the founding fathers established in the Constitution as a compromise between election of President by a vote in Congress and election of President by popular vote of qualified citizens. 
3370	I think that we should change the way we vote by changing to election by popular vote for the President of the United States. I feel that this is a good idea and a good way to vote, let me tell you why. 
3371	It's a good idea because it benefits the public 
3372	everyone knows exactly what kind of impact they're making 
3373	it doesn't mess up the votes and or voting 
3374	The public wants to know exactly who and what they are voting for, they want to know exactly what their vote means to the election. More than half of the time they don't notice what kind of an impact a vote can make or what exactly they are voting for. Also when they do elect a President, the end up getting mad over their finances or taxes because the President trhat they voted for affected it in a negative way. They wanted to elect him because they wanted a better economy, to benefit them, not to restrict them from not having what they want. 
3375	According to the Gallup pole in the 2,000, taken shortly after Al Gore, thanks to the quirks of the electoral college, won the popluar vote but lost the presidency. Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. This is what im talking about people. People are losing their elections due to the electoral college. One of the major reasons of why people are wanting a change, there should be no electoral college, only a popular vote for the election. We all want a better Government. I only there was a better way to vote. 
3376	Well, there you have it. My reasons are final. I feel that we should change the voting process because it would benefit the public, so everyone can know exactly what kind of impact they're making and so it does not mess up the voting process. Don't do it for the government. Do it for your own sake. If you wanna make a difference, be on my side, and we can. Together. Now my only question to you is, are you willing to make a difference?            
3377	A C is a passing grade, and trying to keep up a grade B while playing sports could sometimes be really hard. 
3378	it is really hard to keep up with your grades, and school and other important things students may have to do outside of school. 
3379	maybe they have a job, friends, family, personal things they are dealing with or have to do, and making that change will push them over the edge and stop them from playing. Also a C is a passing grade so the students are passing their classes and keeping up with school and everything else while playing a sport they love, so there isn't really any need to change the grade average. It is just unfair to the students. It is just too much for the kids to handle. it will hurt them not help them. 
3380	the best part about school besides friends is sports. 
3381	what's the point? everything is fine just the way it i. why change it? 
3382	the students are keeping up their grade, and when their grade is getting lower (to a low c) the coach talks to them, saying that they better be careful. it scares the students to be getting a c because that's the boundary line. they shoot for getting an A or B anyways so it wont make a difference. It is just going to scare the kids. Also by changing the grade average it is most likely going to bring down the team numbers. Not as many kids are going to try out because of that. changing even just a little thing makes a big difference, and changing this will make even a bigger difference. 
3383	there is no need to change the grade average to a B. There is no point to it. The team and kids are doing fine just the way it is and changing the grade average will make a big difference, and not in a good way. kids will stop trying out because there is just too much going on and they cant keep up. plus a C is a passing grade and students want to get a higher grade then that because its risky at a C itself. some kids are already struggling and raising the grade will just make it harder. Leave the average the way it is because i could guarantee you that it will not be a good idea. you don't know what kids have to do after school, or go through, and if the students and teachers and coaches are happy then what is the harm? 
3384	The pros for online education are very proactive to the needed change in the school system 
3385	flexibility, 
3386	time management 
3387	mental health.  
3388	As a current student at a in person educational school, I have first-hand experience on how time consuming school may 6 be. An online education means that you are being told what you need to have done here before a certain time and, how you are expected to do so. It throws away the possibility of time consuming dialogue that students may have with other students or the teachers getting off topic with a personal story. Doing these little things that happen frequently can turn an 8 hour system into 3 hours. In the mist of giving these students 5 more hours in the day that is 5 more hours for students to work, hang out with friends, do chores and etc. These little things let us teenagers be teenagers just a little while longer. Adding to things such as, the employment rate, students taking college classes during high school, and the amount of teens volunteering. 
3389	It gives teen the ability to be more flexible with their lives which is what we should strive for. 
3390	"Secondly, When giving a student their own time to finish their work and nothing but the guilt of not getting a good grade being their motivation, there will always linger the question of ""Will they get it done?"". To that I asked, is school not meant to teach us the tools we need to survive the ""adult world""? As teenagers we are always told to learn the importance of time management before we get into our careers and even college. However, there are no courses for these types of things but, instead we are expected to learn them through first-hand experience and natural growth. "
3391	This online school will teach students their obvious subjects such as Math, English and etc but they will subconsciously teach the importance of time management. 
3392	Students will be expected to finish these lessons on their own because, if a teens prefers to do their work early in the morning in about 2-3 hours does it matter that they're possible hanging with their friends all night. These helps us teens understand the importance of time management without throwing it in their face they subconsciously come to that conclusion on their own. 
3393	Lastly, the importance of mental health in the education system is lacking and to be quite blunt is part of the problem. 
3394	"However, my question is ""Do these outlets reach out and succeeded to out way the bullying and stress of a normal public school?""  because the answer is ""No."". "
3395	As student at a public school the amount of work that is pilled on and the emotional stress of bullying enough to fall into depression. However, these problem turn into other problems for example, as a teenager your friends become and big part of your life in terms of what makes you happiest. What the current education system fails to realize is that two days of seven are not enough to truly cherish your time. Online school eliminates the possibility of those students who are to busy because of school work and because of it have no social life. 
3396	To concluded, Online school is and will most likely always be a controversial topic for as long as those who have been to in person school are around. However, I believe it's a matter of noticing that the pros of this new way of thinking out way the cons. These truly serious issues are being over looked because our older generation are extremely set on the mind-set that all generations need to grown up as they did. Let's look to innvoatote new ways.  
3397	This giant rock formation, which stretches for about two miles from end to end, isn't uncommon at all. Actually, it is a mesa which just has shadows that cast on it a certain way, which makes it look exactly like a face. 
3398	I know what you might be thinking. How could it only be a natural landform? It looks exactly like a face, so it must have been created by something or someone. 
3399	Well, there are actually plenty of reasons why it is just a normal landform with unusual shadows. 
3400	For example, the Face was found in an area of Mars called Cydonia. Cydonia is actually known for its common Martian Mesas. This means that it isn't too shocking that it is natural. 
3401	Even though this one has strange shadows that give it features of a face, it is still just a mesa. 
3402	Even though the picture clearly showed that the Face wasn't a man-made structure, 
3403	some people still weren't convinced. They said that the picture was taken on a cloudy winter day, so many skeptics thought that maybe there were alien markings that were just hidden by haze. 
3404	No matter what people believed after they saw the picture taken in 1998, the picture taken on April 8, 2001 was the one that proved to the skeptics that the Face was a naturally occurring landform. 
3405	There you have it. The Face sadly wasn't built by aliens, it was just a natural landform that happened to have some pretty neat features to it due to shadows. There is no way around it, because the pictures don't lie. It is even more obvious that it is a landform because ones just like it exist on Earth! Even though it would've been very interesting for it to have been actually created by aliens, it was just a natural landform in the end. 
3406	You have listed two possible policies about cell phones at school. The issue is common among all schools, considering that children are texting in class. You have presented two very common ideas about cell phone usage; the first allows students to use their cell phones during lunch and other free times, while your second suggests banning students from having phones at school. While both ideas can be considered good, 
3407	They could take out and use their phones when teachers are not watching, and use them without being noticed. And when somebody gets caught, they just get angry at the school and have their parents come up to the school to get back the confiscated phone. This will give you no progress, as students would still use their phones in class and just get them taken away. Even if they have the chance of getting caught, they would still text or call somebody if they felt that it was something important. 
3408	also, students would have to use a school phone to contact a parent if they are sick or forgot something, and not all teachers allow students to use class phones. 
3409	if they do, a sick person might use the class phone, allowing the germs to spread, possibly putting other students at harm of disease. 
3410	Students could then contact friends if they do not have the same free time as them, and are able to contact a parent or guardian if they are sick. This will cut down on students using class phones, and will help stop texting going on in class. If they believe they have the liberty to text during free times and lunch period, then they will be less likely to text in class. By giving them freedom, you are helping yourself because they are less likely to break the rules if they have something to tell their friends or family and they do not need to break the school rules to tell them really quickly. They would have time to do and say whatever they wanted to friends and family, and that would cut down on students getting in trouble during class. It would also reduce the amount of parents that have to come to school with complaints and to retrieve the item that was taken away.  
3411	This will allow students to fell as if they more freedom, treating them like adults. If they feel they are treated like a grown person, they might start to act like one. 
3412	This could improve their studies if they stay more focused in class because they feel well respected. This could also help they pay attention more in class if they are not texting during the teachers lesson. The teacher can not always see if a student is texting, so the pupil could easily get away with it. During a free time, students would be able to get all of their important texts to their contacts, and be able to focus more in class. This will improve the grades of students, and help prevent students from being held back or failing a class. It could even keep kids out of trouble. 
3413	Over all, I believe that banning phones from school is a bad idea. None of the students would follow the rule, and they would just bring them to school and hide them. This will get zero progress, and will create no change in the school environment. If you let students text during free time, it could keep students from texting during class, and help them focus more. By distracting the students while they are outside or have free time, it could prevent them from doing something to get them in trouble. And less people would be angry. You would not have angry students or parents coming up to the school to take back a confiscated item, thus not having to bother with any angry people. This is where I stand on the policies, but the final decision is up to you. 
3414	Self drive cars are the cars of the future because, they can brake, 
3415	accelerate 
3416	steer on their own. 
3417	Driverless cars being able to break and stop on their own would prevent car crashes from happening. 
3418	Cars that accelerate on their own would prevent speeding, 
3419	Cars that can steer on their own would prevent a large portion of car crashes and other automobile accidents. 
3420	"The author states ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer?"" This would make the passing of the law to allow self driving cars tricky "
3421	Self drive cars are the cars of the future because, they can brake, accelerate and steer on their own. This makes them safer and more reliable. This would save lives and prevent injuries which makes them the smart choice for cars in the future, Manufactures should focus on developing self driving cars for the good of the world. 
3422	Secondly it disconnects you from your fellow peers that could've helped you when you were struggling to understand material. 
3423	Finally it blocks off the essential skill development of how to work together and with other people. 
3424	Online learning may be easier than real school but in the end it leaves you at a disadvantage and unprepared for college and life as an adult. 
3425	Learning at home through a computer may should nice but its not all what it seems. Learning can become increasingly difficult when your at home and not in a class room because when your at home it makes it very hard to focus 
3426	as you now have access to all the video games, TV and any other form of entertainment. It also means you are not under any teacher supervision which allows you to daze off and easily be distracted by pets or younger siblings. Especially in our day and age where we have cell phones, you would always be able to go on your phone whenever you'd like consequently missing what little important information your being taught. Another important factor ,that most people don't even think about, is the fact that you lose all the connections with your fellow classmates who can be valuable sources of information. 
3427	With the loss of fellow classmates it can make an impact greater than most people think. Humans are social creatures which allows us to thrive when working and collaborating with one another. Now when your taken out of that environment and placed in an environment that forces you to do all the work alone it destroys your work speed and makes it far more difficult to process and absorb information because you don't have the different perspectives or incites your classmates could have given you. Not having classmates also could make it harder to interact with unfamiliar people because when your in class your always meeting and socializing with new and unique people, now being taken out of that your no longer exposed to any of these interactions meaning you would have to relearn these social skills which could be very challenging as a teenager which could lead to worse problems like being socially awkward 
3428	Without classmates you will miss out on key social skills that may show its scars further down the road of life. 
3429	Getting along socially with other people isn't a given, we spend up to 16 years in the class room together nurturing key social skills that we will continue to use throughout our entire lives. Now imagine what would happen if you were taken out of the classroom. The effects would be devastating, you would miss out on the social development you gain from schooling and it would cause turmoil. This would be such a massive problem because social skills are a key instrument to have when in the work place, if you not able to articulate ideas and information to fellow employees properly it would strip these what wouldve been bright employees to substandard workers not fit for upper management jobs 
3430	Along with this without the key development of social skills these student that did online schooling could appear unappealing to other people leaving them lonely which would turn into depression making that person live a sad and horrible existence. 
3431	Online schooling and courses is just not the way to gain a proper education and it does more damage than anything else. Because people need other people taking them out of the class room for even one year for online schooling can have devastating impacts on the student and it may take years to reverse the damage. Risking vital aspects of success like the development of social skills and the brain is just not worth the easy courses of online schooling and should never be implemented into school systems. It sets you up to be steps be hide your peers meaning you'll always have to play catch up. In the end online schooling isn't worth the all the struggles you'll have to face as an adult and in college and its my strong recommendation that you stay away from it. 
3432	Driverless Cars need to be highly improved or not put onto the roads, you should always be more safe than sorry. 
3433	in this article it says, ¨ all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and aroung accidents¨(7). Showing how dangerous these smart cars can really be. If the car can not work properly in the condicions that are all around us, what makes them safe to have on the roads? As the cars keep devoloping the more dangerous they will become to us humans, if smart cars ever get to the point where they truly are driverless it would not be neraly as safe to be out on the roads. This is because these cars are know to have problem with changes in the road and when they notice this change they are programed to alert the human driver. Thinking of that, what if a child were to run out onto the road, how fast can this car really react, or how fast could this smart care alert the human driver? 
3434	These driverless cars should be concidered hilgly dangerous to humans for they will never have the power to oberate just as a human could. 
3435	these cars could only hurt not help human kind, 
3436	¨Originally, many futurist believed the key to developing self-driving cars someday was not so much smarter cars as roads¨(3). This idea would help solve many problems that come along with the diverless car, but therfore would cause a great problem of its own. These smart roads would be highly expensive and the only way to pay for them would be the peoples money, and that seems almost impractical. These smart roads used electrical cables and magnets to help guide the car down the road, and with these ideas you would be putting the power into the roads not the cars. And with that these driverless cars would be much saver for everyone. But these roads could never be used for that they would take way too much money to be instaled, saying that driverless cars still remain unsafe. 
3437	Overall these cars would also be very hard to get llegalised. 
3438	¨Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers¨(9). Therefore, it is already hard enough to keep the drivers alert and watching the road while they are driving now, could you imagen how hard it would be to keep people alert when they have nothing to do? These laws are there to keep people safe and smart cars are the easy way to go not the safe way. Also, serious arguments would accure that would only cause problems not solve anything. Because what if this car gets into an accident while self-driving, would it be the drivers fault or the manufacture? Could you blame it on the driver and say they should have been more alert or say that the manufacture should have made/programed their cars better? These arguments and cases would be never ending, because almost all humans do not want to be saw as guilty so they would do and say anything to get off the hook. As to say, these smart driverless cars would do a lot more harm than help. 
3439	To justify my argument that everyone should be against the development of these driverless cars, just think about if it was you. These cars can not be pradictable and no one can be postive what will really happen. But what if it was you who got hurt or maybe a family memeber, because they let these unsafe and unperdicable cars out onto the roads. You would have no one to blame because it was just a machine or just a accendent. They are never meant to hurt but everyone would rather be safe than sorry. Make the right choice and do whats right to keep people safe, not to make their lives easier. 
3440	There is more of a certainty when the electoral college is in charge 
3441	because if a voter has voted for example Obama for the electoral vote but voted for Romney for the popular vote it would be unorganized because of the split vote between popular and electoral which is recquired the majority of when in a public govermental election which could impact the whole future for the nation. The election for Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 they both had only a 43 percentage plurality of popular votes while also winning a majority in the electoral college which was (301 and 370 electoral votes) . When no candidate fully wins the majority of the votes that were casted they wouldn't have to recount the votes of have a re-election which would drain the economies money because of the high amount of money put into one election in the first place just to have another election, whereas the electoral college can just step in and rectify the situation just by producing a clear winner on their own instead of going through a long process just to find out who the clear winner is all they have to do is debate among themselves who they believe the people would be happy with in the long run .  
3442	"As Americans, we are told that we are given rights in our country. We have the freedom of speech, expression, religion, and petition as stated in our first admendment. We are also told the we have the freedom to vote once you reach certain requirements, like age and citizenship. However, are we really getting the freedom that is talked about? No. Because the Electoral College is present in today's society, our vote becomes pointless and meaningless. We become a ""popular"" vote, but really the electoral college gets to decide who becomes presidents "
3443	The Electoral College has been in our Constitution since the Constitution was approved, but we have modified simple things as in gender discrimination and race discrimination, why are we not going to change this unjust system?  
3444	the electoral college is fooling our citizens to think we have a say in our country's government. 
3445	"He elaborates further to say that ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the presidet, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. This proves my point further, because once again we do not vote for our president, we vote for the people who get the ""priveledge"" to vote for the most prestine place of power in our entire country. "
3446	The next problem with our Electoral College is that each state is given an uneven amount of representatives form each state. 
3447	If Florida voted canidate A, but North Dakota voted for canidate B, canidate A is bound to win because Florida has twenty-nine representatives and North Dakota only has three. As you can see Mr. President, this becomes a preblem because four states with only three representatives could vote for one canidate, but if Florida votes for the other one, the first canidate has already lost. 
3448	Mr. President, I have explained to you what the people want, which is to stop being lied to. However, every four years comes around, and yet I do not see a change in anything. I do not think it is only the people who are afraid of change, it is also you. But, would you want to live in a world where everyone hates the way the government works or a world where the citizens are given the rights they were promised? Mr. President it is now up to you to do the right thing. 
3449	I would have to urge you to keep the Electoral College. 
3450	The Electoral College process is in use currently, and though many people disagree with it, it would ultimately be better than popular vote. 
3451	Imagine your alarm clock goes off and you get out of bed, and after doing your morning routine instead of grabbing your book bag to heading out and catching the bus for school instead you open your laptop and open up a video chat with your teacher to get your lesson of the day instead. This idea isn't and is referred to as distance learning. Distance learning already exists in most colleges such as Generic_School and has started to develop in high schools. Many have the impression that this could be the new way to do school work. Others believe that distance learning won't bring much of a change as it says it is and have a rather niche effect in schools 
3452	Every year students end up missing days due to sickness or other matters. These sickly students almost always come back to loads of work to do that they can could not get done while they where out recovering. Distance learning can help with this near inevitable factor 
3453	Focusing on other issues, what if you don't even have schools in your area? There are several kids out in the world that live in rural locations are so far from schools that it'd even be too much to send a bus out to bring them to school. 
3454	This leaves rural students most of the time only two options:move to another house or be home schooled instead by a parent which doesn't give as good as a education as public schools. Home schooling can put a strain on the parent because most of the time it interferes with their jobs. It's unfair knowing that people fall short on education and opportunities compared to everyone else because of the area they live in. The implementation of distance learning can change this problem almost entirely for these students. Places like Australia already participate in this practice with some outback residents attending schools right form their house. No matter where you your house is, you should still be able to get your education 
3455	As great as distance learning sounds it, as with all decisions, does not come without drawbacks. Tackling possibly it's biggest problem, distance learning has a high technological dependency to function efficiently and having tech means spending lots of money.  
3456	We should be well aware of the financial problem of this idea and maybe in time someone can find a way to make this method more accessible to the masses  
3457	Distance learning is a relatively new method on how people get their education. No matter the outside conditions, distance learning can still give students their assignments for the day. This idea in other countries has proven to go beyond and into remote places and provide education to places without schools. Even with the limitations is has now, I'm sure that the use of it will most likely spread in the future. I believe that within some years that distance learning could be a practical way to do school; in fact, it could even be the primary way to attend school. 
3458	Since most of the big states already have their votes planned out on who is going to win them over, president-to-be's don't try to persuade them because they know they have those votes. Mostly they try to change the swing states, or the smaller states because they could change from Democratic to Republican during anytime in the election. If everyone had a say in the election, more people would be inclined to vote and there would be more input into who became the next 4 year leader of this nation. 
3459	But in the event that the elector is chosen and does not vote for whom he or she was elected by the people to vote for. What happens then? The wrong president is chosen because there was a fault in the system. 
3460	"After all, electoral colleges should be changed because it is better for the people so there is more of an input from smaller populated states, they will want to vote and there would be less of an ability to tie the election. Having a popular vote lets the citizens in big states that are metaphorically already ""chosen"" allows the minority vote to maybe have a chance in the office. Last but not least, it is understood that having the electoral college decreases wrong-doings, but if the elector chosen by the state changes his intentions just for himself, that gives the state no word about it.    "
3461	After researching the Electoral College process I find that the process should no longer be used. The process is not effecient for choosing the next US president and therefor the voting process should be changed to popular vote. 
3462	This makes the Electoral College not a democratic method for electing the president. This nation was founded on the belief of democracy, so when the government ignores the call for a democratic method for elections it is disrespectful towards out Founding Fathers, and especially to the citizens of the United States of America. Furthermore, state representatives may misrepresent a state, possibly by defiance. This has happened in the 2000 campaign where segregationalists defied the people and nearly succeeded in replacing the electors for those who opposed Josh F. Kennedy. 
3463	"According to source 3, ""Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote."" Larger states are paid the most attention to by canidates because they will receive more votes than compared to the number of votes a smaller state would produce. This causes smaller states to have less interest in the campaign because they know they have a lesser chance of their favored canidate winning. Even more, canidates focus on swing states. Swing states are states that can be easily convinced for votes. It is important for all states to focus on the campaign so that an unworthy or unprepared canidate is not chosen for presidency, but only large and swing states are paying attention. "
3464	The Electoral College should be rid of. The process is not democratic and misrepresents voting citizens in more ways than one. If voters were able to directly vote for canidates then more states would actively engage in the campaign and all people would be represented equally. It would lower the chance for downfall, and the chance for incidents to occur. I propose that the next presidential election should use the process of popular vote to choose the next president for the United States. 
3465	Education is a big factor in ones life. Without it, where would our society be? I am a student myself and know the difficulties and benefits of attending a physical school. Video catting just ins't the best idea for helping students develop their education. Bringing more technology into a society already involved with enough technology doesnt have a happy ending. There are more negative effects that this can bring than just attending a physical school. 
3466	and it doesn't give them the opportunity to build relationships with former students and their teachers. 
3467	Firstly, getting assignments done in class are hard enough as it is. If students are expected to get all of these assignments done at home, most of these would be completed late and/ or sloppy. 
3468	Even from my own experience, when I'm given an assignment to do in class I finish it more quickly due to the resources I have in the classroom. When assignments are given at home, it takes me longer to complete this assignment because I tend to have lots of questions that can't be answered by my parents or the internet. Video chatting isn't the same as a face to face conversation with your teacher. What if the internet is down and you're not able to communicate with your online teacher, what do you do now? As a student, I know kids aren't going to try and solve the problem, this is just another excuse they can use to as why they did not complete their assignments. Attending class at home will cause more of a stress for students because they will find other things to do that can distract them from their work. In a classroom, you have one job and that's to get your work done. Less distractions are available in a classroom when compared to your own home. 
3469	If a student were to work from home, they would choose when they want to work and if they even feel like doing assignments that day. Having this schedule teaches them time management which helps them develop the technique for the future when planning out different things. My friend, Generic_Name, has a very hard time planning things such as hanging out with friends, when to complete assignments, etc. She learned how to manage a schedule that incorporates all of her needs and wants into her day. She is able to attend school, go to soccer practice, and still have time for her friends and family. This is one of many life lessons that attending school can give you. When people think of school they think of all the work they have to complete with no time in the day to do it. By developing this schedule it helps them manage their priorities first and helps them incorporate their wants as well. 
3470	My cousin is home schooled. Her only friends are her neighbors and her teammates on her fencing team. She is a very shy girl and hates talking to people. If she were put into a school with kids her own age she might be different in the way she talks to people. This is going to effect her future in a way that might be difficult for her to get a job, buy a house, etc. Having relationships like those, with other students and teachers, makes getting through school a whole lot easier. These teachers push their students for success and online catting with teachers just doesn't form that close relationship like a teacher you see in person everyday does. I know going to school is hard and annoying, but it's those teachers and my friends that motivate me to go to school and get those positive grades. 
3471	"School is a childs job, they can't just avoid the difficulties it brings because ""they feel like it."" Students already try to find reasons to not complete assignments and giving them the opportunity to attend class from their home just gives them more of an opportunity to slack off, lose those relationships they could've made, and leaves them missing out on developing a plan for their current and future life. Attending school gives students more than the education they need, but the lessons that can be used throughout their whole life.  "
3472	COVID-19 is spreading across the world. Now this disease has killed more people than influenza has this year. Epidemiologists for the CDC are recommending that colleges across the country shut down their campuses and revert to online school so that they disperse the student population to lower the chances of the students getting infected. This suggestion has been readily accepted in colleges throughout the country. Soon public schools could follow the colleges' lead. More and more public schools are introducing a plethora of online classes. Many students are now able to do classwork and take assessments online as well as conference with their teachers from the comfort of their home. 
3473	building each students aptitude with technology for their future participation in the workforce 
3474	Currently, if a student needs help with homework or a concept that they are struggling with, most often, they will have to come and see their teacher before or after school. Some students simply do not have that availability to see their teacher or are too embarrassed to ask their teacher during the class session. With classes being taken online, the student could simply email the teacher privately to work out a time to video conference their teacher for help. This simple interaction with teachers would show that students could go to their teachers more easily and would feel more comfortable when asking questions. With this increase of inquiries, scores in the grade book could go up, increasing parental and student satisfaction. Due to the introduction of online education, teacher-student interaction would become easier and more common.  
3475	Second of all, Students would be able to become build their technological skills parallel to learning new material. 
3476	Many employers in this hyper-technological world are looking for employees that will be able to keep up with new technologies as well as help their business grow. While students are at school, they have access to technology, but this access is limited and most often very basic for most people. If schools' education was offered online, many students would rapidly become accommodated with new and more complex programs and applications. Teachers could require logging of time spent studying on spreadsheets, or taking screen shots of research, as well as making projects on three-dimensional design software for every student that they have. So many things in the classroom would have to be transferred online, making students who graduate highly valued to any employer looking to hire somebody. Highschool students who become adept at using online applications would be beneficial for a student and future employers.  
3477	Third of all, any student that has to stay at home or be hospitalized due to a sickness would be able to continue their education. 
3478	Throughout the year every school has a variety of issues, but one issue can truly devastate an education. If a student that is a tenth grader comes to school with what they think is a minor cold and goes about their entire day, many students would interact with this sophomore and soon all of these students would be home sick. Due to the transmission those classes would only have half the students it should have. This issue is morbidly obvious. However true this issue is, disease cannot spread through technology. Any students taking these online courses would be safe from any other students who are sick. This would allow schools' education to run with a little more grease on their axles. Due to students having an online education many students who become sick would not have to pause their education for any amount of time. 
3479	In order to address those opposed, it is understandable for anyone to do so, but not forgivable. Many would say that the students would lose their friends, that they might become awkward, and that students might even cheat on assessments. 
3480	Schools would be getting rid of their on campus schooling but would still host extracurricular activities and sporting events, along with gym classes, as well as dances and pep rallies. This would help retain student friendships at school. Students cheating on assessments has been a problematic in all school systems for years, writing on your arms and hands, looking at a friend's paper to see which bubbles they filled in, or even feverishly copying someone's homework in the hallways outside of a class. 
3481	While online learning may be a good fix for a lot of these issues it could open up new problems as well. Students could use their phones to search for answers to a variety of tests or share their answers with friends via text message. Their is no end to the creativity of someone who wants to cheat on an assignment, 
3482	In conclusion, online school for students could be greatly beneficial. Through one on one interaction with teachers, spurring more inquiries from pupils, becoming more proficient with technology at school and in the workplace, and allowing students who are afflicted with disease, and sometimes an injury, to attend school. Online school would benefit many students in this modern world. Now do what you think is right, go to a school board meeting, or sign a petition, because once we make this change, the Virginian education system will be stronger than any other state's. Now that isn't able to be said every day. 
3483	All student with an A, B, or a C average can play any sport they wanted to but every marking period they should have to show the coach's their progress report. 
3484	An other reason not to cancel the sports are so that all the students can stay in shape and not have any troubles with their weight. 
3485	Students should not be all closed up with nothing to do they should at least have an hour of fun in their school day at least twice a week there should be 2-3 hours of out side time to let their energy all out of their systems. 
3486	I think its a good idea because it can decrease some of the accidents thats happening 
3487	Then, i also think it can be a bad idea. The reason why i say this is because there are some people out there that will take driveless cares to there advantage. 
3488	I believe that you made the correct decision. Education is very important in a students life. Being the principal, you should enforce this rule and by doing so, would improve a students future for the better. 
3489	You should ask yourself one question and ask many other students the same question; What will get you through your life and guarantee a good future, education or sports? This question will stump all the arguments they have except for one. An athletic scholarship. 
3490	because not everyone is going to get an athletic scholarship. The odds are for getting an athletic scholarship are slim and there will be many people who are competing for it too. 
3491	there are many jobs out there that require people with an education, while as there are very few jobs that require you to be good at sports. In this world, education will get you far and having a C average isn't going to cut it.  
3492	If they spend just as much time studying as they do playing sports, then it wouldn't be a problem, but when they neglect studying just to play sports, then they are harming there future. 
3493	Think about all the futures you could save by just putting a little discipline. A C isn't very far from an F and that could jeopardize there whole life. If they study hard, they can have fun and live a good life when they get older, but having fun and neglecting studying now isn't going to give them a relaxing and fun future. 
3494	If they are trained to study hard and play sports at the same time, it will pay off because they will have to get organized and pay attention to time management. 
3495	. I strongly recommend that you enforce this rule. Just watch the events unfold when you enforce it. There grades will rise and eventually they will be accustomed to all the hard work they put in. Education is everything and will shape your life, while sports is just an extracurricular activity that might or might not get you an Athletic scholarship. 
3496	I believe that there should be no more Electoral College because it doesn't give people much of a say in who becomes President because there is just a commitee of people that are voting for the President. 
3497	"School can make some of the social challenges that certain students face more difficult and for others school can create these same challenges. Anxiety is something that many of deal with, some cases worse than others. Anxiety in the classroom is amplified. This can lead to a drop in grades and performance in school. Attention disorders such as ADD an ADHD can make school dreadful at times. Online classes that are taken at home will put the student in a comfortable space in which he or she can focus in their classes without 30 other things happening. Students can go through so much in their own lives, not to forget the fact in which we live in a world of chaos.  Tragedies, or ""interruptions"" happen in everyone's life and as students going to school is either not an option or is a very difficult one "
3498	Imagine being in a hallway with what seems like a million new faces every day and you are not familiar with anyone. Making friends is hard when you have anxiety because the most comfortable place is yourself. 
3499	A student with anxiety can be taking a test that is very challenging and tedious and the walls will seem as if they are beginning to shrink and close that student in. That is anxiety, anxiety is going over a whole conversation and going over what you will say so you dont mess up. Anxiety is scary. As you can imagine, school with 2000 kids everyday can be difficult for students. Working to overcome your anxiety can take a long time and is necessary but better results will be achieved when the student makes the decision for themselves to take classes at school rather than home because some kids just arent ready for that yet. 
3500	"You can just take a guess on why this would make school in a classroom hard. ADD and ADHD cause students to struggle to maintain focus and they both do it in different ways. Picture yourself day to day always finding yourself mentally blank, forgetting simple task, Losing your train of thought, and battling your mind trying to do a million things at once. This is the life of many students. Attention disorders can be treated with medication, however many families either cant afford the medication due to lack of health care or refuse to let their children take an addictive controlled substance. Some parents just think that there kid doesnt even try or is just ""dumb"". "
3501	The 504 plan is a plan that was made to accommodate and assist students with learning disabilities. This plan works by giving students more time to complete assignments and giving students accommodations to put them in a learning environment that will benefit them 
3502	Sadly students with learning disabilities are forgotten about and neglected. Unlike children with autism or special needs students with attention disorders take the same classes as the general population. Therefore students 504 plans are followed based on who the teacher is, and sadly some teachers dont care. This means the student will not receive any accommodations such as more time on test. This can lead to poor grades, and not because the student isnt prepared. A student with ADD will have to read a problem 5 times before they really retain the information and even then everything is done slower because when students with attention disorders try to force their brain work too fast that is when things are forgotten and missed.  
3503	Life happens. Students go through more than you can imagine. Everyday students deal with the death of loved ones, pregnancies, abuse, sickness. These are things that some adults can barely deal with. As children we are dealing with life's problems for the first time. You can see why that would take a toll on us. Life happens and students go to school and deal with bullying, racism, sexism etc. It is natural that kids who internally struggle with themselves will make others feel small to feel a sense of validation and power. It is not right but that is human nature. However some of our bullies are our very own teachers. A student can be literally be on the verge of suicide and a teacher can give a student a hard time or just be blatantly rude. Teachers are different to students than they are to adults. As an adult you cannot just treat adults any type of way without consequences. Teachers use their power over students to do this because lets be real, as students we can complain and complain and it seems like nothing ever changes because no body truly cares. As much as it is said the actions of those in power do not show it. School is supposed to be a safe space but in reality it is not. There are people who take everything that life gives them and use it as motivation and they thrive. Others are not there yet in life as students are children. The education we are gifted with is a blessing. However sometimes the people in the building are the issue. Going to school for 9 months carrying a child is very hard. Kids can be more brutal than adults. Having the ability to take your classes online at home will benefit so many children in the school system. 
3504	Students taking classes online will be very beneficial. My overall reasoning behind this is a lot of the problems that students face is because of the students and the teachers in the building. Online education eliminated those factors. Students distractions will be limited. The environment will be safer. It is sometimes necessary for students to take online classes at home therefore it should always be an option. The big picture is to make our next leading generation more educated than the last. Whatever makes that easier should be employed into our school systems.  
3505	The first and most obvious reason is safety. 
3506	A second reason is the large cost of manufacturing these cars. 
3507	And finally, a third reason we do not need driverless cars in this day and age, is people would forget how to drive a regular car or neglect to even learn if the car drove itself. 
3508	The first reason that society does not need driverless cars is safety. 
3509	Of course, people can argue that if a car were to drive itself, there would be less accidents. It is true that driverless cars could reduce accidents from drunk driving and other impaired states, or just simple driving errors. 
3510	A second reason that driverless cars are not necessary is the unimaginable cost it would be to manufacture these cars. 
3511	In addition, millions of dollars would be spent first to research and perfect the workings of the driverless cars. Not to mention, driverless cars would probably cost a larger sum of money than regular cars because of the time and cost of manufacturing them. In the past few years, in the United States has been going through a financial crisis. While our economy is now doing better, where would the money to fund these cars come from? In the article, the author mentions building smarter roads for cars. If that was the case, it would cost even more to fund this grand scheme. So much money is spent on paving and repairing roads every year, it would cost so much more to have to change or rebuild all of the roads in the country. In addition, if cars were to drive themselves, many laws would have to be changed for the new cars. Right now in the United States, one in five children will go hungry, there are clearly more important things to spend money on right now than to fund driverless cars. 
3512	A third and final reason that we do not need driverless cars is if we did, people would forget how to drive a regular car, or neglect to even learn. 
3513	The article mentions that cameras might be needed to ensure people pay attention to the road. There are already enough distractions for drivers to worry about. Texting and driving has become a major issue in recent years. Imagine how easy it would be to be distracted by a phone or other device if the car you were in were driving itself? This is a slippery slope. It starts out with relatively small things, such as not paying full attantion to the road if the car drove itself. But soon, if people did not have to worry about traffic laws and safety, then they would soon forget them. Hypothetically speaking, what if someone who had been driving a driverless for a period of time one day had to go back to driving a regular one. This person may still have their liscense, but would they be able to pass a test for it now? Problems like this would make the road more dangerous than it already is. In addition, that same person who is now driving a regular car, may forget that he or she is controlling the car, being that they were so used to the car driving itself. There is enough reckless driving, that we do not nead people operating vehicles with no memory of how to do it! Or people might even neglect to learn how to drive a regular car at all if they depended on a driverless car all the time. If society allowed this to happen, the results could be catastrophic. 
3514	In conclusion, driverless cars are not a good idea. Maybe in the distant future if more problems that we are currently dealing with are resolved, but not at this time. Driverless cars are not currently safe, and will not be for many years to come. They would cost a significant amount of money, money that can be spent elsewhere for better causes, especially when we already have cars that work perfectly fine. Finally, driverless cars are not a good idea because they could cause people to forget how to drive a regular car, which could lead to a very dangerous and potentially deadly situation. There are benefits of driverless cars, however there are even more downfalls to the idea that certainly outweigh the benefits.      
3515	"The Electoral College is something that this country needs for our benifit.  It helps us Americas get a President that will benifit us all not just those in certaint areas.  Although some peopel dont think that the Electoral College is helping there are twice as many people who believe that just a popularity vote is a bad idea.  Having swing states, and having a way that finds ""everyones"" president are just few of the many exaples about why we need the Electoral College. "
3516	"The Electoral College is as it says on the 3rd source ""widely regarded as an anchronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be [overruled] by declaring the candidates who receives the most popular votes the winner."" "
3517	First of all, I would like to start by saying that the Electoral College is helpful to avoid problems where no candidate got a majority. 
3518	"For example in the 5th part of the source 3 it says ""Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both  had only 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively)"" which backs up my claim. "
3519	"I understand the ""wrong"" part of it like in the 2nd source it says ""If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for [John] Karry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry."" meanning voters vote for a slate of electors and they choose the president. "
3520	"Second, I agree with the Electoral College despite the lack of ""democratic pedigree"" for five reasons. "
3521	"First, ""Certainty of Outcome"" meanning winning candidate's share of the Electoral College exceeds his share of the popular vote, example, Obama vs Romney. "
3522	"Second, in the Everyone's President part it says that no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president, for example, ""Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win"". "
3523	"Number 3, ""Swing States"" the ""winner takes all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates-as we saw in [2012] election-to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states"". "
3524	"There is also number 4 where the Electoral College ""restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution"" "
3525	In summation im in favor with the Electoral College for many reasons. After reading through this side and the opponing side of the argument I can honestly say that I prefer this method as it is. Yes there is a bad side to it but there is a bad side to everything and it shouldn't be big enough for anyone to oppose it. 
3526	"In this system, according to the second source, popular vote, which is what the majority people select, most of the time loses the election due to the Electoral System. An Example used in this source was the 2000 election with Al Gore, he had won the popular vote, but had lost the election thanks to the Electoral College. With this system in play, voters cannot control who they want to vote for and that is not how it should be. In source one, it clearly states most states have a ""winner-take-all"" type of system that awards all electors of that state to the specific candidate, which is the complete opposite of benefiting the people, because not everyone in that state wants to vote for that specific candidate. Source 3 says big states that a larger state gets more attention than a smaller state does because of the amount of votes, however some states claim they never even got to see a presidential campaign had because of how small the states was. Its is Unfair to these states which include Rhode Island, South Carolina. It takes away opportunities from these smaller states. "
3527	"In source two, Bradford Plumer mentions the single best argument against the Electoral College, which he calls the ""disaster factor"". "
3528	in my opinion the Electoral college process was established to prevent the option of President by popular vote that just dosnt seem fair. 
3529	Citizens are going to be angry either way the president is elected because its about who is running our country and representing it, not about how he or she is elected. 
3530	We as American citizens should have the right to choose/vote for the president we want representing our country  
3531	". From my knowledge, Under the Electoral college system, voters vote not only for the president, but for a slate of electors. ""Richard Nixon, Jimmy carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. chamber of commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time agreed on getting ride of the electoral college!"" for example Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. Why dosnt the goverment just give us what we want?  if 90% of votes go to a candidate, then why would they not get the presidency? its common sense. "
3532	As time progresses in history, we often look back and see the notable advancements humans have made over the years such as the creation of fire, the discovery of new resources like oil, and the creation of the steam engine. Advancements have also been made in learning as well, as we have gone from using chalk boards to using smart electronic boards. Now we must take learning a step further with the introduction the use of online resources when the student cannot attend a class in person. Some schools offer an option for students to attend a class with means of video conferencing or any other online means instead of attending in person. 
3533	All schools should have the option of attending classes through online means, as it will greatly benefit students, perhaps more than attending classes in person. 
3534	A student may be traveling during this time, and it may not be up to them whether they want to travel or not as their parents could force them to come along to travel with them. Or, it could be that they have to go out of town for a while due to a family emergency. The student has no control over this and therefore cannot attending the class; however, if they could access an online resource and schedule a video conference with the teacher when they are in class teaching, the student won't miss any important material and still not be in the room as well. 
3535	Schools should have the option of attending the classes through online means because the student may not be comfortable around their classmates. 
3536	Around middle and high school, classes aren't the only thing become harder, there is also pressure regarding students and their peers. Many teenage students may have a difficult time focusing in a classroom due to another students presence there which throws the student off. It could be whether it is a romantic interest, a bully, or someone who does not treat them well and makes them feel uncomfortable when they are in their presence. Or it could be that the student isn't comfortable around new people or doesn't like to be in a crowded place and prefer to be alone or in an environment in which they are used too. Regardless, it affects the student and negatively impacts their studies. If the student could attend a class through online means, or have a video conference with the teacher when they are teaching, they could still learn the material they need to know while at the same time staying in an environment where the student is comfortable in and not having to deal with peers who make the student feel uncomfortable. 
3537	However, some may argue that some students will abuse this system so they could stay home because they wish to skip class and be lazy or maybe just want to stay home. 
3538	While this may be true, not all students are like this, and if they abuse the system it will ultimately harm them. 
3539	They will not learn the material they need and therefore won't succeed in the future when they need the information regarding the material the most. Furthermore, schools should have the option of attending classes through online means because the student may be sick. It is common for students to get sick once a while and therefore cannot come to school and must stay home to avoid the risk of getting others sick with things like the flu. So, if their school had the option to attend a class using an online resource, the student could be at home recovering while still learning the material they need.  
3540	""" The electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recevies a majority of the votes cast. "
3541	The reason why we need to start now is because it isn't fair for a group of electors to vote for the president, when the votes of the people are pretty much worthless. 
3542	When were voting for president were not technically voting for the presient in fact we are voting for the slate of electors. The electors can be anyone without a public holding office. Electoral college process is not a good processs for presidency. While a president can get the majority of the popular vote; on the other hand, he could have the minority of the electoral college votes. That president would lose the elecetion even though he technicallly had the most votes. 
3543	We should change the process into popular votes for the president.  
3544	The electoral college can or will defy the will of the people. 
3545	"The article ""The indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong' ,by Bradford Plumer it quoted ,Back in 1960,segregationists in the Louisana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose Jhon F. Kennedy.(So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy).The election whould have gone the other way if the due to the electoral college. The electoral college are way too risky to take on. just simply couple of unwilling electors can change the tide of the election. "
3546	"In the article called What Is The Electoral College"", by the office of the Federeal register it quoted most states have a winner-take-all system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate. In the other article  ""The indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong' ,by Bradford Plumer it quoted , candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the swing states. Electoral  college is a unfair process because of the winner take it all. The winner takes it all system is a unfair process for the American citizens. even with a slightly change in the electoral college could change the tide or even cause a tie in the election.  "
3547	In conclusion,The electoral college is a unfair process that has cause presidential election to change. The best results for electing president is by the popular vote. Obviously popular votes sounds more efficient and a clean election. The winner-takes it all process counterfits the number of american citizens voting result. Eletoral college process is an extra step to the election with more problems than barely any benefits. Electoral  college should be change and alter in to a different process with clean votes that'll actually be fair for once.    
3548	I believe that community service should be a completely voluntary thing. But i do think that you should initiate a school wide punishment for those caught littering on campus. 
3549	"This might be the hundreth letter opened about this electoral college topic, but this is a very important subject that needs to be run by all of our citizens. Honestly the electoral college is very important because of the fact that after elections after everyone has voted they are the ones that are the electors for the President and the Vice President. Its not like it was made for no reason it was made to make the elections fair, it's not like it's the first time people have wanted to get abolish the Electoral College even many people have wanted to remove this like for example Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, and more but this dosnt mean that it is the right choice. Yes it is agreed that there are some downs to have the Electoral College, plus even the person that the Electoral College votes fo that might not be the person most of the nation choose. Like now in the 2012 elections Obama had more Electoral votes than Romney""Because almost all states award the electorsl votes on a winner-takes all basis."" "
3550	There is a vast number of improvements that still need to be made in order for these cars to function properly. 
3551	Driverless cars have too much technology involved that could easily malfunction and lead to several mishaps. 
3552	"Looking at paragraph 4 it states that,""Google's modified Toyota Prius uses position-estimating sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a video camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automative radar sensors, a GPS receiver, and an inertial motion sensor."" From this quote, you can already see how complex a driverless car needs to be in order to run efficiently. All of these gadgets have to installed and all of them are very necessary. According to the author in paragraph 4, it also claims, ""The most important bit of technology in this system is the spinning sensor on the roof. Dubbed LIDAR, it uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings."" If the LIDAR malfunctions, then the car has no information on its surroundings. It would be virtually impossible for a driverless car to work without the perfect execution of all these devices. I believe that there is too much room for error. "
3553	I also am against driverless cars because there is a lack of safety when a driver is not in control of a car. 
3554	"Many states agree with this and do not allow for driverless cars to occupy their roads. In paragraph 9 it explains how,""Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. As a result, in most states it is illegal to even test computer-driven cars."" This quote tells you that the traffic laws of numerous states would need to be altered for driverless cars to be allowed. The majority of states believe that they are not safe and restrict their use. Traffic laws as well as liability laws would need to be redone in order to cover the safety. At the end of paragraph 9 it asks,""If technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver of the manufacturer?"" This directly correlates to a lack of safety and major complications. In case of an accident, the victim would not know who to blame and in the end would severely suffer. There are way too much obstacles that obstruct the safety of too many citizens with driverless cars. "
3555	driverless cars are not fully capable of running independently. 
3556	In my opinion, driverless cars do not need to be developed. The science and technology involved is susceptible to malfunction and could result in many problems. There is a lack of safety when it comes to these cars and various states agree. Also, a driver could be clueless and not listen to the alerts given be the car when it was trying to gain their attention. This could lead to an accident or something even worse. For these reasons, I oppose the development of driverless cars. 
3557	imagine if you don't help the earth probably sometime in the future , you wont be in a world full of sunshine and happiness, but you will be living in a world of darkness and despair. 
3558	Helping out at a retirement home is a good way of showing your community support and that you care about all the people in your community 
3559	having the transportation to get to where you need to go in order to be able to help out can be a problem. 
3560	Many of the kids in the school that will be participating in this event cannot drive on their own, they are brought to and from places by their parents. As willingly as this students maybe about helping out, their parents/guardian may not have the time to take them where they need to go. Parents are very busy, not only with their kids, but with work, and adding another thing for them to worry about might not be good. This could also get in the way of their schedule 
3561	Growing up helping people with small acts of kindness as simple as getting an elder person a glass of water, helping someone put in groceries, helping out serve food at a homeless shelter will make you a better person inside and out. By helping out others around you with small things can bring big rewards later on.  
3562	I think that the idea of having everyone participate in community service is great. Some kids might have difficulties with transportation but minor problems like that can be solved as simply as car pooling with a neighbor or friend, riding a bike which is even better because it helps out the environment, or even walking. And, all these small things that you might have to sacrifice for it, like watching a movie with your friends will be worth it in the end. 
3563	at the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters.  
3564	If I had a choice between keeping the Electoral College or a popular Vote, I would pick a popular vote cause the Electoral College is pretty crashed and it really fair. I say give people a chance and let them vote.  Picking a pedigree plurality of votes from the Electoral College then from the Popular votes isnt fair based on us. No voters vote swings a national election,and in spite of that,about one-half the eligible American population did vote in the election of 2012,as said in pharagraph 23. I think that Voting for the popular vote would be better then Electoral College cause it would be the states vote instead of just a majority of peoples vote that only want a president that is not validated for success for us. 
3565	I think that students should have the choice to do community service 
3566	I think the only time a student should be forced to do community service is when their being punished. 
3567	Most students might have too much to do for community service 
3568	If there too busy doing community service the students might not be able to take care of there more important responsibilities. Students might have homework or house chores to do.  
3569	If they're always doing community service, when will the students be able to have time to enjoy for themselves. Doing community service takes a lot of time out of a persons day. If there was a test a student had to take the next day after doing community service when schools over and if that student spent a lot of time to do that, then when that student got home, he would be restless and probably wouldn't have enough time to study for that test. I just don't think that community service is healthy for a lot of kids learning environments 
3570	Helping out seniors in homes is a great way to help others that after so long of hard working now need a way to know they did a great job in their life and that they're being appreciate. Doing some garden help might be a big mess but it's a great way to help the community out, even at a school. Another good way of helping a student is to have them help those in need, which helps them be thankful for what they have and to not give up on their goals. I am not only saying this for the good of others, I am also saying this with experience, not only from myself but other friends of mines that have changed from the help of doing community service for their school or for another requirement. 
3571	I believe that community service should be required because no doubt that every teacher wants a self-controlled person in their class, I am not saying that every person will be made to be caring or controlled, but they will know that doing those things do pay off when you look back and think at them. Some studies have also showed that helping out does build a self-made person with respect for themselves and others. This will also make the school look good with all the students who do help to create the community better. 
3572	The world needs our help, and would do greatly with the support. Community service is a great way to keep the world and people healthy and happy. I personally think that community services are a great way to get everyone together to do positive things that can make a great benefit towards everything and everyone. 
3573	There are many community service projects that we could start doing. 
3574	We could clean the communities from all the trash and glass on the earth, we could volunteer at homeless shelters and nursing homes, we could paint houses and help civilians with simple tasks like walking their dogs, raking their leaves, mowing their lawns, simple little things like that. 
3575	Of coarse we're going to need help persuading people to do these little things. 
3576	We could inform them about the benefits of having a healthy world and about the things that are happening right now because of the careless acts of others. Telling people about these things will help them get an understanding of how bad things are right now and to do simple, but hard-working things can cause a great change to the world. 
3577	I understand that some people think that community service is a waste of time. 
3578	We need to help them understand that the only way things are going to change are by the acts of others. 
3579	We wouldn't have a lot of things if it weren't for the kind act of other people. For example, what people are doing in Haiti is a kind act of helping. The water wells that are being built there are helping the Haitians so they can have clean drinking water and cleaning water. I am sure that the Haitians are very thankful that there are people in the world that care. 
3580	This means that our votes don't really count for much. It also means that even though we voted for someone the slate could have voted for someone completely different. Also we the people have no idea who the electors are. Who even picks them? The electors that are chosen depends on the state, sometimes it's the state conventions, sometimes the states party's central committee, and sometimes it can be the presidential canidate himself. Some voters didnt even see campaigne ads, so how did they chose their presidential caidate? They didn't, the Electoral College did. 
3581	Most people prefer elections to be based on popular vote so they know they get what they want, so they know they're actually making an impact. 
3582	The electoral college is one of the most heavily criticized institutions in the American government system. It has been considered outdated and anti-democratic. 
3583	However, without it, the balance of power in America would be skewed to an unacceptable degree. States with large populations would be disproportionately empowered, without the electoral college. This leaves the smaller states' existence to be controlled by the larger states, to the dismay of the American economy and people. 
3584	As it stands, most states vote in a way that presents a united front of electors to the electoral college. 
3585	If just over half of the Californian voters vote for one candidate that they think would represent their interests, the map in source 3 shows that all 55 electors will present their votes to the college. It is better for California to be represented in this way so that the Californian economy would not be adversely effected by their minority voters. That sort of united front is beneficial to every state in the union, for the same reason. 
3586	Dissolving the electoral college would make swing states irrelevant to presidential elections, as it'd be impossible to win votes in those states by any decent margin. Instead, campaigns would focus on the areas in which they already have an agreeable population, as to encourage them to vote, and get the most voters possible, using their resources. Trying to win states, rather than population, allows for voters to be more informed. 
3587	The electoral college might not be the best potential method for presidential elections. It is, however, far more desirable for such a large country than popular vote. Popular vote would lead to neglecting many areas of the economy that are important, but do not have a presence in states with large populations. It would make elections more one sided for each state at the same time. The problems the opponents say abolishing it would fix, would be fixed without it, but doing so would create far more problems than it solved. It is also easy enough to fix the same problems without abolishing the electoral college. 
3588	"The first reason is Certainty of Outcome. This means ""it's less likley than a dispute over the popular vote."" Which really means the candidates share to the other people in the Electoral college there share of the popular vote and thats how they vote. The second reason is Everyone's President. This is basically shows that ""the Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal."" This means that no region such as south,northwest,etc. has enough electoral votes to elect a president. The third resone to keeping these methods is Swing States. This tells me that its the ""winner takes all method."" The fourth method why we should keep these methods is the Big States. This explains that ""the Electoral College restores some of the wieght in the political balance."" this means that the bigger states get a big advantage in the electoral because the people that get elected into office there is based off of population so they have an advantage. THe bigger states get more attention from the candates then the smaller states do. The final reason why we should keep this method of voting is Avoid Run-Off Elections. This means ""the Electoral College aviods the problem of Elections in which no candidates recieves a majority of the votes cast"". This means no pressure for candidates when they win majority of the votes cast. "
3589	Direct voting would be a better way to vote so that everybody felt like their votes really counted towards who they voted for and that they arent getting cheated because one president has more electors supporting them. The electoral college is not based on equality because everybodys votes count differently due to supporters or electors who are pretty much the ones getting the votes. fixing the way people vote and how they vote can change the way some people feel towards the preident no matter who they are. Let the people vote for who they want and not the electors because it would make more people more open to vote than there are now.      
3590	Sports and other after school activities take a lot of time and commitment, and leave participants with much less time to study. 
3591	Also, a B average is a 3.0 GPA, which is nearly honor roll! 
3592	Every student has his or her talents. 
3593	Some excel at schoolwork, but others are outstanding in other fields, such as basketball, volleyball, or singing. Forcing students to keep their grades at such a high standard would cause late nights for many participants, who struggle to finish their homework daily. It means extra hours of studying and homework. It can be especially stressful on students high-level courses, such as Honors English and Social Studies or geometry. These students work hard enough in such classes and their efforts should be applauded, not looked down upon. 
3594	A C average, while maybe not something to post on your fridge at home, still requires plenty of effort. Maintaining a C average is a reasonable standard, but keeping a B average is unattainable for some students and should not be required. 
3595	"""It's hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college"" (Plumer, Paragraph 14)! The voters think the Electoral College is unfair and outdated. People vote for a candidate but the outcome is not what they were expecting. The candidates that get the most popular votes deserve to win! "
3596	Community service can be a big way to help others. You usually need to do community service when you are either getting your confirmation done, or if you are in an honor society. Some people like to do community service for the joy of it though.  
3597	In my opinion, all students should perform community service. 
3598	Helping the community can make you feel good about yourself 
3599	and it is also very helpful to the environment around you. 
3600	It does take time away from you, 
3601	but that time is used to help others 
3602	If you just stay home all day on the computer or watching television, community service would be something to take your mind off of doing that. Or also, if you are constantly bored, community service cold even be a way of entertainment for yourself. Community service is a way to get out of your laziness and do something.  
3603	There are a lot of people out there who need help with your community service. 
3604	Some children for example need tutoring in certain subjects that you may be able to help with. Another example is cleaning up litter in your local park or just on the streets outside your house. Elderly people can get lonely sometimes and a great way of community service would be to write them letters for the holidays and bring them happiness. If you are interested in arts and crafts you can get together with friends and make artwork for sick children in hospitals. Other people love snow. If you're one of those people who love the snow, you can shovel your neighbors driveways next time it snows. The thing is that if they offer you money, you cannot accept it, you must kindly say no or then it would not be community service. 
3605	some students have a c grade average and are on many of the sports hear at school some work very hard for that c because school is guest to hard for them. i bet if it was there choice they would have a A or a B. But not everyone has the same brain so school will be difficult for some student than others. 
3606	But me personally if i was the principal i would let any chilod play with a C or higher average because god made us all different and were not all as smart as our classmates. 
3607	I believe that it is only fair to keep the Electoral College. 
3608	If there was no Electoral College people with no actual idea of whats going on would vote, and that could have a negative affect. 
3609	if there was no Electoral College there would be an unfair amount of votes in larger states. 
3610	Swing States, which is also a very important part of the voting process. 
3611	Without Electoral voters, there would be indecisive people voting for a candidate they know nothing about. 
3612	For example, many young voters base their votes off of popular opinion, not what they think is actually right. If there was no Electoral College, the Nation could be in a lot of trouble because many votes would be casted off of popular opinion. So it is good to have some control over what happens and who becomes president, but I think having the full decision to vote for whomever, and have it count, is overdoing it. 
3613	Secondly, I believe that having the Electoral College is great because, without it larger states would have more of a say on who becomes president. 
3614	"This would be very unfair to the smaller states for an obvious reason, population. Even though a few states might have a bigger population that doesn't particularly mean that everyone in the state will vote. There are still ""independent voters"". For example, as stated in paragraph twenty-one, the election voting in Florida was very close and relied a lot on popular votes. Florida ended up getting twenty-nine electoral votes, compared to Wyoming who only got three electoral votes. State size does matter because larger states will typically always get more attention from the presidential candidates than smalller ones. "
3615	Lastly, The Electoral College is a very important part of our voting process becaue of Swing States 
3616	"As stated in paragraph twenty, voters in toss-up states are ""more likely to listen to the campaign and the competing candidates"". These voters know that their votes wont make much of an impression on the election, but pay the most attention anyways. "
3617	People claim that the most involved voters should be able to decide the elections. 
3618	To conclude my previously stated reasons, I believe that having the Electoral College is a crucial part of the system. Because without it the nation would have so many voters that only cast their votes based off of popular opinion. Also without it larger states would have more of an affect on the votes than the smaller states do. Finally, Swing States are a very important part of voting because voters who know what is going on and actually pay attention do have one of the biggest affects.    
3619	"Technology has improved immensely just in the last sixteen years. According to the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"", before 2000, a rover was "" device on a hilltop that cost two hundred million dollars"". Now, humans are trying to create cars that does not need a driver. Though technology has gone far, it has not gone far enough to accomplish such a feat. "
3620	Though there are numerous sensors surrounding the car and the driver is notified when they need to take control, there still isnt enough for a car to work on its own. Even if the car reached the technological point to ensure the safety of the passengers, another large safety concern would be other drivers on the road. Yes, the driverless car can sense when it is about to ensue a collision, it does not have the capability to avoid it, just lik any other car. So, as a human, I would rather trust myself for my safety over technology. 
3621	When it comes to the law, texting and drinking while driving is illegal. If driverless cars were created and used, humans would be breaking two laws that harm drivers the most. Yes, the driver will be notified when they are in need by lights and a vibrating seat, but if they are under the influence they will not be able to anyways. If they are distracted in any way by texting, food, etc. then they will not be in a ready situation to take control of the vehicle. AS a driver, it would be nice to sleep and the driverless car would allow that, but that would be just as dangerous as sleeping behind the wheel in a regular car. The driver would not be ready to take the wheel or they would not even notice when they are in need to take the wheel. 
3622	Creating a heads up display would add to this distraction and would take on the role of texting and driving. 
3623	"With the positives, though, it is not enough for the driverless car to save someone's life. It does not have the technology to avoid other drivers. And, driverless cars will never cancel the use of regular cars because not everyone will trust them. Driverless cars will create controversy, just as the passage brought up ""Whose fault is it in an accident? The cars or the drivers?"" "
3624	Though driverless cars have come a long way and have very good ideas, they need much more work before they can be trustable.      
3625	the person who has the popular vote may not win presidency, 
3626	"the ""winner take all"" system causes voters in certain states to not feel like they are creating an impact "
3627	In our voting system even if a candidate receives more votes than their opponents he or she still could lose the election because of the electoral college 
3628	"Here is a prime example, in the 2000 election Al Gore won the popular vote but because he had less electoral votes than Bush he unfourtunetly lost the election. According to Bradford Plumer ""over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" It seems rather logical that if somebody gains the most votes in an election that the country would prefer that canidate to be the president. For that reason alone the reader should side with the idea to abolish the electoral college. Now besides somebody receiving more or less electoral votes, perhaps the candidates tied. In this case it gets thrown to the House Of Representitives which will cause a Wyoming Rep. with 500,000 voters to have just as much say as a California Rep. with 35,000,000 voters. All a tie would do is corrupt the voting system even more than it is. For those reasons there should be an indefinite ban on the electoral college. "
3629	Additionally the winner take all method in some states makes voters feel unimportant. 
3630	"Some may argue that no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president but regions do have the power to swing an election in an enourmous way. An effect of the winner take all system is candidates not going to certain states if they know they can not win it. This can basically stop some voters from wasting time and voting because they may feel there personal vote would make no difference. In the 2000 election ""17 states did not see candidates at all."" according to Bradford Plumer. How could somebody possibly feel engaged in an election if whoever is running finds there vote unimportantant to them winning the election. "
3631	America's government was inspired by the Athenian republic, therefore giving the United States  their way of governing today. In a republic government, it is said that the people of the country hold the power of electing their leaders to make decisions for their nation. In the United States of America, the presidential election is held every four years. The eligible citizens in every fifty states are granted the right to vote for their desired president. The process of which these votes are counted is called the Electoral College. 
3632	The way in which a president is selected should be altered to the most popular vote because it produces a more accurate vote of the people and it provides the opportunity to directly select an individual's desired candidate. 
3633	Initially, the process of which the president of the United States is elected should be changed from the Electoral College to the most popular vote because it will produce a more accurate percentage of votes. 
3634	"In the article, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,"" Bradford Plumer states, ""And if an electoral tie seems unlikely, consider this: In 1968, a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election; In 1976, a tie would have occured is a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way."" Being that there is a lesser number of votes counted in an election due to the Electoral College, there is a highly greater chance of the outcome resulting in a tie rather than showing a clear winner. If the election was based off of the most popular vote, there would be a higher number of votes for each candidate, therefore reducing the chances of ending in a tie. Secondly, in the article, ""What is the Electoral College?"" the Office of the Federal Register wrote, ""The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral vote is required to elect the President."" This statement shows that the Electoral College requires more than just the majority of citizen's opinions. If  at least half of the population votes one way, there should be no question about who is the winner. The most popular vote system would award the candidate that was favored by at least half of the population, therefore providing a clear and fair election. Clearly, the most popular vote sysytem would significantly benefit the American Society. "
3635	Aditionally, the process in which the President is elected should be changed to the most popular vote because it will provide the opportunity to directly select and individual's desired candidate. 
3636	"In the article, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why event the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,"" Bradford Plumer quotes, ""Under the electoral college sytem, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" This is not how a republic is supposed to run. People are supposed to be granted the opportunity to elect the president of their choice, not of somebody elses. The most popular vote would take into consideration of every citizen's opinion with a direct percentage of votes to elect a certain candidate. In the article, ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President,"" Richard A. Posner states, ""The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. No region (South, Northeast, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president."" This may be true but if the most popular vote system was put into place, there would be an even more exact number of how many people voted for each candidate. The Electoral College does not voice the opinions of all citizens because in reality, a person is not directly voting for their desired candidate. They are voting for other representatives that will hopefully, in turn, elect the candidate they want. Obviously, the Electoral College is definitely a system that should be abolished in the United States of America. "
3637	In summation, the way in which a president is selected should be altered to the most popular vote because it produces a more accurate vote of the people and it provides the opportunity to directly select an individual's desired candidate. The Electoral College does not provide a fair result nor a clear winner. The most popular vote system would significantly change that for the better of the country 
3638	In our modern era, the reality that American public schools have yet failed to implement online learning programs nationally comes across as a damning testament to the slovenliness and archaism of educational bureaucracy. 
3639	I believe that allowing students to attend their classes from home would benefit students, educators, and administrators as a whole 
3640	the efficiency passively attributed to being able to learn from the comfort of one's own home. 
3641	The idea of implementing online learning programs on a national level to isolate students and staff from contagious illness and disease perhaps sounds bombastic and reactionary at a first glance, 
3642	but many of the greatest epidemics of the twenty-first century have been due to the proliferation of disease by child and adolescent carriers. 
3643	For example, the recent pandemic-level outbreak of the novel coronavirus in America has led to the closure of all public schools in Seattle, Washington. By ensuring that children and adolescents can obtain a proper education online and from the comfort of their home environment, fewer people as a whole get sick and fewer carriers can actively spread a given malady. In addition to the aforementioned benefits of online public education, accessibility to immunocompromised and/or older teachers & immunocompromised students opens up significantly and such individuals can obtain a quality education with mitigated risk. 
3644	The second main benefit of attending classes from home is the simple fact that it is, by and large, more comfortable for most people to learn from their homes than it is in another less familiar environment. 
3645	Better focus, however, does not solely stem from a comfortable learning environment, 
3646	but is rather amplified by the lack of distractions from events in a regular classroom or other students, allowing for an equal distribution and ratio of teacher attention to student performance rather than behavior or minimizing distraction. Grades will go up, costs will go down, and teachers and students can mutually gain from one another. 
3647	The slow lurch of schools nationwide toward progress must be substituted and replaced by an accelerating stride toward the future of education and the inevitable ubiquity of online learning to better suit the needs of the students of the current and next generations and to give rise to healthier, cheaper, and more productive learning environments that all people should benefit from.  
3648	 Community service is the gift that keeps on giving, without it I truly believe without what purpose does man-kind have. I want to take this special opportunity to ask you may we do community service? It would be a great learning experience to the kids. If we do this surely the kids that believe helping is wrong will change their minds. 
3649	Everyday, in the world people are corrupted by the following: losing their jobs, a natural disaster may put them out of their homes, and even just a problem with finances. When some of those people lost everything, they literally lost ever thing except for maybe the clothes on their back and the pride that may have been shattered 
3650	When kids don't understand now of the possibilities of their future they are at higher risk of them becoming one of those people. This is the main reason why we should help in our community to make it a better place for the follow up generation. 
3651	There are lots of things we could do to participate in the community, America, and maybe the whole entire world, baby steps! 
3652	"As middle school children we could have a donation fund at the front office, asking for just a dollar, and if they don't have a dollar, pennies are good to. Then after, we could take it and donate to any shelter that needs it the most. Another idea is, we could just spend an hour a day making our planet clean by helping pick up trash, plant flowers and trees, etc. There are many different projects that we can take on, all together SCHOOL_NAME would truly stand as ""The Best Middle School In The World."" "
3653	All students should be required to perform community service. 
3654	As the human race we must stand together united. If not help the homeless help the community littering problem. If not help the problem help the younger children. If we help the younger kids they may go on in life understanding to help you neighbor. 
3655	The Election System should be changed to popular vote. The Electoral College is unfair and irratinol. It should be cancelled, and be based upon popular vote with numbers that make since. 
3656	The voters are left with an unfair outcome at almost every election because of the Electoral Collage. The votes can either be very close or the people could miss Ads or campaigns for canidates, leaving the people with nothing and confusion all over. Even if you knew what elector you voted for, you cant necessarily pick who it is your voting for and your vote could possibly get confued giving you a bad outcome. Most elections are just slid by and are just based on what ever the Electoral College thinks should happen. So please abolish the Electoral College its is irrational and is not neccessary, let the people really have a fair chance. 
3657	It looked like an Egyptian pharoah, but turned out to be a regular, old mesa. It is still debated whether it was created by ancient Martian life, or whether is was just another regular landform on Mars. 
3658	My fellow co-workers and I thought this was incredible. We had just found something that could have proven ancient life on Mars. It turned out that it wasn't. Later, we figured out that it was another regular Martian mesa 
3659	In conclusion, the face is just a natural landform. It may look like a head, but that is just because of the unusual shadows that the mesa has. If my co-workers and I thought this was actually proof of alien life, why would we hide it from you? What is the point in hiding that kind of information? 
3660	Therefore Electoral College should be kept instead of Popular vote, because it is time consuming, it is good for big states, and it is less likely of a dispute. Even though this method is not liked by all it is the smartest and most efficient.   
3661	As of now we use the Electoral Colllege method, but looking back through previous years there is evidence this method has caused some dispute. Due to these problems I suggest using the popular voting method. 
3662	The popular voting method is not only a direct vote for the desired candidate of the people's choice 
3663	this method is also less complicated, leaving less room for many problems. 
3664	but over recent study some people are beginning to become more fond of the popular voting method. 
3665	"The popular voting method is directly controlled by the people and their vote is sent directly to their desired candidate. On the other side, by using the electoral college method voters vote for a select member of the state's electoral college votes and that member is  elgible to vote for any presidential candidate of their choice. According to the article ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five Reasons to keep our Despised Method of Choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner, "" when you vote for a presidential candidate you are actually voting for a slate of electors."" Further evidence from this article (quote on quote) claims there is a "" lack of democratic pedigree."" Electoral voting also only benefits the larger states because of there is a  larger amount of members of the electoral college for the  larger states. "
3666	Popular voting provides a more direct way for votes from the people to reach their desired candidate as opposed to someone who may not vote for a candidate of their choice. 
3667	In addition to many down sides of the electoral college voting method, there have been incidents in the past while using this method of voting. 
3668	"For example, evidence in the article "" The Indefensible Electoral College: why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer, in 1960  there was an indicident pertaining to the election of John F. Kennedy. In his case, segregationists from Louisiana were planning to (and just about succeeded) in replacing the Democratic electors with electors to whom opposed JFK.  This article also brings up another problem with the elctoral college votes in the year of 2000 listing it as the ""2000 fiasco"" and ""biggest crisis of the century."" "
3669	"In conclusion, the popular voting method should be applied as the designated process of electing the United States President because it guarantees a direct vote towards a desired candidate of your choice. As our country is listed as a democracy, the votes towards the President should lie in the hands of the people. The electoral college is prone to many more problems and is a more complex method of voting. With votes in the hands of the people, voters can get a full "" hands on"" voting experience. As to not repeat myself, in this way voters can really understand the voting system and get the idea in their head their vote is going towards their chosen candidate. Popular voting has not only been proven to be the more preferred method of voting, but in my opinion, shall be the established method of voting to use in the future elections.   "
3670	Community service: an assignment that many students detest. Many say that it's too time consuming, that they have better things to do. Others just don't see the point of providing a service to their community. Whichever side you're on, it all comes down to one question: Should students be required to perform community service? 
3671	"As a young mind in a world diverse opinions and perspectives, I have seen that the generation I live in has become a ""me"" generation. In other words, this generation of students has become so selfish and absorbed in their own personal needs, they've forgotten that there are other people in this world who have greater issues that they must face. For example, when students are requested to give money for a charitable cause, such as helping the less fortunate in third world countries, they choose not to. The sad part is that this refusal to help others in need is not because they are uninformed, but because they are so caught in themselves that they are too selfish to even provide for someone other than themselves. As a matter of fact, 87% of students in middle school stated that if they ever had the chance to give back to their community in a simple way, they would not. "
3672	The point I'm trying to make is that requiring community service of students will push them to lay down their pride and conceit to assist someone else. 
3673	"To reiterate, students should be required to perform a community service because it will give them a chance to put their ""self love"" on low by helping others. The way I see it, students are on one side of the fence, and because they've never left that one side, they have been led to believe that it is all sunshine and rainbows. However, by requiring of them to take the fence down, they will realize that the grass is much greener in the other side. Don't you want to lead your students to greener grasses? "
3674	I have read and heard your argument about all students taking place in community service by mandatory rule. No disrespect to you sir, but I have to firmly disagree with this idea. 
3675	If students should take place in community service, they should do it on their own terms on their own time. 
3676	What is community service without the positive attitude to help somebody out? Instead of having this positive attitude in your students, what you'll receive is a bunch of poor attitudes and the bare minimum of effort. 
3677	I have experienced community service before as I have fed the homeless a few times. Trust me, I'm no angel but I did enjoy what I was doing for others. My brother on the other hand, was lazy, disrespectful, and gave the absolute minimum effort needed to pass by. That does not sound like community service to me. 
3678	Honestly, the first thing that pops into my head when I think of community service is a bunch of people on the side on the highway with glowing yellow vests picking up trash. 
3679	Community service? Try a punishment. And that is exactly what these kids will feel like they're being if you demand that they take place in the community. 
3680	A large group of students would volunteer to get involved in community service, not all, but a good 30 or 40 kids. From a teen to an adult, students never like being forced into something they do not want to do. They hate having parents or teachers breathing down their backs telling them to do things. When you ease off the reins and give us some breathing room, there will be greater participation and overall success in what you're trying to accomplish in this case. 
3681	The kids who have brothers and sisters to take care of at home, practice for a sport, or just want to have a good time with their friends do not have time half the days in the week to do this 
3682	If you give them the time to make their own schedule or re arrange days to hang out with friends, you may see a better majority of kids who wish to help out in their community by giving back in the form of community service. 
3683	The worst thing that can go wrong for you by giving them the option is that maybe just 10 kids take place in what you want them to do 
3684	And then all you have to do from there is just sit down and talk with them during an assembly or whatever just to get them motivated. 
3685	If for some reason you do decide to pass this rule that all kids MUST participate, I guarantee you that it will make for a less happy, functional school in the long run 
3686	Some examples of community service activities that i would encourage you to suggest to the students are, cleaning trash around the school, planting new trees and plants in the park to help the environment, helping at many school sponsored events, and helping in the local soup kitchens around the community. These are some of the easier things that i recommend that you suggest the students to attend. 
3687	Technology has become almost fully integrated into today's society. Computers, smart phones, and more are used in a positive aspect; the driverless car is no exception. 
3688	The development of driverless cars is a positive and necessary one, one that will help improve society significantly. 
3689	One of the most important features of driving is safety, and the driverless car has been safe. 
3690	"Google's cars that can drive independently under specific conditions have ""driven more than half a million miles without a crash."" The driverless car has not been fully developed, yet already Google's cars have successfully driven over a long distance without any accidents. Technology is constantly improving, and so will safety. Google's cars have position-estimating sensors, automative radar sensors, and even a rotation sensor on the roof. As these senors are improving, it is also making ""driving safer and also leading to cars that can handle more and more driving tasks on their own."" Once the driverless car is completed, it should have the sensors and technology to keep drivers safe, more than the ability of an actual human drivers to keep themselves safe. The advanced technology is not only a dream, but is slowly becoming a reality. Sebastian Thrun, founder of the Google Car project, ""believes that the technology has finally begun to catch up to the dream."" The driverless car is a ensured success, and with the development of the driverless car, comes the ensured safety of the driver. "
3691	Not only would the driverless car be safe, but it would also be efficient. 
3692	Lastly, the driverless car would be able to provide safety as well as entertainment. 
3693	"Currently, cell phones and almost everything is a distraction and hazard to the human driver. But with the driverless car, the driver is able to maintain his own safety and entertain himself. Some manufactures are going to bring ""in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays. Such displays can be turned off instantly when the drivers need to take over."" The driver can now safely entertan himself and know he will be safe. The technology is able to instantly alert the driver, keeping him from coming into harm's way. The driver has luxury, comfort, and safety with the development of the driverless car, something not available to the current driver.  "
3694	 The driverless car has too many positives, and should most certainly be developed. The development of the car would bring about greater safety, efficiency, and entertainment to every driver. The potential of technology is limitless, and the driverless car should be used to further enhance and accomodate the experience of every driver around the globe.      
3695	We should keep the Electoral College for the voting of the United States. 
3696	One good reason is they know for sure who is going to the president of the United States because of the way the Electoral College is. 
3697	Avoiding Run-Off Elections is one good reason why we should keep the Electoral College 
3698	"That is in the second paragraph and it really gets my attention, ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for the slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" With this in mind it is telling us the people that we are not voting for the president at all that is what most people believe that they are doing so you are kind of lying to some of them. "
3699	Have you ever woken up in the morning and wished you could just stay in bed? Many students probably experience this on a daily basis. Luckily, with the advent of computers and the internet, you may not need to leave bed to go to school at all. Many schools already use computers to allow students to work on and turn in assignments online. However, some schools now allow their students to attend their classes online as well. The benefits of this option are significant and numerous. 
3700	they could attend classes under conditions that would normally prevent them from doing so, 
3701	Firstly, the option of online classes would allow students to attend classes despite conditions that would normally prevent them from doing so. 
3702	For example, during winter, schools across the nation often close because of hazardous weather conditions that make it too dangerous to travel to school. However, with online classes, students could simply be instructed online, avoiding many missed days of valuable learning. This system would also take pressure off of school systems to keep schools open on days with questionably dangerous weather. Without worrying about missing yet another day of classes, schools could make the safe choice and close on more of these days. Additionally, it is common for students to stay home a few days when sick so that they can recover and avoid infecting their classmates. However, it is often the case that despite the risk of infecting classmates, students are still well enough to participate in class, but are unable to do so. With the option of online classes, these students could still participate without risking infection. A present day example of the possible utility of online classes is the Coronavirus outbreak. Many school systems worldwide have already shut down as a result of the virus. With online classes, these school systems could continue to instruct their students while also decreasing the risk of Coronavirus spreading. Overall, there are many situations in which online classes allow instruction to continue when not normally possible through traditional methods. 
3703	In general, home is more comfortable than school for many kids. The ready access to food and a bathroom, as well as an environment that one is familiar with, means that many students would be more relaxed learning from home. With a lower stress level, students would likely be more productive and engaged in their classes. Additionally, some students can get stressed out over the classroom environment. Personally, I know that I have felt anxious in situations when I didn't know the answer to a question I was asked or when I had to read aloud. For me, and for many other students, attending classes from home would help to alleviate some of that stress and anxiety. 
3704	However, students already have to focus at home for homework. By having kids focus on a class at home, it would actually help reinforce their ability to focus and be disciplined in an environment in which they could be easily distracted, which is a useful life skill. Overall, in the more relaxed environment of home, students could be much more productive and successful in their classes than if they attended in person. 
3705	Firstly, there is no travel time from home to the school. Additionally, transition time in between classes and time for lunch could be saved as well. This saved time could be put to various good uses. Classes could be lengthened, or another class could be added to students' schedules. Students could also get more sleep in the morning; many teenagers are chronically sleep deprived, so this would be a massive benefit. Students could also use the extra time to get a job. 
3706	One argument against online classes is that they would stop kids from learning to interact in person. 
3707	However, the time saved through online classes would actually allow students to spend more time out with friends, which would teach them to get along with other people well. 
3708	Another benefit is that students could attend distant schools that would not be practical to attend in person. Besides the saved travel time, switching to more online classes would eliminate a great deal of paper waste, as many more assignments and materials would probably be online. This would benefit the environment, and it would keep students from having to keep track of both physical and digital assignments and documents. Finally, school systems could save money on a great deal of physical infrastructure, such as school buildings, classroom materials, and buses. The funds saved could be redirected towards giving students computers, paying teachers more, or investing in better learning resources. Overall, the saved time and money from switching to more online classes would significantly benefit students and teachers. 
3709	As technology advances, the classroom should advance as well. By embracing the opportunities created by technology, students can learn in ways never before possible and receive a higher quality education. Through more efficient use of time made possible by technology, students can spend more time having fun or earning money while still learning just as much. The online learning environment can make it easier for some students to get engaged in classes. The money saved because of online classes can be reallocated to improving students' education. These great benefits, among many others, demonstrate why online classes should be an option for every student. 
3710	 Community service should not be required by all students. Although community service is a wonderful thing, service should never be forced 
3711	I think it shouldn't be required because when students are required to do something they usually don't want to do it 
3712	When you are serving others you are doing it to be kind, but if you had no option then you're doing it for no reason. People are always grateful when others serve them but most of the time they aren't as thankful if they know that serving them wasn't the persons option, and had they been given a choice they probably wouldn't have done it. 
3713	It's a rebellious stage of life when they think they can do whatever pleases them. So naturally if someone tells them that they absolutely must do something, they automatically think no way. If they have an attitude like this it will ruin the experience and they won't get the good feeling people do when you serve others. They might dislike it so much that they don't even do service when they're grown up. They resent people that tell them they have to do something, and then they are ornery towards everyone else afterwards. 
3714	If they had lots of little siblings and both their parents were at work all day, then they would have to watch them and they would never find time to do things such as community service. Also someone that doesn't excel in school but wanted to get a scholarship would probably have to be working very hard almost all day to get good enough grades. And if someone knew they had no chance at getting a scholarship, but still wanted to go to college would have to be working hard in school and they would need a job so they would be able to pay for all the expenses of college. Another example would be someone that isn't good in school but is very talented in sports. They would want to be doing their sport so that they could be good enough to get an athletic scholarship. 
3715	Therefore community service should be recommended to students, not required because when people serve they should do it willingly, and if they don't they won't have a good attitude about it. Teenagers have a mind of their own so being told what to do bothers them to the point of them never doing it again, and some peoples life may be full of various activities already so they simply don't have the time for it. 
3716	I think we should keep the Electoral College because it gives the people opportunities to vote for electors and presidents 
3717	Driverless cars would be good in the future because nobody would have to spend money on cars when they can actually buy other thing that they need. The driverless cars would use half fuel today's taxis need. Which is going to make people save money. The driverless car would offer far more flexibility than a bus. 
3718	some students have more important or something that they need to accomplish but if they are doing community service they wont be able to. 
3719	some may have extra curricular activities they have to stay faithful to, assignments from teachers that have to be completed, some may even have a job they have to attend. So it would be hard for them to do all of these things and perform community service at the same time because they would have no free time in between and it would be hard to juggle all these things at once it would be very stressful on that person. 
3720	Another reason why i disagree with students having to do community service is because it will distract the students from focussing on what they have to do or want to 
3721	In conclusion i disagree with students having to perform community service. It is hard for a student to complete all the things that they need to and do community service, i think whenever a student has free time they should use their time on something they really want to do or need to because students have a lot to deal with and they deserve every minute of free time they get and shouldn't waste it all the time on community service . 
3722	Have you ever wanted to just kick back and relax while your car does all of the driving? Have you ever thought about how dangerous that could be? 
3723	I believe that semi or fully autonomous cars are a danger to the world. 
3724	The cars we have today run off of a computer, until it hits conditions it can not handle, requireing the driver to take over. In 2013, BMW made a vehicle that could run the car on its own, but the driver still had to hold on to the wheel. Many other cars have become semi autonomous, but require the driver to take over when there are different conditions, such as roadwork or there is an accident. Some of these semi auatonomous cars alert the driver when they need to take over, either by an indicator, physical vibration, or simply by announcing that the driver needs to take over. What if the driver falls asleep and the car fails to wake the driver to take control of the car? How safe is the car then? 
3725	The Google car for example, has sensors on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a camera on the rearvier mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS reciever, and an inertial motion sensor. The car runs off of all of these sensors, and needs every single one of them to run properly. But what happens if one of these sensors reade untrue values because they have malfunctioned or got covered up by something. Technology can only go so far into our lives before we are putting human life at risk. All it takes is one failure, one moment where a sensor isn't working correctly , and a persons life could be over. The sensors also cost money. This would make many of these cars almost unbuyable to the general public because of the cost of parts and matenience. 
3726	Does the manufactorer who made the car get blamed, or does the driver who purchased it take responsibility? I personally belive that these cars are an assumed risk and that if the car is in an accident, that both the driver and the manufacterer are to blame. I believe that the driver could have attempted to do something to change the cars path, but it is more so the manuacturers fault becasue their car failed to stay in its own lane and out of the way of other traffic. The blame also depends on who was inc ontrol at the time of the accident, if the driver had control of the car, it is his or her fault. But if the computer was running the car, then it is the manufacturers fault. 
3727	"These cars are not truly on autopilot, the technology is not completely reliable, and who is to blame for an accident? These points are all good reasons as to why these cars are a hazard to human life and should not be on our roads. So before you get right behind the idea of an autonomous car, think ""do i trust my life and others lives to a machine?""  "
3728	W.E.B DuBois, the influential civil rights activist and co founder of the NAACP, valued education and believed that it was the most important thing in life. However, most students do not share the same beliefs nowadays. They dread going to school because they have to wake up early and rush to get to school on time. They wish to wake up on their own and get the day going at their own pace. When a student has to rush to shcool against theirt will, it can increase stress and reduce productivity. This can be a huge obstacle in the path of their education. Some schools offer distance learning, which allows students to take classes at home through online or video conferencing 
3729	Taking classes online and at home is extremely beneficial for a student's learning 
3730	However, it is likely that students will take advantage of this feature in a negative way. The lack of commitment to the online learning can decrease their will to learn. They can skip class and not get anything done at home. In addition, there is a lot of room for malfunctions in the technology. 
3731	If there is no one available in person to help with these issues, online classes become useless. Yet, these factors play a crucial role in the student's development as a person. They teach the student discipline and time management. When a student skips an online class, the teacher will be able to know and punish them accordingly, whether it is lowering their grade or contacting their parents. This teaches the student not to skip classes. 
3732	Everyone, including me, has experienced a sickness, and chances are, they probably got it from someone at school. It is extremely easy for sicknesses and diseases to be transferred around in school. 
3733	This causes the student to stay home sick and not get any work done. This can be avoided by introducing distance learning. A huge and current example of this is COVAD-19, the coronavirus. It is massive pandemic that is shocking everyone around the world. There are thousands of deaths and cases worldwide. School systems, such as Generic_School Counties, are discussing the possibility of closing school and shifting classes to online to prevent the transfer of this deadly disease. This is a very smart decision because it slows down the spreading of the coronavirus in our area and it keeps the students and their families safe.  
3734	A more comfortable environment allows students to feel safe and makes work a little more relaxed and stress free. 
3735	When students are more relaxed and comfortable, they are more efficient and productive with their work. They face less pressure from other students and teachers. It makes their work more accurate. In addition, by finishing their work and online classes, they have more time to do what they want and relax. This serves as a motivation for the students to be as productive as possible. Online classes are far less time consuming because you don't have to go anywhere. You can simply wake up, open your device, and start learning; whereas if you're going to school, you have to get ready, travel to school, and sit bored in class wishing to go home. 
3736	Offering distance learning through online classes and video conferencing can help a lot in a student's path of education because it keeps them safe from breakout diseases and increases their productivity by making them more comfortable. The students face far less stress at home than they do at home. This results in a spike of productivity and even makes their grades better. Online classes should definitely be introduced to more schools because it is a really useful tool in helping the student become a better learner and person by teaching discipline and time management skills. 
3737	Although virtual learning provides a more personalized learning experience for students, the consequences of implementing online classes outweigh the benefits. 
3738	"The classroom setting and environment offers students a wide variety of ways to exercise their social skills and develop character by interacting with different individuals. For an example, many individuals who are confined inside their homes are unable to participate in healthy activities that involve engaging with other students such as sports, clubs, organizations, and other extracurricular activities. Oftentimes, the individual who finds themselves being accustomed to this way of learning have identified themselves as ""anti-social"" or socially awkward. This is due to the fact that they prefer to isolate themselves from group settings or from social events because they are apprehensive and, sometimes even, hostile towards others who attempt to change their habits "
3739	Some may argue that online classes have the ability to engage its students with insightful discussions with their teacher and peers online. 
3740	However, physical presence plays a vital role in developing relationships and allowing students to overcome their social anxiety. 
3741	Like any technological application, individuals typically use online platforms and sites to display a persona and in this case, online classes encourages these students to strengthen their online presence, but not their physical one. In terms of longevity, this method does not strengthen crucial life and work skills that they are expected to have when they join the workforce; it is simply unrealistic. These students are encouraged to hide behind a screen because they lack social skills, and they justify this practice because the education system glamorizes the idea of their innovative society. Overall, online classes not only affect their learning experience, but their social skills. 
3742	Furthermore, online classes are not preparing individuals to face the reality of the workforce and the legitimacy of this method is ambiguous. 
3743	"The whole purpose of providing the youth with education is to be able to train them to become independent enough to be self-sufficient in the real world. In a school or classroom environment, they learn valuable teamwork skills that allow them to cooperate and collaborate with other individuals about how to approach an issue, overcome challenges, and propose a solution. This eventually leads to the building of bonds and relationships that could impact an individual's life or mental health, whereas online schooling encourages the opposite effect of this. By physically going to school, these individuals nurture their abilities to be problem-solvers and natural thinkers. Additionally, some students may not take online classes seriously as opposed to physically showing up for class. For an example, online students may not require a time constraint and does not require the students to be properly dressed for the ""class."" Sometimes, the individual may present themselves to an online class in their pajamas because they woke up an hour ago. This does not exemplify sophistication nor does the class seem respected. On the other hand, if the student were to show up to school, they would look much more prepared and willing to learn. This highlights the difference between individuals who value their education and the ones who do not. "
3744	Most schools consist of people from various races, ethnicities, backgrounds, sexes, and learning capabilities. Not every student thinks the same way, so they should be encouraged to express their creativity to establish a diverse school setting. Additionally, some students may possess specific learning disabilities such as ADHD, dyslexia, autism, mental illnesses, and more. In this case, these students require much more attention from their teachers to help guide them through this process, but an online class can only do so much. The teachers may be going at a faster pace than what these students can normally handle or they are confused about a certain area of the subject, so their frustrations may build up and lead to detrimental effects on their mental health. Although it is considered to be personalized learning, these individuals require careful guidance towards achieving the same success that their counterparts are experiencing. In the sense of virtual learning, these individuals are at a disadvantage because their learning disabilities are beyond their control. Video conferencing may be an option, but students with learning disabilities prefer not to share with their peers that they are struggling in a certain area or having difficulties understanding the curriculum, but would much rather keep this information confidential between themselves and their teachers. 
3745	To sum it all up, the Electoral college is just an unnecassary back up plan when there is not one needed. It is unfair to the citizens and the candidate's electors are unreliable. If there was a way to keep the Electoral College, it would only be for ties. It wouldnt be needed if the vote was a clean win. When the President Election comes in the next 3 years, I hope that you consider my thoughts, because there are plenty people out there with the same perspective.    
3746	Personally, I believe that for some students, learning from home may be a much more beneficial method of schooling 
3747	online school could allow for more freedom in class pacing. 
3748	A school in it's own can sometimes feel much too clinical for students, too professional, and way too pressuring of an environment. This is why for some students, it may actually be better if they learn from home. For me at least, I find school to be a suffocating environment, where you are surrounded by the pressure of other students and other teachers. One wrong move and your grade could be failing, and you have to face your teacher with that fact. The way I see it, that is way too much pressure to put on a student, for them to feel scared in an environment that is supposed to feel nurturing and calm. Instead, school feels like a prison, and the strict rules and guidelines are what push students to fail. This is why I believe that if students work from home, they will feel much more relaxed, and thus will do much better in classes. Students have a comfort zone, and sometimes a school building and environment crosses that comfort zone, which causes for poor performance 
3749	If school was taught from home or online, students would feel more comfortable and thus would do better. 
3750	If school was taught online, student would be able to control their class pacing much better than if it was taught in person 
3751	In a normal classroom, your teacher has a strict course schedule that he/she must keep to, and thus forcing students to keep to a strict routine of coursework. I can say this from my personal experience, since I too have dealt with the pressure of having multiple assignments due back to back, and having to turn them in on time or else my grade would suffer for my ignorance. Classes force students of differing levels of learning to all adapt to the same course schedule, with no room for fluctuation, and this is why their grades suffer. If school was to be taught from home or online, while there would still be due dates, it would not have to be as strict. Students could have more freedom to choose how their assignments are to get done and when they needed to be completed. Instead of being forced into some strict class schedule, students would have the rights and the freedom to choose, and I believe that you would see a great difference in their grades. This is why I will argue for school to be taught from home or online, since students would greatly benefit from it. 
3752	School should be taught from home or taught online, because I believe that most, if not all, students would benefit from it. Students would not have to deal with the harsh environment of a school and they would get ability to decide their class pacing better then in school teaching. I believe that all teachers want is for their students to succeed, but how can a student excel when the school system is dampening their motivations with poor environments. As a student myself, I can say with absolute certainty that I would benefit from having school from home. I would not have to feel the pressure of a harsh testing environment and I would never have to deal with teachers, who were frustrated that I could not complete their too many assignments on their due dates. Students need fluidity, and the rigid structure of our school system today is not helping them to succeed. The only way that I see that students would be able to act on full capacity would be to switch to a completely online school system.  
3753	the electoral college restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states by population lose by virtue of the mal- apportionment of the senate decreed in the constitutuion 
3754	The cars still need the help of people to perform some activities. 
3755	The cars also will have millions of sensors that at any one point if one goes bad the whole car would not be able to function properly. 
3756	Driving also requires the driver to be alert at all times. 
3757	Driverless cars are going to have ways to entertain the driver instead of keeping the driver focused on the task at hand. 
3758	In paragraph 4 the prompt talks about the cars using LIDAR which is a device that projects a laser and spins on top of the car. Every rotation showing the computer the cars surroundings. While on the road however the LIDAR could spin around and before it get around again an object could have found its way to being in the path of the car giving the car, depending on its speed, hardly any or no time to react. Other sensors could go bad or just the slightest miscalculation or glitch in anything could spell disaster for the car and its passenger(s). These cars should not be developed given today's unreliable technology. 
3759	"In paragraph 8 the questions, ""Why would anyone want a driverless car that still needs a driver?"" and, ""Wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive?"", were asked. In the same paragraph the author answers the question by saying, ""We have to interpret the driving fun in new way."" Manufacturers hope to fix that problem by introducing ""in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays.""(Paragraph 8) These same ideas contradict the claim in paragraph 9 that says, ""Most driving laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best acieved with alert drivers."" How can drivers be alert if they are busy ""having fun"" before the car decides to hand over the controls to the driver. "
3760	"Driverless cars should not be developed because they still require human assistance, there are too many things that can go wrong with the technology required, and that driving takes alert drivers, the same drivers that are going to be ""entertained"" while they wait for their turn to drive. "
3761	A president election is great but, there are some difficulties along the way of deciding who will be able to vote. People are asking themselves whether or not they should keep the electorial vote or get rid of it and have a popular voting method. To me, the popular voting method is reasonable. 
3762	its fair to the voters 
3763	YOU are able to vote for the president of your choice, 
3764	because of the winner-take-all system. 
3765	The electorial collage should be changed to the popular voting method because it is unfair to the voters. 
3766	"Eeveryone should have a say in what goes on where ever it is that they live. We the people make up the government. Who draws the line that states whether or not you are allowed to vote. We do! Therefore we should be able to decied ourselves who can be our president to the United States of America. It is niot fair that we need to elect others to have our submission be made. Even when we tell our electors who we choose, they might turn arouhd and vote for the other person. In  Source 2 ""The indefensible electorial college : why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer""  backs up my response when stating,""In the same vein, 'faithless' electors have ocasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please..."". That to me my friend, is not fair at all. "
3767	With the popular voting method you are able to choose the president of your choice, not the president's electors. 
3768	"In doing this you are having a fair vote in the election with everyone who is eligable to vote, voting whomever they please. If you vote for your own president of your choice there will not be any elector deciding for you if they do not like what you have elected. We need to have a say in what we want. I mean if we want someone to be watching over us, and deciding what to do, we want someone who everyine agrees on. Just a few hundred poeoplpe choosing for you is nothing compared to approximatley more than a million people choosing for themselves. In  Source 2 ""The indefensible electorial college : why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer""  it says that the electors can always defy the will of the people. In my case I believe that no one would want that. I mean, would you want that? "
3769	"People don't usually spend time in states they know the don't have a chance at winning. Who would? these states only focus on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. Sometime around the 2000 campaign, apporximately 17 states didn't at all see those candidates. Even when there were voters in states that had 25 of the largest media markets, they were not able to see not even one ad from the campaign. This is being said in  Source 2 ""The indefensible electorial college : why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer"" "
3770	For my conclusion this proves that there are many difficulties along the way of an election, regarding the votes and voters. With this letter being written, people should not wonder whether or not the electoral college should be abolished, and go with the popluar voting method. You shouldn't be thinking about just a couple of people, but of a whole nation and deciding who is worthy enough in our eyes to lead us to more victories with the popular voting method.    
3771	Although, the only true downside to this is if your texting it does not always get to the other persons phone right away, depending on the amount of signal you or they have it could take 5 seconds or it could take 30 minutes 
3772	I believe that students have the right to choose what they would rather do, instead of being forced to do so.  
3773	Even though community service is the right thing to do, it should not be forced upon anybody. 
3774	The students need some of their own freedom.  We are already facing being a teenager and school.  We need to be able to make a few more decisions in our everyday lives.  
3775	On the other hand, every student performing community service will help the city extremely well. 
3776	The streets will be cleaner, the buildings shinier, and the gardens greener.  Everyone in the city will leave their homes with a smile on their face!  
3777	For example, one of my friends volunteers at an elementary school as a tutor.  He enjoys it a lot, especially when one of the kids gets a good grade on something he taught them. 
3778	However, some of my other friends don't like the idea of community service because it takes away from their free time. 
3779	Personally, I am not liking the idea of being forced to make the city a better place.  It shouldn't be part of the curriculum.  The students should make the decision themselves.  
3780	During anyone's time in school whether it is a private school or a public school they encounter other students which helps develop social skills which are important to survive in the real world. The online schooling would not only make those who take it feel like their alone but it will make their adult life far more difficult 
3781	In the real world, future adults will have contact with a lot of people and students who had an interaction with other students will have an easier time doing so in their adult life. Unlike kids who spent their time in a room all by themselves learning, they will have to adapt to having interactions with other people. For example if a student who took the online classes in a future job had to present something for his boss, the student would have a difficult time getting his point across to other people because of the missing interaction with other people during their developmental years. Now if a student who attended school with other people did this it would be much easier for them because they would know how to talk to others and get their point across. 
3782	Sure there may be the usual kid that does not want to be around other people but there's not many of them. For example my friends and I enjoy coming to school because we see each other and also because it has a sense of competition in terms of who has the better grades. I think when other kids are around and doing better than you it makes you want to try harder. Second if a student you sat next to in math class or in history was doing better than you in your mind you would say, oh i want to be like that, making you want to try harder and ultimately do better in school. In any competition teams push themselves to the limit, whether its a race, the final of a championship game or the last play in the game, teams try their hardest because the other team is doing so as well. Students will do that too, but they need other students to compete with which would not happen in online school. 
3783	No matter who you are, you have your lazy moments. You have those moments where you just don't want to do anything, these moments usually happen at the comfort of your own home. Times like this are easily avoided by attending school, the student wakes up in the morning gets ready, walks to their bus stop and off they go to school. A student who has class at home may or may not forget about their class or even worse know they have it and decide not to do it because they are at home. There is no choice in whether you will go to school today or not, most of the time it's a yes, your parents say you have to go to school and that is what you have to do. Online classes can be avoided if the student just does not do it. Students are supervised in school at all times whether its administration during lunch, or by a teacher in class. Who is going to supervise the student at home? if a parent is home they might do it but if there is no parent it's up to the student to make that decision and its usually a I am too tired to do this.  
3784	Changing the voting system to popular vote will give all of us that reassurance we need, such as knowing our voices are being heard. 
3785	I've heard about the situation on the community service idea. But is it really our choice to choose for other people? Shouldn't the students have a voice on there own opinion wether they do community service. Or even if the whole school does community service. Our school should have a vote on this situation so that our school will come to an understanding. Some of the students believe that the community service wastes there time. While others believe that it is good for our community and will help our country in the long run. Our school will be chaos if we do not solve our problems now. 
3786	Most children these day have about a C not a B because they are more focus on the sport then the grades. 
3787	Driverless cars are coming in the future. In the future, no one will probably need to buy cars because they won't need them. According to Google cofounder Sergey Brin, that will happen. He sees a future with a public transportation system where fleets of driverless cars form a public- transport taxi system. The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus. There are many great things about driveless cars, but there are some bad things as well.  
3788	Driverless cars have way more senors and alerts than regular cars. 
3789	Driverless cars are also very safe to use. 
3790	"The cars can handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mile per hour, but special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel. Even though the word ""driverless"" may scare you, none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. Which means you are still somewhat in control of the car. The cars may be able to steer, accelerate and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents. The driver must stay alert and be ready to take over when the time comes. The car can quickly get the driver's attention whenever a problem occurs. GM has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. Other options under consideration are flashing lights on the windshield and other heads-up displays. Basically, while the driver watches the road, the car watches the driver. (Paragraph 7) "
3791	Driverless cars are going to become the next big thing. They won't just become beneficial to you, but everyone else as well. 
3792	It could end up causing you to end up in a wreck, or maybe it won't slow down and the brakes won't work. Even though you are alert, what can you do if something goes wrong? Nothing. If the car can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves there is not a whole lot you can do to stop it. You just never know with a driverless car. You are putting yourself ar risk while you are in the car because you are not 100% in control of the car and that is not safe. 
3793	In conclusion, driverless cars are very safe and have major benefits. Some people may be scared of letting a car be in a control, instead of them being in control of the car. But no one should have nothing to worry about. As long as you stay alert, you should be fine. Even though the car can do many things by itself, it still sends you heads up when it needs your assistance. Driverless cars coming very soon in the near future. Try them and see how they are. 
3794	While some say that the Electoral College goes against America's democratic ideals and it increases the probability for a disastrous vote, the Electoral College still gives Ameican citizens some sway in the election and with a completely democratic system of voting there is a good chance that the outcome could be even more disastrous. 
3795	The Electoral college is a compromise of voting between citizens and the government 
3796	it represents the people as evenly as it can 
3797	it still gives voters a collective chance to change the outcome of an election. 
3798	One reason that the Electoral college works so well is that it is not completely run by the people or run by the government. 
3799	The Electoral College does not give a single voter a chance to sway an election, however America's population as a whole is represented. 
3800	Not one region or state has enough electoral votes to elect a president (Par 19 and 21).  This is a good thing because canidates pay equal attention to all of America's people.  Also, in the Electoral College, not every state has the same amount of electoral votes because every state has a different population size.  
3801	This might seem like unequal representation of that states 
3802	but the election is not meant to give each state an equalized vote, it is meant to give the population of america an even representation. 
3803	Swing states give America's people a chance to decide an elections outcome. 
3804	In swing states the voters are very thoughtful about their canidates because they know that in the their case, that their vote really does count (par 20).  It is good to have voters who are very thoughtful and catious about their vote.  The Electoral Colleges encourages this type of behavior among citizens by giving voters a chance to sway an  election in swing states.  Swing states can impact an election.  They are an example of how the Electoral College, while still not completely democtratic, still gives the people a vote. 
3805	Through the Electoral College America's population is represented, the government and it's citizens have equal representation, and American people can still impact the outcome of an election.  The founding fathers of America thought of this while they created the foundation that our country proudly stands on.  The Electoral College should stay as it is.  It still works effectively to decide on who will become president.  As long as the College works effectively, then ther should be no issue with it.    
3806	"I'd like to take some of your time to shed some light on the matter of having popular vote for the president of the United states.""We the people "" ,That stands strong in our society and I'd like it to stay that way.Majority of the people,Thats what its about.Over 60% have voted to have popular vote to elect our president.Thats over half,and numbers speak.Yes,The electoral college has its good but over all bad,There is so much trust put into each states electors and some voters dont even know it. "
3807	The number one fault in the electoral college is the electors themselfs 
3808	I understand the good in the electoral college though.It helps keep states from tieing ,and causing chaos. 
3809	But,We the people do not have our justice in that manner.If the winning vote is casted by state the legislatures are techinally responsible for picking the eletors in favor of the vote. 
3810	If we want to keep America fair and keep our pride in our country we should most defaintly start electing our presidents by popular vote,instead of relying on an out dated system that has many faults and injustce 
3811	My opinion on this issue is to require community service to all of the students of our school 
3812	What these kids are saying is, on a rough estimation, in 3,600 hour school year the don't have just 10 hours of that time to give back to their community? I find that pretty hard to believe, and I hope you would to. I have to agree that students lives are very full these days, but the can make time for their community that makes there lives full. On my opinion on refusing to do community service is either the person is lazy, or just plain mean. The students may not realize it not, but community is definitely worth their time. After doing community service, the students will have a satisfying feeling, knowing they did something good, and benefited their community. You never know, they just might like community service.  
3813	"The Electoral College is ""unfair,outdated,and irrational"". if the Electoral College is unfair why should should the U.S keep this process in our goverment? who really knows? But on the other hand popular votes is a great way to keep voteing fair and rattional to the U.S citizens "
3814	First of all,their are many reasons popular votes are way more usefull and fair then the Electoral College 
3815	last,popular votes/majority rule are in all a better way of voteing in the U.S because of the fairness and rights the U.S citizens all deserve,yes the Electoral College votes are easier but in the end who really wins? noboby does 
3816	If i was to be voted for president i would like to be voted by Electoral College because , electoral college is not voted for the presidents it is voted for the electors , who in turn elect the president . In conclusion , each candidate running for president in your state has thier own group of electors. 
3817	To the older people the younger people may take out the trash for them, mow their lawns, etc. If that would happen this world would be an better place. A place where everyone would get along and peaceful. 
3818	under that sytem, voters don't vote for presidents they vote for slate of electors who then elect the president and can elect someone completely different than who the voter wanted to be president. 
3819	"How does the Electoral College affect the selection of the presidency and is it a positive force? Many may answer ""No."" or ""I don't know."" to these questions, only doing such because that's what they've been or what they've heard others say. "
3820	While many have negative feelings, or no feelings at all, towards the Electoral College, it is a very useful force in electing the President because of its 
3821	certainty 
3822	its transregionality, 
3823	"and it lets ""the most thoughtful voters"" (Posner Source 3) decide the election. "
3824	"And in turn voters in these states will definitely receive ""the most information and attention from the candidates"" (Posner Source 2). Voters from these states at the end of the campaigns will no doubt be the most informed voters in the nation, giving them the right to decide the fate of the election for the future. "
3825	"While popular voting can be skewed naturally to one region or another due to their preferences and populations, the Electoral College ensures that one region can't win a campaign alone. If the President was to win due to popular vote and only because of regional appeal, ""residents of other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised..."" (Posner Source 3) and that their president will not best represent everyone's interests. "
3826	"Although there was one ""fiasco"" in 2000, as Bradford Plumer calls it in Source 2, "
3827	"the chance of this happening is very small since ""even a very slight pulrality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state."" (Posner Source 3) For example, in 2012, Obama recieved 61.7 percent of electoral vote while he recieved only 51.3 percent of the popular vote.(Posner Source 3). A 1.3 percent from a tie is much, much more close than the 11.7 percent that that the Electoral College gives us. "
3828	While some may still believe that the Electoral College is outdated and unneccesary, the usefulness of the swing states, its transregional approval system, and its certainty over popular voting proves it to be the best method of selecting our presidents for now and for the future.                    
3829	because it could help us students have a better look into life, 
3830	have a better appreciation of what you and teachers do for us 
3831	and we can kind of learn what we want to do when we're older. 
3832	is we could help younger kids like teachers do and might want to become a teacher in the future. We could also use the experience as we get older in jobs or with our own life style. this like a prospect that we use to our advantage. It could help some us be less likely to become criminals. It will probably be one of the best things that could happen to certain students. 
3833	It will ensure that only those who are willing to do the work and try hard will appear on the sports teams and academic groups, bettering the program. Yet I also feel that this pushes the boundaries of the 'no pass no play' rule very far. 
3834	I think that students should have a choice in this yet I can't help thinking that this would help solve problems, so i am forced to vote for this new rule. 
3835	those who aren't willing to do the work in order to compete obviously don't care much or they would aim for that higher grade and try harder. This will teach them a valuable lesson in life. 
3836	Think, what would happen in your life as an adult if your boss told you that he needed you to do something he needed done. Many would say yes in order to please their boss. those who are not willing to work hard to do what even extra activities would probably not be willing to put out the effort for a job. what happens then? You are fired! This would show them to put more effort in order to succeed. the newly proposed rule is a wonderful idea, and will eventually provide the educational system with a higher amount of success in individual schools. 
3837	Students go above and beyond their usual school habits and they will have to study hard and work to get the B average. 
3838	There are some students that even though they try their hardest, they will not be able to get the B average because of their inability to work at a high level. 
3839	If this is the case, then the school must provide extra help classes and study sessions with the teachers to make sure that the kids have the opportunity to play for a sports team or participate in any other school activities. If this policy were to go into effect today, then you would see a huge spike in student's grade point average. 
3840	There are students that would go the extra mile to be on a sports team or join other activities. These students will seek additional help if they do not believe they can maintain B averages 
3841	. On the downside, there will be a few students who will not want to work to get the B average and they will not participate in sports or other activities. 
3842	This could cause the sports teams to become less talented then they were before because some of the talent might not care enough to try and get the B average. 
3843	But, if you would like your students to try and work more efficently and coopretively, then this policy could be the right the thing to enforce in the school. 
3844	. It may be because they are not very good test takers or their study habits are very poor. Some might not be able to concentrate and they get distracted very easily. It would be unfair for these students because of their inability to maintain the B average. The school would be responsible for not letting these kids participate in sports and other activities; therefore, in order to give them a better chance at getting the B average, the school should provide tutoring and extra help sessions for the kids who really need the help. The teachers could give them verbal quizzes on what they are learning if they are not very good test takers. They could give them homework that they might better understand and also provide them with extra credit opportunites. The sports teams may despretley need a kid that is very athletic, but not very smart and if this policy were to go into effect, then the school must provide the additional help. 
3845	In conclusion, I believe that this is a very fair and reasonable policy. It will force kids to work out to their full potential, and they will have better grade point averages. The students must fully accept their responsibilty to live up to this potential so that the students, faculty, and coaches will be satisfied with the students. 
3846	I believe that the school cell phone policy should be that all students should have their cell phones off at all times at school 
3847	because it keeps them focused on their work 
3848	having a cell phone could get them in trouble. 
3849	First of all keeping your cell phone off at school enables students to focus completely on their work. 
3850	For example if we could have our cell phones out nobody would be thinking of the lesson or would even bother to tune into the class because obviously a phone is a perfect way to chat with your friends while the teacher isn't looking. This makes it difficult for the person sending the messages AND the one receiving them because both are having their attention pulled away from what's important (class) and what's not (socializing). Another example is even if the rule says that cell phones can only be used during free time students will be using them all the time ignoring the rule. Honestly anybody can quickly put the phone under the table and text a quick message to their friend but in that short second the teacher could've been explaining something crucial to the development of the students skills. And just missing that one little thought the student is now behind because of it. As you can see cell phones will be a major disruption to the students if allowed for them to have them in school. 
3851	Second of all having a cell phone will most likely cause you to get in trouble. 
3852	I know one of my friends did. He thought he was so slick that he could just take out his cell phone and try to cheat on a test with another person. He asked for the answers to the questions on the test and while he was busy typing it out little did he know that the teacher was watching him the whole time. The teacher had to stop everybody that was taking the test and had to figure out who was cheating. After that his phone was token away from him and was in major trouble. Not only was it not worth it to get in trouble for this but it distracted the whole class and academically took away from everybody's experience. Yet another time that someone got in trouble was when my friend decided to send explicit text messages to his girlfriend. Now if that wasn't bad enough he did it during class, when everybody was watching. Now he didn't caught on his end but when the girlfriend received the message someone heard it and said something. The teacher then confiscated the phone and found the messages. She looked at who sent it and reported it to the office. Both people involved were sent to the office and were in major trouble involving parents and everything. This type of behavior would not be uncommon if the cell phone policy was instituted. 
3853	In the year 2000 there was a presidental election. The two canadate runnning were Bush and Gore. In that election there was a problem, Gore had won the votes of the people but Bush had won the votes of the the Electoral votes. Now the question is asked who should win, should the person who had the most votes from the people win or the person who had the most votes from the Electoral College win? This is something that has been going on for a long time, does the Electoral College over rule the people? This is an importain question that we the people should be asking, do we realy pick the persendent or does the Electoral College pick it and we are just there for show? 
3854	The Electoral College is an out dated sistem that we keep because the goverment wants there to be a clear winner, but we know that is not what the people the people want the right to dicide. 
3855	But there is the problem that not all winners of electoral votes will not win the national vote; such an instance happened in 2000, when Al Gore had more popular votes than George Bush, yet fewer electoral votes. 
3856	The subject of the Electoral Coolege's method of selecting a president is controversial in the sense that it may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state, such as Democrats in Texas, or Republicans in California,when they know their vote will have no effect, their incentive is much less than if it were picked by popular vote 
3857	Would you rather be a cockroach or an ant? This isn't in a size match up but a living condition. A lone ranger roach or a society of workers like the ants. The same aspect can be applied to when people ask if offering classes at home would be beneficial for students. Students that would take classes at home would be enclosed away from peers and friends, while a student at school would be surrounded by peers and many people alike. 
3858	So to a small extent students would benefit from being able to attend class from home, because this would let them learn at their own pace as well as in their best learning technique. 
3859	However, to a greater extent students would be at a loss from taking classes at home, 
3860	they would lose their social interaction 
3861	challenges brought on by the environment of schools. 
3862	Education is about efficiently farming the minds of youth to grow great minds. Without the challenge of competing peers and uncomfortable situations for students the techniques would be less effective. To begin there is evidence to support that students in unfamiliar habitats like a school test better than students that are familiar with their testing environment. So students learning from home would test worse than students at school just due to the simple fact that they are more relaxed in their environment. Continuing, in schools peers push the learning potential upon themselves because of the social hierarchy with grade status. This is a key element with having a generalized system, this system creates competition among students to be at the top. 
3863	The ability to take classes at home would hinder the students inner strength by proposing no challenge for them. 
3864	If you never went to school or work, how many friends would you have? 
3865	Students offered classes at home would have minimal social life due in part to the lack of social interaction with the people in their area. 
3866	Students make life long friends from school: college roommates, kindergarten best friend, or high school sweethearts. Taking away the random dice roll of interactions by lowering the rate at which kids interact would create students with minimal social lives and students more likely to become sad or depressed. Students taking classes from home would loose touch with societal standards and become worse adults by not respecting things like: dress codes, rules of the office, or authority figures. This would be because of the lowered interaction with these rules and could lead to people who aren't mentally tough. Students without friends would become lost in society and could be unable to speak about their situation because of their lack of original social interaction.  
3867	Students taking online classes could have the ability to learn better, this is because they could learn at their own rate and they could learn with their best suited technique. 
3868	Students aren't all the same, and having one technique used on all can hinder some of their abilities. Students taking online classes could use outside resources for study and this could create the situation best suited for their learning style. This could lead to better retention of the knowledge and a greater understanding of the material. Students could take the course at their speed, this could mean some would finish faster than others, but the main argument in this is students would have better material retention because they would be in the mindset of learning and not just going through the motions of school. Online school has its niche benefits for its population of students willing to take the toll.  
3869	To conclude students are better off taking classes at school, but there is a small population of students that taking online classes could work better for. Students would have to test out the options first and see what works best. Because even though online school sounds good on paper, it could very well be horrid in practice. Students always want to find the easy way out, and online school could be that no challenge road. That would lead to a greater number of students failing out of rigorous courses, and a potential of uneducated students because of a lower retention of material. Overall students should stay in school because it would create the fun challenging environment and a better social understanding for students. 
3870	I think helping out in the community would be fun.  To me helping people out is a good way for people to get to know you.  It also helps make out world look better! 
3871	I believe that the electoral college should be abolished. 
3872	Think back to a little over a decade ago, to the 2000 presidential elections. Al gore received the popular vote, meaning that he was the one that us, the americans had wanted. 
3873	Due to the fact that George W. Bush, his rival, received more electoral votes, Bush won, leaving an unfavored president running the country. According to source 2, a gallup poll was taken shortly after Gore had lost the presidency, an entire 60 percent of voters would prefer to have a direct vote, rather than go through the electoral process.  
3874	Granted, that the electoral college does give a certainty of outcome and that no region on its own can vote for a president, it does give an equal chance for everybody to have their mostly preffered president 
3875	"there is however some flaws to these so called ""pros"". Faithless electors exist. These electors totally ignore what the people have to say and cast their own vote. "
3876	Students should be required to help the community because otherwise the community could turn into a bad looking place 
3877	Students should help out where help is needed the most like homeless shelters or cleaning up trash around town. 
3878	Students should have to have community service but be able to choose what to do so that they will want to do it again 
3879	First and foremost I believe that we live in a community that is well kept and organized, and it should remain that way. The generations before us have given us a place filled with love and care , a place of neat parks and recreation centers, a place we can call home. 
3880	This way of life should be kept up and exercised by our generation and the ones seceding us. 
3881	Community service gives everyone a chance to give back and help out, whether young or old. 
3882	where the food banks are over filled with volunteers; where people don't hate jury duty; where people are true patriots; where people don't have to get sentenced just to pick up trash. 
3883	It happened in Hawii in 1960. Luckily, Vice President Richard Nixon, who presided over the senate validated only his opponents electors making sure to do so ' without establishing a precedent. 
3884	Many students are at a grade C average and are playing meaning that they are already trying their best to be in the sports.  
3885	When a student is pushed a little to do better they react accordingly but, when they are pushed to across their limit they tend to feel overwhelmed and agitated 
3886	This overwhelming feeling can lead to procrastination and laziness, which will lower their grades which would then lead to a domino effect until they are failing. This could happen or the student would feel that they do not need to go to school anymore because they have nothing to look forward to there. Then the student may influence others and create a ring of truancy which is worse than low grades. 
3887	The students who enjoy these extracurricular activities usually are concentrating on doing their best in sports or their extracurricular activities, if we could move their priorities without side effects we could be able to reach higher levels of learning although a grade B average sounds like the best thing to do for this, it is not. 
3888	Sometimes when students have a large load of homework or tests they feel the need to relax and forget about their stress, but if they need to get even higher grades the outcome would be either of these three extremes, extremely low grades, truancy, high grades (but not enough time for sports) without a lot of time students agitation would reach to a point where they might resort to drastic efforts to relieve stress, like suicide. This would then mold the school into an unfriendly jail cell, and other students will be effected. 
3889	Instead of a grade B average as the policy, you should have a tutor at the extracurricular activities who can put in a little bit of teaching while the students are having fun. 
3890	Also if you can design rewards for students with higher grades the students with low grades will want to reap from the tree of knowledge to receive rewards, this in turn will yield higher grades, less procrastination, less anger, and all without any harmful side effects. 
3891	Also, the Electoral College should change the election by poplular vote for the president of the United States because, when choosing your's elctors when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors. 
3892	The Electoral College is a process where voters select electors who then vote for the President of the United State. But is it really that reliable? Is it better than an election decided by that of popular vote.  
3893	Another critical error is that in the process of the Electoral College is that not all states are equally represented. 
3894	For example if there is a tie in the Electoral vote the election would be handed to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the presedent. This wouldnt be fair because since each state casts only one vote, then the single representativ from Wyoming would only represent 500,000 voters. However the single representative from California would represent 35 million voters. That hardly seems fair. 
3895	"As source three states ""... the Electoral College is not democratic in a modern sense. With popular vote everyone would be represented equally. "
3896	"I understand that ""the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote"" causes less chance of a dispute over the Electoral college than of the popular vote "
3897	Also i understand that the Electoral College avoids run off elections 
3898	 I agree with the terms that to participate in sports and other activities, that you must have at least a grade B average. Although many students have a grade C average, I think it's best to follow through with this policy. It would help students in school, as well as make the teams and activities a more stricter, nicer team. 
3899	Students should have to have at least a grade B average to be on the school's sports teams or in any other activities. 
3900	By doing this, the students at our school will be smarter and more mature. The student will have to wok very hard to achieve a grade B average and will have to study more. Tests scores will go up and because the students want such good grades that they will have to pay attention during class; therefore, the students won't act out in class, as well as the activities they are in. They will care about the team or club and do their best. I think the policy for having a grade B average to be on activities at the school should be a yes. 
3901	Students with a grade B average will be rounded quite well, for they will have the smarts, as well as the athletics. 
3902	Everyone can make a grade B average, so this policy would not be unfair. It would challenge the students to do there best on every paper they turn in. The students would also learn new study skills, as well as fundamental organization skills that are needed in everyday life. If students could keep up with all their school stuff, study good, and keep good grades, then collage will be easier when it comes their time. It's proven that students that make the better grades do better in college and other activities, then the ones that make less decent grades. 
3903	To have the kids that are in clubs or on sports teams that have a grade B average or better, they will have more smarts to carry out plays better. 
3904	If the quarter back on the football team doesn't have the right fundamentals down, then the quarterback is useless. Smarts also help in groups. For a student to have a grade B average, then they must have some type of leadership in them. So for a grade B average student to be in a club or something of that nature, then the group will have a better bonding. They will be able to work together and develop into a team or group. Brainstorming ideas for ways to help the community will be able to be organized and arranged neatly. 
3905	Having the students maintain an grade B average at our school is a policy that should be passed.  Helping the students think for themselves, giving them necessary elements in life, and keeping them well rounded; this is what the policy offers. I think that the policy should be passed. It helps kids grow to be better adults, as well as help them in other situations in life. By doing the policy, it enhancing our generation, as well as many to come. Instead of more and more kids just barely making the grades, they will work towards being the best student they could be. The teachers are happy, the students feel proud of their grades, and all the activities are filled with smart wonderful children, this is why the policy you are suggesting should be passed and should be started in our school. 
3906	I believe that the way of voting for a president though the Electoral College is outdated. The popular vote should be deciding who becomes president. 
3907	"Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states.""(source 2) which means that they won't visit every state because there is no reason to visit some. "
3908	"If there ever is a deadlock in the campiagn the voting will have to go to the house which will be mostly filled with the majority side. So the minority won' have much of a chance."" Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state."" (source 3) that means a close election isn't so close anymore because of Electoral vote. But some people will say u can never get a tie. "" A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes-538- is an even number.""(source 3) "
3909	If the state uses a different system such as counting votes from different states, we wouldn't have as much problems we have with it now because the votes in the electoral college are outdated and irrational, 
3910	Community service has been part of many peoples lives in this world. Many people do community service to help others and better this world. 
3911	Well i think doing community service should be a grown ups job to do not a student or any kid in the world. 
3912	Students shouldn't be wasting their time i something they don't want do. 
3913	They have a lot in head for ex. school , homework , siblings they have to take car of , after school programs , and sports they have to go to go to ! 
3914	If a student is failing a class or classes and needs points to pass their class require them to do community service. 
3915	All students shouldn't to be require to do community service , only the people that need it. Its just a waste of time in a kids life , even though they know that they are doing something good in this world by helping others. 
3916	The electoral college has many inherint flaws that make it less desirable than a simple election by popular vote. It's only rebuttals to said flaws are weak, and provide little to no reason why the college is beneficial. So there is no real reason to have it in the first place. 
3917	Popular vote stands to not only correct the errors of the electoral college, but also to refine our voting system 
3918	and forcing the candidates to win over more people. 
3919	It is more liberating than a dictatorship or monarchy in which people are governed by a higher class, which is more often than not decided by someone other than themselves. In a democracy however, people are given the ability to put who they desire in office. They have the ability to be governed by the person of their choice. This, however, is impeded upon by the electoral college. Because what it does is simply insert a middle man into an otherwise democratic society. We are forced to rely on people we elect to vote for us. Which is irrational as it is completely unecessary. The extra step only sets us up for deception and betrayal. I mean why would you trust a man on the street to cast a vote for you when doing so yourself is much more reliable? 
3920	Though why does it even matter if the candidate you want to vote for won't even come to your state? There's obviously no reason to vote democrat if your say will simply be overshadowed by the wave of republicans in your area. 
3921	With popular vote though, candidates should be more inclined to visit as many states as possible and get their message out there. Because a 51% vote in a state no longer means a 100% victory. With the new influx of political campaigns, perhaps more people are swayed from their usual path of voting. While yes, there are neutral states that need a push either way, you're not going to increase your votes ten-fold by pushing past that 50% barrier. You actually have to earn every vote you get. 
3922	Next community service shouldn't be optional because it builds character. 
3923	Lastly, community service is important because it gets people off their couch and in to the streets helping people. 
3924	As a student of this school, I believe it is very necessary to require community service at our school, 
3925	although many students will not appreciate this, in the long run they will learn to appreciate what they are given and begin to act less selfish and more selfless. 
3926	Community service will also give them a sense of accomplishment and more responsibility, 
3927	this will indeed create a busy lifestyle therefore not giving time to do unnecessary or harmful things to themselves of the student body. 
3928	This act of community service will allow all students to learn and experience new things and better themselves for their future. 
3929	I also believe the school administration should create a presentation showing students that this can be indeed a very fun task! 
3930	For example, if a students enjoys pets' he/she can volunteer at their local pet adoption area. 
3931	Maybe their is a student who would love to become involved with children or seniors, they may sign-up to help out at a local church, daycare center, pre-k, or nursing home. 
3932	There are even ways for kids who would like to be a part of the entertaining world to get involved! 
3933	Students can get involved in their community in countless ways weather its piking up trash or reading books to a small child, there are only 3 steps to community service... 
3934	"""Ugh, I wish that I could just stay home and attend my classes online without having to leave home,"" I say to myself at least eight million times during the school day; taking a moment to think about it, I thought maybe this would be beneficial. Today we live in a society in which students attend classes on a daily basis, some who walk across the street to attend class, some who have at least an hour commute to attend class everyday, and some who take online courses, which is very beneficial "
3935	it is an easier and more convenient option 
3936	some students may be unable to attend class due to an illness or disability. 
3937	First and foremost, students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because this option is easier and much more convenient for students 
3938	For instance, my mom was very busy at home caring for my sisters and at the time, there was no way she would have been able to attend any sort of class, therefore, she found an online option for the University of Phoenix where she could earn a degree by completing an online course. Due to the fact that this option was an availability for her, she was able to earn her degree with the slightest of ease 
3939	Additionally, this convenience allowed her to still be able to care for my sisters and complete her online courses without the stress of attending the class in person. Undoubtedly, had she not had this easy and convenient option open to her, she would have never had the time to earn her degree 
3940	Another example of why attending online classes is easy and more convenient is when I was already late for class and then I got stuck in traffic on the way to my Spanish 3 class, resulting in me missing the entirety of the class. Had I been registered for the same class but online, I would have never missed the Spanish 3 final exam. For these reasons, online classes can be much easier, convenient, and beneficial when dealing with life's daily obstacles. 
3941	In most cases, online and video conferencing classes from home are beneficial to students because it enables a student who may be ill or disabled a chance to attend a class from their home, which may be a challenge for them if they were to attend it in person 
3942	For example, I have Lyme disease, which makes it difficult sometimes to attend class because I am always fatigue. With this in mind, I plan on taking a few online classes myself, and I am so glad that this option is offered for the school I want to attend, which is Virginia Tech. I will no longer have to worry about if I will have enough energy to get out of bed and make it to class or if my joint pain is just too much to bare because I have the benefit of being able to be within the comfort of my home and still attend class online. Certainly, had I not had this amazing, beneficial opportunity to attend class online, I would have not been able to attend class regularly, without it being somewhat challenging 
3943	Another example of why online and video conferencing classes are beneficial to a student with an illness or disability is illustrated the time my Generic_Name was in college and got an bad spinal and neck injury, allowing her to not be able to walk for months and having to be in a wheel chair. It was very difficult for her to attend her English, Psychology, and AB Calculus classes due to this disability. Her counselor recommended that she stayed home for a few months to recover and continue attending her very important classes via video conference while her professor was teaching. Ultimately, had she not reaped the benefits from attending her classes through video at home, it would have been an enormous task to make it to her classes on a daily basis. In conclusion, online and video conference classes are a huge advantage for students who have trouble attending their classes in person. 
3944	Some may disagree and say that online or video conferencing classes are not beneficial to students because they are not reliable enough to capture the actual environment of how a class my be like if a student were to attend it in person, resulting in an online student attendee not learning as much as a student who attends the same class in person 
3945	For instance, my friend Generic_Name took the same class that I did during the school year, however, she took the course online over the summer; the class was Economics and Personal Finance. When we both were tested on the material that we learned during the course, she scored higher than I did which shocked me. In conclusion, online classes have the same material and benefits just as much as an actual classroom has and does not hinder the knowledge gained for taking the class in either way. 
3946	Conclusively, it is important to understand that attending online or video conference classes from home are very beneficial to students because it is an extremely useful alternative to students. In the past, students never had the chance to benefit from this new, sophisticated way of learning through online or video conferencing and had to attend class in person because technology was not as advanced as it is today. In the future, technology will advance even more than it already has, making online courses even more beneficial, possibly resorting to only online teaching. Ultimately, students benefit substancially from attending classes via online or video conferencing and this option should always continue to remain an option for students that need the benefits that it has to offer. 
3947	Although some may think that online school or video conferencing would prevent students from acquiring important skills that one would get from daily interaction, some students would benefit from online school 
3948	because some kids may have more pressure to help out at home 
3949	many students have trouble focusing when around many other students. 
3950	 Starting off, there are plenty of students that are more relied on at home and taking online school would give them more time to assist at home. 
3951	For example, my friend lives in her apartment with her older sister who is diagnosed with cancer but still works almost everyday to provide for her family, her cousin who is mentally disabled and cannot work, and her mom who has a medical condition where she has trouble walking. My friend sometimes has to leave school early just to go to her job and works eight hour shifts, five days a week and stays up to do her homework or sometimes isn't able to complete it. Online school or video conferencing would save drastic amounts of time in order for her to be able to work more to provide for her family and be able to pay for online school and make meals for her family, while still getting her education. Overall, online school would be a better option for some students whose family situations may need a little more attention than others 
3952	Furthermore, some students may have a mental disorder that would prevent them from giving their full, undivided attention in the classroom. 
3953	For example, one of my friends is diagnosed with Attention-Deficit-Hyperactive Disorder(ADHD). She gets distracted very easily, especially in a classroom full of students. My friend getting distracted constantly by the noises of a student tapping their pencil, someone coughing, or simply the presence of many people in a classroom has a largely negative impact on her school performance. For her, distance school would get rid of a good amount of those distractions, and help her focus more on her schoolwork. Therefore, some students who have personal complications, and taking online school would boost their educational performance.  
3954	In conclusion, while many think that taking online school would have students lack social skills for their future job, online school would have a positive impact for students who need to help out more at home and for students that physically attending school would prevent them from their full potential. Unfortunately, attending school is not the best option for some students, and having the choice of online school should definitely be provided to students who would greatly benefit from it.             
3955	Richard Nixon, Jimmy carter, Bob Dole, and plenty of oothers think that it should change because according to a gallup poll in 2000 taken shortlyafer Al Gore he wonn the popular vote but lost the presidency dur to the quirks of the electoral college. in the Electoral College system people vote not for the prresident but for a slate of electors as i had said in the last pargrraph who in turn elect or the president. electors could be anyon not holding public office. voters sometimes control who there electors vote for. wich makes the voters sometimes get confsed about the electors wich makes them vote for the wrong candidate. In the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in the centery. in 1960 segegaters in Louisiana legslater nearly suceeddin replacing Democratic electora with new electors. So that the popular vote for Kennedy woulld not have actually gone to Kennedy. So them electors in the same vein they qould have to occasionally refuse to vote for the partys cannidate and cast a decideiing vote to who ever they please. 
3956	In education we always have a choice to choose rather we get our education at home or through public and private school but which one is the right choice ? Throughout this essay we will explore the pros and cons on which one is the more beneficial choice. Many kids in life go to public schools since the start of their education life but there are those that choose to get education at home. A child's personality also adds on to what the better choice might be for that certain individual. There are a lot of benefits and non-benefits to having a student attend classes from home. 
3957	it will have a negative effect on motivation, lack of support 
3958	prevent a student from learning valuable lessons in life 
3959	Many students in attending classes from home will face not being motivated to get their work done and also face a lack of support through difficult learning periods. Having classes at home would make being motivated to learn much harder than attending classes in school 
3960	We all at one point no longer want to continue trying to grasp how important it is to learn and be educated but with support from teachers and others we find it more insuring to continue learning and broaden our education. Learning certain lessons that are hard to comprehend without support is a difficult task. Students at home would be prone to more likely give up and not try as hard to understand the material. Unlike a student in a classroom with peers around that can help and that extra assistance of a teacher there to explain. Everyone needs that extra push in difficult times with classes at home there would be no one to constantly keep us on task and help us learn. The lack of motivation and support that is much needed are reasons on why classes from home are not beneficial to students. 
3961	People will argue that some benefits of attending classes from home is better by stating that it prevents students from being bullied and gives students a better environment. 
3962	Kids of all age face the chance of being bullied in their education years. There will be a chance of a student being pulled regardless of the learning environment. At home away from others may seem like it will prevent bullying but it won't. Through social media kids can be targeted and parents may not always know that this is happening because kids won't know what to do 
3963	Attending classes in school will teach students important lessons on what to do in these cases. They make students aware of bullying that can either happen in school or online and give them lessons on what to do and seek help. With classes at home kids will not know what to do and stay quiet thinking that there is no way out of a bullying situation. 
3964	A good environment is always wanted for a child who is getting their education but an environment at home even though it looks beneficial may not always be the case. Having a student attend classes at home takes their chances of learning social skills that are gained through public schools and interactions. Through classes in schools students learn to work with others and gain skills that will help in the future with co-workers and everyday life. Classes at home make an oppressive environment where a student doesn't gain these skills which in the end will effect how well they can interact with others in society. In the end, attending classes in school is much better than online because of how it helps with bullying and teaches student important social skills. 
3965	Finally attending classes at home keeps a student from developing their identities and learning more about themselves 
3966	In life we always struggle to learn new things about ourselves and broaden who we are. Through challenges students face in school and the friends they make better help them understand who they are and develop their identities. Interactions in schools, different friend groups, and learning about the world in classes with others help students shape their identities. Students learn new perspectives from others and get to choose whether to agree or disagree but with online classes we don't have all these opportunities that help students develop their identities and broaden who they are.  
3967	Attending classes in school gives students chances to better learn about themselves by providing classes in the arts, technology, cooking, management, and much more 
3968	These classes in different areas help students learn about who they are and gives them a chance to explore and also give them social skills. Online classes restricts a student from exploring and learning what they like or dislike to do which will have negative effects when they seek a career. Attending classes from home is not beneficial because it keeps a student from developing their identities and learning about themselves. 
3969	Students will face many hardships in life but through going to school and attending classes in school they will learn valuable lessons and learn about themselves. A student will face being unmotivated but with help support from peers and teachers they will get through those times. Online classes are not beneficial to a student because it prevents them from gaining social skills and makes it harder from them to go out in the world. Even though, it may seem like online classes will prevent bullying and be a better environment that is not the case. It will hurt the student more by them not knowing what to do in cases of being bullied and also keeping them in an oppressive environment away from others. Classes in school help shape a students identity, helps them learn about themselves, and the world. In conclusion, attending classes from home is not more beneficial because of the lack of motivation, lack of support, and how it doesn't help shape a students identity. What do you think is more beneficial for a student online classes or classes in school?          
3970	Have you seen our earth? It needs help 
3971	That's why i think you should make kids do community service! 
3972	It will make our earth cleaner 
3973	Well to start off, i think kids should do community service is because all kids do when they get home from school is watch television and play video games 
3974	but when they realize they are working together to help the community they should feel better about themselves 
3975	A couple examples to do outside would be to pick up trash or tutor someone. If you pick up trash, people might notice and they will stop throwing stuff out of there car window. They also might help pick up trash. If you help someone else they other person will benefit with a better education, that will be needed for a good job later in life, or the kids might be nice to other people since you were nice to them! You might want to do other things that i didn't mention, and that is fine! As long as you make it to were the kids at SCHOOL_NAME do community work, this planet will be looking good in no time! 
3976	If you do sports or something in that category then you could be recognized at the end of the season for volunteering outside of school. This could be useful if you want to do something and you have a good back ground! Getting recognized for helping out is a great way you could be a better person! TEACHER_NAME if you let children help out, it will be great for them! 
3977	In conclusion, I told you it would be a good thing for the kids so they are not at home watching television and playing video games all day! Then i also told you there are plenty of things to do outside for the environment! Finally i told you it would be good for kids to help out with the outside world, not just in school! I no it'll take time away from school, and we need our education but if you think about it kids may want to help out, some might just be to afraid to say something! 
3978	Electoral College should be abolished 
3979	because the electors may help ruin the president election 
3980	Many may not realize but when they vote they're not voting for the president, they're voting for state electors 
3981	"for example ""each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee"" although each party chooses a trusted elector many can betray the party and select the other party. Also the betray can cost the presdient election dearly for instance Bradford stated "" back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. kennedy.(So that a popular vote for kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy)"". In other words the electors can ruin the president campaign and may cost most of the states problems. "
3982	"Source 2 quoted "" Because of the -take- all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. Even though you would like to vote for your campaign the electors may not even visit other sates because they may think the other campaign has a better shot at getting more votes, but they do not know that maybe spoken words for the president may get more votes. also many may not even see any ad for the campaign, for example "" During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" The author explains that many electors don't even see most staes because they are small states and they may not get as much votes compared to larger states. "
3983	Electoral College should be abolished because the electors may help ruin the president election and large states are not vistied or spoken to from the president other than small states. Electoral college may seem an unfair disadvantage for most voters many of their campaign that they want to win can be rather at a disadvantage or advantage depending on their electors,  many electors may betray their campaign because they're not pubilicly held in office. Lastly the disadvantage is that many voters want to see what and how they are going to change or improve their well being, but most electors and campaigns do not visit the states that want view and know the candidates better. The electoral College should be abolished for the matter of the voter and the United States of America. In my opinion we should be allowed to vote on our own, for example instead of voting for an elector we should just vote on the type of campagin whose better and meet our daily bases needs.  
3984	I get that they have to monitor the votes but arnt we already using electronic computers to vote... I think voting would go alot smoother if the votes went strait to the presidents through computers instead of having an elector who has a strong personal opinion against one political party who has a chance of twisting the votes around to strongly support the political party that he/she is opinionized towards. This why the Electoral Collage is dangerous. There have been cases of law breaking electors twisting the votes around. It is alot more safe to just let the citizens to just strait up vote. 
3985	Online school is less beneficial to students education because there are more distractions at home than in a controlled classroom setting, 
3986	students do not have as much human interaction, hindering character development, 
3987	and students have limited resources which limits students knowledge and understanding of particualar topics.  
3988	Although some may argue that traditional classrooms are filled with distractions, home settings have even more distractions. 
3989	Classrooms are controlled settings where students are assigned specific tasks for a particular amount of time. Teachers and administrators also try to limit distractions for students by placing strict learning policies, such as, no phones during instruction. In my IB Business Management class, my teacher, Generic_Name, disgussed the advantages and the disadvantages of working from home. One major disadvantage of working from home was the increased level of distrations, which led to an ultimate decrease in productivity amongst workers. If adults are not able to implement online working from home efficiently and effectively, how can students? Students need the rigid structure that a classroom provides. The classroom setting helps aid in developing proper work ethics that students can use in their future careers. In sum, online school could lead to a decrease in student productivity rates, which further emphasizes why online education is not beneficial to students. 
3990	Human interation is vital to student character development. Although some may argue that students could increase their level of human interaction through increasing their extra ciricular activities, collaborating with other students on an acidemic level is far more beneficial to students. 
3991	Online schooling does not allow for students to think critically with one another. Instead, online schooling focuses on the thoughts of the student that is taking the class. This type of schooling could be detrimental to young students who grow up with this form of education. Online schooling does not allow for students to see other peoples viewpoints, it instead, teaches students that only their opinion matters; a mindset that is difficult to revert. Being singleminded in a workplace could make a person difficult to work with. Thus, decreasing the chances of maintaining a healthy job environment and relationship with co-workers. Furthermore, in a classroom setting, students interact with one another daily, teaching students the importance of communication while also building character. 
3992	however, online school does not give students the same hands-on-experience that the students in the classroom may recieve. 
3993	For example, if a student were to be taking an IB Chemistry course online, the student might only do simulation labs online instead of physically munipulating the chemicals in lab. Although simulations are a sufficient way to gain knowledge on a particular topic, hands-on training and experimentation, in the classroom, are far more effective ways for students to gain knowlegde and understanding of how different elements function 
3994	With online students not having the same resources that students in the classroom have access to, this puts the online learners at a disadvantage, which only furthers my argument that online school is less beneficial to students. 
3995	 Eventhough online school has a few advantages, ultimatelty the disadvantages including: increased distractions, little character development, and limited growth in knowledge becasue of lack of resources, out weighs the positives. Traditional classroom style teaching allows students to learn and grow both acidemically and also in their character development, whereas online school hinders acidemic and character growth within students. These traits are part of the foundation that makes a person, so with online schoool limiting those traits, it cannot be as beneficial as traditional classroom teaching is.  
3996	"In our society, technology is advancing significantly by the day. What was once a letter that took 10-day trip overseas to its appropriate destination is now just a simple text message that reaches a person within seconds. The automobile is an innovation that has also advanced dramatically, enough to the point where almost every person who can afford to have one does because of its necessity when transportation becomes a factor. The idea of a car becoming ""driverless"" is simply another boost in the technology available to cars today, as discussed in ""Driverless Cars are Coming."" "
3997	Due to its many benefits, driverless cars are a positive additon to our society.  
3998	Driverless cars offer a multitude of benefits for any passengers that might use them for transportation. 
3999	"For one, the necessity to have to buy or pay off a car would essentially cease to exist. If computer-operated vehicles were capable of driving in all areas, then what would the need for having your own car be? Even if the car wasn't ""fully automated"" and the driver would have to take over at some point, the less work you have to do, the more time you have to work on something else. The article addresses this topic ""Some manufacturers hope to do that by bringing in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays."" The biggest asset that the consumer gains from a driverless car is time, while still being transported in a safe and reliable vehicle. This reinforces the advantages available to consumers who use a driverless car.  "
4000	"Speaking of safety, there is not a vehicle more safe than one that is more or less ""automatic. "
4001	"With autmoated cars, drivers will be able to transport themselves without having to add the extra element of driving into a day that might be stressful. However, not all cars are fully capable to driving themselves yet without driver assistance. The good news? This innovation still grants a tremendous amount of safety to the driver in charge. The features previously cited as being used as tiem fillers can also be quickly changed to inform the driver that they need to take over: ""Such displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over."" An advantage to this approach is that if all communication and distractions from within the car is shut down, then the driver has no choice but to focus on the road, another argument for the push of driverless cars. "
4002	"The last topic at hand with these types of vehicles skims along the lines of controversial. Liability is a very integral part of the car industry, accidents will always be an issue, as cited by the article: ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer?"" Would smarter cars help this problem "
4003	In conclusion, driverless cars have brought about many new benefits in our society. From their ease of access to consumers to the top level of safety features that are sure to be made available in them, they will clearly become the top option of vehicle to use in our society once enough of them are made. This technological innovation is capable of doing many wonders in the automotive industry. 
4004	Imagine, the streets of Sparta,New Jersey clean as a whistle. well Lately some of my friends have been performing community service. They have been saying how important this was to our community. While my other friends said this was a huge waste of time and takes away from things they want to do 
4005	I believe that community service is the right thing to do 
4006	When a college goes to accept a child they don't just look at grades. They look at what extra curricular activities they do. Community service shows the colleges that the kids will help out society if they want. This is also an EXTRA curricular activity so they weren't forced to do this. They did it because they wanted to and that is a great way to look at a student. The kids will also be more likely to be accepted by higher ranked college. 
4007	The adults always get mad when the kids are skateboarding through the mall and are almost hitting people. If they do the community service the adults will like the kids more because they are helping out the community. The kids also look up to older kids. For example, if they see an older kid picking up garbage of the road or even just a brother they will want to be big like them and do the same thing as them. 
4008	The streets of some towns not just Sparta are not always clean. If the kids start to pick up the trash on the side of the road the streets will get cleaner. It could also effect those who through their trash out their car window. For example, they might say wow look what I'm making these kids do. I'm making them cleanup after me. This could get someone like that to stop throwing their trash out a window and start putting it in a trash can. It could also inspire them to help out or support the cleanup. 
4009	In conclusion, community cleanup is a good idea. For one it will look good on kids diploma for college. It will also make more respected by adults and children. Lastly it will help make roads and sidewalks clean to walk on and no flying debris. 
4010	I think you should make the community service an elective for the 8 grade students 
4011	I feel like we should keep the Electoral College 
4012	everyone will have to put ads up because not just one region of votes will make them president they are going to need to advertise everywhere. 
4013	"Also in ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the Presiden"" (Paragraph 22)take Richard Nixon's and Bill Clinton's presidental campaign. Those two only won 43% of their popular votes but they won their elections with the Electoral College. Without the Electoral College all three of these presides wouldn't have become President of the United States. "
4014	"Look at ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" Mitt Romney doesn't campaign in the South part of the United States since he knows that he is popular in that region with the electors he doesn't bother camapigning there since he knows he will win their votes. But he has to campaign to other states and regions since he knows the South doesn't have enough power to make him president. And with that comes your swing states and the big states. Swing states listen to what the presidental candidates have to say since they are toss-up states. These swing states literally can ""swing"" the election. These are the states that are going to decide who the next president is. And that ties in with your big states; California, Texas, Florida, New York, and Pennsylvania are some of your big states since they have the most population out of the United States. These states can also be swing states since they have the most votes out of every state. With the power of the popular vote a presidental canidate can become president, and other regions will not have a say. But using the Electoral College that can't happen. "
4015	"But some people don't really know what they are voting for in election which is why the Electoral College is the way to go. Also people complained with the ""winners take all method"" some candidates don't go to certain states and only focus on the swing states. In the 2000 campaign seventeen out of fifty states didn't see the candidates. But the candidates didn't go to those states since they knew they had no chance of winning those states and they needed to focus on the swing states to make sure they win the election. Many people do call the Electoral College an anachronism, but it doesn't need to stick in the past, it needs to be kept in the present and in the future. "
4016	the United States needs to keep the Electoral College instead of the popular vote because you will always have an outcome and one region can't overpower another and make a candidate win the presidental campaign. Yes, as said before many people want to get rid of the Electoral College but it will stay with the United States and move forward with us people. 
4017	"Electoral votes are cast by electors chosen to represent each state, these electors are ""...trusted to vote for the party's nominee..."", stated Richard Posner. This means that electors are trusted and qualified to efficiently represent the vote their state desires "
4018	The policy of students not being able to participate in sports or other activities unless they have B average is a praiseworthy one because it encourages students to soar academically. 
4019	First of all, those who desire to participate in extracurricular activities, which is a large portion of students, will be forced to try their hardest in school.  
4020	Putting one-hundred percent of their efforts into academic-related activities, such as studying for exams, doing their homework, etcetera, will help students in the long run.  They will get better grades, go to better colleges, get better jobs, and ultimately live better lives. This policy encourages this needed hard work in school, thus, is a commendable one. 
4021	Second of all, students will better grasp the concept of responsibility. 
4022	If schools support this idea of having the responsibility of getting good grades, then students will improve academically and intellectually.  
4023	While many may argue for it, the Electoral College has proved to be an obselete way of electing the President. 
4024	It is, essentially, an indirect way for voters to choose their candidates, by voting for electors whose loyalty is not guaranteed. 
4025	The Electoral College vote can override the popular vote, as seen in the 2000 Presidential Election. 
4026	Some say that the Electoral College is a system worth keeping, because it provides a certain outcome and avoids run-off elections, 
4027	Undoubtedly outdated, this system is a catastrophe in the works, 
4028	the 2000 election only a glimpse of the chaos that could result from the Electoral College. The disaster factor is a strong argument against the Electoral College. Consider 1960, when Louisiana segregationists came close to replacing Democratic electors with ones who wouldn't support Kennedy (11). Also along those lines, electors are bound by nothing but obligation to vote for the candidate of their party, and sometimes change their decision upon voting. Even if it only happens occassionally, it is yet another fault in this system. 
4029	Not only is the Electoral College irrational, it is also simply unfair. 
4030	Each state can only cast a single vote, so the one representative in Wyoming, who represents only 500 thousand, would have as much say as California's 55 representatives, who represent 35 million voters (12). 
4031	Other sources say a tie would be unlikely. 
4032	However, in 1979 in Ohio, it would have only taken a few thousand voters to vote the other way (12). 
4033	"Because of the ""winner-take-all"" system, certain states are left untouched by candidates who know they won't win them. In 2000, certain states didn't even see the candidates, and didn't air campaign ads, denying voters of a chance to further favor or unfavor them (13). "
4034	It is simple, the Electoral College system is a turn-off for many voters, especially after the incident in 2000 when Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the electoral vote. 
4035	Voters can be discouraged if they have no hope of carrying their state, like Democrats in Texas, or Republicans in Cali (23). 
4036	"Assuming that ""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election (23)"" "
4037	is rather incorrect. Single votes could absolutely sway an election, as mentioned earlier. 
4038	Relying on the popular vote may make a tie more likely, 
4039	but it would free voters from an obselete and untrustworthy system. Over 60 percent of voters oppose the Electoral College (9) which is enough to bring attention to these facts and, hopefully, address them before another controversial occurance. 
4040	The evidence is all layed out, mishaps and near-mishaps, an impending catastrophe all too possible for comfort, unfair to potential voters. The Electoral College doesn't deserve its defenders. 2000 proved it, the voters have spoken up, and it is indisputably irrational to continue to rely on it. The system has been around for a while, and it will stay in place for the next few years, most likely. However, because of the light now being shined on its faults, it could have a chance to be reformed for the better.         
4041	Sports are a very important factor to many schools.  Many kids take sports for granted, and don't focus on their school work.  Our Principal is considering changing school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average. 
4042	Despite the fact that many students have a grade C or below average, this new policy would encourage students to do well in school so that they can participate in sports, 
4043	more students in the school would have grades of B's and even A's 
4044	the sports teams and activities would be smarter and more successful as a result.  
4045	Overall, a requirement of a B average to play sports would be beneficial to our school's community as a whole. 
4046	With a requirement of a B average to participate in extracurricular activities, more students would have the goal of achieving a B average.  As a result, less students would be failing their courses do to lack of effort or time.  With more students with a higher average, the school would look better in terms of grades.  Now that their is a requirement of a B average to participate in sports, music, or another activity, the school would have much smarter students.  As a result, these students would be sent to better colleges.  This would make the school less known for its bad things, but more well-known for its high academic prestige.  This requirement would be the most reasonable choice because less students would be failing courses.  
4047	The time has come to decide whether or not to make a requirement of a B average amongst students in order to participate in sports or other activities.  This requirement would be beneficial to our school's community because it would encourage students to do well in the classroom, more students would have a B or higher grade average, and the sports teams would be much smarter and more successful as a result.  So, Mr. Principal, go and make a requirement of a B or higher grade average in order to participate in sports or other activities! 
4048	There are millions of wrecks in the U.S. every year, some due to their own cars not being very reliable. Cars and their manufacurers must be very reliable when it comes to bringing up new models of vehicles. Imagine if you could cut the number of car wrecks in half. Technology is fast pacing and is advancing every day. What if we could have driverless cars, cars that could not only make the world a better place, but also prove how amazing our technology is. 
4049	Driverless cars are the next, new future. 
4050	Driverless cars have an abundant amount of pros and maybe a little bit of cons, but overall these cars can do great things. 
4051	A driverless car could possibly stop different aspects of accidents happening. They could even get someone where they need to go. These cars can also help people who barely passed their driver's tests. The car could perform even the most basic stuff, such as, driving through the city, making turns, driving the steering wheel itself, and watching for dangerous things a new or inexperienced driver could not do. Being a new driver can be very challening at first and may even bring a traumatic experience. Coming off as a new driver and only having my license for three months, I know what the pressure can feel like when you feel like you havent learned soemthing and you are already on your own. 
4052	There are some cons when it comes to new driverless cars; 
4053	Let's say someone is in a wreck and later come to find the car had failed them, who is responsible now? The manufacturer. The car could fail out of nowhere with no warning signs and even cost someone their life. Though there have been studies, a driverless car could have a potential downfall affect on drivers. Some could feel like they can be lazy and not have to worry about their surroundings and cause an accident that way; A person could even fall asleep at the wheel and do more damage than good. Some states make it illegal to even drive computer-type cars because of a law they have. 
4054	Driverless cars come with baggage on both sides of good and bad, but with a little more knowledge and research it could change someone's opinion overtime. They could potentially save someone's life and other people surrounding them. They could save a new driver's life and could even help them learn all of the skills of the road. With the new techonology we have in this new future, we could cut the wreck numbers in half to seventy five percent. Driverless cars are not a bad idea and they could possibly save this world. 
4055	The Electoral College is a process put into place by the founding fathers for the purpose of electing a president. However, this process was enacted at the very beginning of the United States and the question must be asked, Is it still neccessary? Or even fair? 
4056	Almost all states have a winner-take-all system in place, with the exception of Maine and Nebraska. This system has many faults and in some cases can produce false results. 
4057	A presidential candidate that wins by a large majority in a state will win the electoral votes of that state, however, if another candidate wins a very close election, he/she will also win a state. For example, in the 2000 presidential election between Al Gore and President Bush, Al Gore won the popular vote of the people but lost the election for president because of the electoral college, the very fact that we know what the popular vote was is proof of neccesity of change. Not only this, but sixty percent of voters want to vote directly. This makes it possible for a candidate to have more individual votes but less electoral votes, making the system somewhat corrupt. 
4058	Not only is the process of the Electoral College unfair, it is simply not neccessary, with most voters using digital machines to enter their vote for candidate, votes can be counted digitally and accurately. 
4059	The electoral college was a great idea before computers were invented and all votes had to be counted by hand. When the process of the Electoral College was put into place, it would have been impossible to count he votes of the entire country with any degree of accuracy, and even if it was possible, the validity of votes would be constantly be questioned. But in this day and age technology makes the very idea of the elctoral college obsolete. I understand the desire for preserving traditional methods but not when it sacrifices a fast, fair, easy system. 
4060	Not only should we use a system using computers to count votes, but we already do, news broadcasters show which presidential candidate is winning in real time using modern technology. 
4061	This allows us to know which candidate has won the election on voting day. Keep in mind that when the electoral college was made, many citizens had no idea who had won often until the next year. The fact that we know immediatly is proof that the meeting of the Electoral college in December is completely unnessessary. And what if there is a tie in the elctoral vote, although we know what the popular vote is, we would still have to send the vote to congress. 
4062	Times have changed. Technology has improved. With this the very building blocks of our government must be improved and updated. The Electoral College is a perfect example of a system that worked well in the early days of the country but has since been made obsolete, this system must be fixed 
4063	This letter is to inform you of the idea of requiring students to perform community service. Community service is a good was to show others how our school wants to help out in our community. 
4064	This can be fun 
4065	educational 
4066	a great way to have community service hours for the future, 
4067	a great way to give people an idea of how SCHOOL_NAME is a great school, and a way to teach and inspire others. 
4068	Students can have fun with their friends while doing something for others. It is also a great opportunity for us students to make new friends, or grow closer to our old friends. This would also be a good opportunity for us students, the faculty and the teachers to grow closer as a family. If ICS were to help out at a soup kitchen, it would be fun for all of us to work together and cook, clean, and make others happy. 
4069	Service hours are very helpful in the future. For example high schools, and colleges look at your community service hours and there is a greater percentage that you may get in that school. If they know that you are helpful to others, they would know that you would be helpful in their school. 
4070	If people see that SCHOOL_NAME students are helpful, and aware of the planet we live in, they would consider putting there child in our school. Not only would it make people consider this, but it would also leave a good reputation on our school and how it is run. 
4071	I believe that Driverless cars are going to be a very important nessesity to the development and transition of transportaion technology. Transportation will change from getting to places by using your own brain, to getting to places without having to really think about what you are doing while you are going somewhere. 
4072	I feel that diverless cars will not only help with safety of people while they are on the road, 
4073	benifit people by being able to get to places faster 
4074	get more things done in the day while driving to a destination. 
4075	This is becuase of all of the safety features that are equipted in driverless cars.  They contain a numerous amount of sensors and alert systems. If there was something that would harm you while in the driverless car, the car would either be able to get out of the situation more effectively than an experienced driver, or would be able to alert the driver to take over and the driver would manually get out of the situation.  In the passage it says that the Google driverless cars contain many sensors. Some of those sensors include, the sensor on the left rear wheel, a rotating sensor on the roof, a camera mounted near the rearview mirror, four automotive radar sensors, a GPS reciever, and an inertial motion sensor.  This shows first hand how safe the driverless cars are. The Driverless cars have so many built in sensors that even the most dangerous situation can be avoided while in a driverless car. 
4076	if everyone owns or uses a driverless car to get to the places it needs to go, then the car can program itself to get to the place that it needs to go as efficiently and in the best route possible. 
4077	if you use a driverless car to go to the places you need to go to in the day, you will be able to get a multitude of things done that you were not able to get done before. 
4078	I think that students should be do community serves, but not too much only. probably only like one hour or tow. 
4079	The Electoral College has been around since the Constitution was established by the founding fathers. The question is, Is it time for it to go? 
4080	I believe that the Electoral College should be kept, 
4081	the Electoral College is fair for the people.  
4082	"Source 3 states, ""In 2012's election... Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the  electoral vote compared to only 51.3% of the popular votes cast for him and Romney."" This source is arguing against the Electoral college, meaning they're trying to make a point on why it's not fair that Obama won with his 61.7 percent. The people vote for their electoral college, for their state. If the electoral college's votes are higher than the popular votes that means that the college is doing their job correctly. Source 3 also states, ""... Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral- vote victory in that state."" This statement means that even if the popular and electoral votes are both high, the electoral vote wins, because majority rules. Just because the person running for office is popular, doesnt mean they should necessarily win. Electoral votes basically come from the people, and if the ""people"" choose a certain candidate, then that's who should win.  "
4083	"Source 2 states, ""Under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" This method of choosing the president is completely and totally fair to the people. "
4084	No, they're not directly choosing who the president is 
4085	but they have people to do it for them. As long as they cast in the right vote for the party that that candidate represents, then the Electoral college board should be filled with all the right people. 
4086	Yes there is a possibility that the candidate someone votes for may not make it on the Electoral college board, 
4087	but if the majority of the people are represnted, then that's all that matters. 
4088	"Source 3 states, ""...each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee (and that truth is barely betrayed)... however it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote."" For instance, if the people vote for candidates for the electoral college, and the majority of them are not what the majority of the people wanted, or they lied about being pledged to a candidate for president, then there is still a chance that the candidate that the people did want could be elected, by the national popular vote. Also, the people that are against the electoral college shouldn't be, because the electoral college is not definite. Just because the electoral colleg votes for a certain candidate, does not guarantee that the overall national vote will be that person. "
4089	Eventhough some people think that the electoral college, should be no more, I strongly disagree, 
4090	because the college is fair to the people -because they represent the people- and the college is a smart idea. The college works in everyone's favor. For those that disagree, there is always a strong chance that the candidate represented by the elctoral college will not win presidency. 
4091	In conclusion, the Electoral college is beneficial to the people and a wise idea. The people in the entire country are never going to unanimously agree on anything. Keeping the Electoral college is not only wise, but a safe way to ensure that voting doesn't go wrong, and that the people  always get a fair say in government matters.                       
4092	Students are put into many different situations during their learning career. Many of these problems hinder their ability to obtain a proper student experience of learning. However, with the advancements we make with our technology, it appears that students can now have more opportunities to learn in a comfortable manner. 
4093	Online school is an innovative idea that makes it easier for students of all backgrounds and situations to learn with their peers without missing a beat 
4094	I believe with this option, it would support those who are ill and cannot physically go to school 
4095	it would give those who have moved to a foreign country an opportunity to learn in their own language 
4096	and it would put our educational technology to good use. 
4097	It is a very stressful situation for those students that have fallen ill to catch up to their peers. Missing out on a proper education due to something that could not be controlled is a very stressful situation in it of itself. There are parents that force their kids to go to school despite being sick, putting other students at risk of illness and not giving the sick student a proper learning experience. It gets even worse for those unfortunately inflicted with terminal illness, who must miss school for long periods at a time 
4098	However, parents would not have to worry about bringing their sick child to school, because school could bring itself to their sick child through a more flexible method of learning online. This could potentially help eliminate the problem of diseases spreading at schools that offer this option, and making it easier for students to learn despite their ill state. 
4099	Many students move to different places throughout their learning career, making it difficult for them to adapt to their new situations. It is tiresome for many to adjust to new circumstances that could vary drastically depending on where the move takes place. For instance, students that have parents in the military may face moving to different countries in their adolescence. It could also be very difficult for students that move internationally to understand the language or cultural differences that they are surrounded by 
4100	With online schooling and video conferencing, students will be able to be educated despite the hundreds of miles between them and their original school. This option may even help students take baby steps to slowly adjust to their new environment. 
4101	Science and technology are a constant effort that help us with our daily tasks, but, for some odd reason, we do not seem to utilize the extent of our genius when it comes to education 
4102	Online schooling is an affordable alternative to the concept of formal education. Some could argue that online schooling is only the beginning of a future with extremely accessible class education 
4103	We could see the implementation of virtual reality, or other new technology, in schooling systems in the near future. The more we encourage the use of this technology, the more we will see students prosper with a fulfilling education.  
4104	So that was and is my reasoning of why I think that the Electoral College should be removed from our political system. Between the being unfair to voters through voting for electors not even the president, reps not even being scaled right also the winner take all system making the system unbalanced, and the presidential candidates not even needing to appeal to most states just the swing states. I hope this passage convinces you that the Electoral College should be removed in place of a better system that is not out dated.                    
4105	I don't think it is fair to the students that play sports to have just an B average, i think it should be at least an C average because some students are better in some subjects than other students and by taking that away you are taking away all some kids know 
4106	Can you really trust a car to take you from point A to point B safely? There are many possible things that can go wrong while a person is not controlling their car. I think that there is not a safe way for a car to drive a person all by itself. If you don't know the next action that your car is going to take, how can you stop anything bad from happening? Will the car be able to determine where to stop if it is approaching a stop sign? 
4107	"There are too many ""what ifs"" with a driverless car for me to feel safe to ride in one, or to even have one driving on the street around me. "
4108	To me, there are a variety of things that can go wrong when you are allowing the car drive all by itself. There are too many questions that need to be answerd about these new cars. 
4109	 I think that driverless cars are a terrible idea. There are too many problems that can occur during the driving process, and I don't want my life in the hands of a car that can't see or think the way that a human does 
4110	If during some parts of the drive it requires a human to take the wheel, why have it automatically drive you? Wouldn't it get tiring waiting for your turn to drive, especially when you aren't sure when the car is going to have you take over? You must stay focused on the road and have both hands on the wheel, so you could very easliy just drive the car yourself without the worry. This way you can control the situations that you get into, and not having a car get you into trouble that you might not be able to get out of. I think that it is much more safe to have a human that can respond quickly to change and can manuver through obsticals than to have a car, that might not see everything in its environment, drive automatically through it. 
4111	As Christians, we are called to administer to the needs of the poor, but if this school is not pushing for it than how are we fulfilling our duties as Christians?  Whether it's working in soup kitchens downtown or helping babysit a neighbor, we should be striving to answer our call from God. 
4112	It is unfair to all the other students that were one point off from a B point average or those who didn't get those A' s or B' s. 
4113	It will make all the other students fell left out, or feel like they're being excluded. 
4114	"""Don't exclude, you should always include."" This is what teachers have told my fellow students and I for years. I think it is unfair to not let everyone compete in sports. These students that didn't get A' s or B' s may be the people who always wanted to compete in sports, but never had thought to join or never had the guts to stand up and join the teams, but if you introduce this new rule, then they don't even get a chance to try. I think this new rule is unfair and it shouldn't be kept. "
4115	not everyone is perfect in school, and not everyone gets all A' s and B' s. 
4116	sports provide any student with what they always need, confidence and exercise. 
4117	If you let a student's grade decide if a student can or can't compete in sports, you can be holding them back from healthy exercise and keep them from building confidence. Exercise keeps students healthy and when a student competes in sports, they are exercising. Every gym teacher I've ever had has always told us how daily exercise is important and I've seen many commercials that say growing kids and teens need at least one hour of exercise each day to keep physically fit and healthy. Sports also build confidence. When a team wins, it boosts a person's confidence. When you are confident, you feel that you can do anything and succeed. Sports provide healthy exercise and confidence to students, but if you keep this rule, you'll be depriving it from us. 
4118	Do you want to exclude students and make them feel like they're not good enough to participate in sports? Do you want to deprive us from healthy exercise and confidence? Please consider the consequences of keeping this new rule. I feel it is unfair and I strongly disagree with it. I don't want anyone to feel left out or worthless when it comes to sports, but do you? 
4119	Whats up with the electoral college? Can we really trust it? Ofcourse you cant and all that apose can stand up and walk out the door .The presidental race is a fake!!! So the goverment wants to tell you that you need to be a citezen to vote but what are you voting for? 
4120	I belive we should get to actually vote for the next presdent 
4121	Senator, we should keep the Electoral College. The Electoral College establishes judgement and fairness by giving upcoming presidents a fair shot. People have voices and the popular vote can be biased from state to state. 
4122	Along with the growing influence of technology in society comes the availability to use it to transform the way in which students are educated. With the use of technology, students could be given the responsibility and freedom to complete classes online rather than having to come into school five times a week. However, not all students have the focus and determination like others to be able to hold themselves accountable for completing their classes at home without a physical instructor. 
4123	I think students would benefit from being able to take online classes at home, rather than at school, 
4124	it would give students the opportunity to learn at their own appropriate pace 
4125	it would provide a more comfortable learning environment with less distractions.  
4126	While in the classroom, it is difficult for teachers to go at a pace that isn't too slow or too fast for every single student since not every student learns at the same pace. I consider myself a relatively slow learner and writer. Therefore, there have been several instances where my teachers would be lecturing and giving notes, and I found myself missing key information because the teacher was not allowing time for us to write it down. However, unlike my other teachers, my history teacher will make us take notes at home. In this instance, taking notes and learning from home, helped me retain and learn the information better than if I were at school because I was not constantly stressing about the teacher switching the slides, and therefore, potentially missing key concepts. Giving students the opportunity to learn from home allows students to make sure they get all of the necessary information that they may need for later success on a test. It also gives students time to be able to make sure that they understand the information on the notes, rather than just typing or writing it down without understanding the meaning behind it. In addition, some of my teachers make assignments due at the end of class, despite some students, like myself, not being able to finish within the time constraint 
4127	Therefore, I think learning from home provides the best learning environment for every student to do well in their education, since they don't have to constantly be overshadowed with the stress of time on important assignments. At home, students are able to ensure that they turn in quality work that will help improve their grades rather than hurt it because of a time constraint. Students should be given the opportunity to take classes from home because not every student learns identically and as quickly as others. 
4128	In the event that students would be able to take classes from home, they would also be able to learn in an environment that ensures their greatest focus and success. 
4129	To avoid instances like this, students should be able to learn at home where they can sit in a room all by themselves, free from any outside noises or distractions that may hinder their learning 
4130	Other students, and sometimes teachers, are simply just added distractions that make it even more difficult for students to focus on learning the information that the teacher is trying to teach to the class 
4131	Similarly, while in my AP Chemistry class, since I am usually one of the last students to finish the test, there is always a constant moving of students and whispering among the inconsiderate students who cause me to lose focus. It is very challenging for students to concentrate on their thoughts when they are followed by constant whispering and movement going on in the classroom. These distraction may cause students to either get the question wrong or run out of time, therefore, hurting their education 
4132	Furthermore, I constantly find myself being more focused doing my homework rather than trying to do my work in school because I am given an appropriate and quiet learning space that helps me concentrate on what I am doing. Allowing students to learn from the comfort of their home helps minimize the many potential distractions from other students and teachers that only cause problems with the student's concentration. 
4133	Many high school and college classes have leaned greatly towards using technology for student's to complete and turn in assignments. Nowadays, teachers and professors are mostly used for lecturing which can easily be transmitted online. Therefore, as the years progress, and technology grows to be more influential on society, schools should consider taking advantage of technology to ensure a better educational system for every type of student.   
4134	After reviewing information about the Electoral College, I believe that the Electoral College should not be used in deciding or electing the president of the United States. 
4135	"""Under the Electoral College system, voters vote not for President, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the President."" The sitation before states that it is not the President the voters are voting for, it is actually the electors that the people are voting for, who in turn will vote for the President. This situation does not allow for the people to directly vote for who they believe will be the best President. "
4136	It is really in the hands of the electors who will become President. 
4137	Secondly, after realizing that the number of electoral votes decides if you beome President or not, the Presidential candidates are going to want to focus on obtaining the most votes as possible. 
4138	"After determining which states they ""have in the bag"", the candidates are going to put their campaigning efforts toward the ""toss-up"" or ""swing states"". Here they will have to compete in a tight race between the other party to sway the voters of the state to vote their way. This method of campaigning in the swing states doesn't allow for much campaining in the big, numerous votes states. An example of this would be that during the 2000 campaign, almost 20 states did not see the candidates at all as well as campaign ads. With the Electoral College system in place, Presidential candidates are focusing more on obatianing the ""swing state"" votes and not so much on supporting and visiting the states and people they know they have.  "
4139	Finally, the system of electing electors who then vote for the President can be considered unpredictable. 
4140	"This being because the electors could at any time defy the will of the people. These shady electors, also known as ""faithless electors"", can deny to vote for their party's candidate and instead cast the vote for whomever they desire. This shows that it is not the people's choice, instead the choice of the elector. Also, the state legislatures are responsible for choosing the electors. This could cause an issue where the state legislatures are choosing electors who will vote for their party. Let's take it back to the 1960's where an example of this corruption almost took place. Segrigationists, or people who favored racial seperation, who were state legislatures in the state of Louisiana nearly suceeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would not vote for John F. Kennedy. This would've caused the popular vote to go to Kennedy's opponent. For the many reasons listed above, the Electoral College could be considered unpredictable and in some cases... shady. "
4141	"Overall Mr. Senator, I believe that the Electoral College should not be used to determine who becomes the President of the United States instead they should use popular vote. This being because the people are not directly voting, the candidates are just focusing on getting the votes and not on the people. And lastly because it can be considered unpredictable with the ""faithless electors"" and bais state legislatures. "
4142	I vote yes that we should keep the electoral college in. 
4143	Its easy to do because you don't have to count  them up yourself. 
4144	#1 fact there is a certainty of outcome by that i mean it show the popular votes. In 2012 Obama received 61.7% vote and Romney popualr vote was 51.3%.#2 is he/she have to be everybody president. He/she can't play sides like her cant just do the most for the south havt to be fair fot all of them.#3 swing states by sayig that the winner-take-all. So whoever win they take it all the awarding and everything else.#4 big states with big states the elsctoral collegethe balance all it out by the popualr votes. So it compare as a small states so u bout say its even. Last #5 it can stop and avoid run-offs when Nixon and Clinton was running it was a tied at 43%. 
4145	The students will find a way to bring there phones to school and use them while the teachers are not looking. Most of the students are already doing it, why you think putting a new policy is going to help the school it really is not, but by letting the students bring there phones in school and giving them time to use them is going to let the students know that the school trusts them, that the school doesn't think of them as children but as young and responsible adults 
4146	As far as the new policy goes I disagree because i feel everybody should be able to participate in activities 
4147	I think that you should think of allowing students to bring phones to school and let them use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time. 
4148	First of all, if students have cell phones then they will be tempted to use it and might get in trouble if they use it in class secretly because they are not allowed to use them in school 
4149	. Lets say that students are in class and they feel the urge to text because they have not used the phone that day. They will want to use it in class but they will do it secretly so the teacher wont take it away. For example there was this kid in my class and while we were in the middle of the lesson he would take out the phone while the teacher had her back to us and start using it. If you put the policy that will let us use our cell phones in school during lunch periods and free time then we will have enough texting done so that we will not need to text anymore until school is finished or until their next free time. 
4150	Second of all, if we were able to use our phones in lunch periods or free times then what will be the point of students getting in trouble all the time because of cell phones. 
4151	Just think about it, if students aren't able to use their phones in school at all then they will use it no matter what the case is because they feel the urge to do it. They will feel the need to do it because either they receive text that will make them want to reply back or they become so obsessed with using them that they think that they have to use it. 
4152	Lastly, you wont have teachers complaining about their students not paying attention in class due to the fact that the students are always on their cell phones. Most teachers have to stop the lesson because they have to waste their time taking students cell phones away. 
4153	If you put the policy that students can use their phones at free times and lunch periods then teachers wont be interrupted anymore and will just have to worry about teaching the students about what they have to learn to pass to the next grade. 
4154	Finally, that is why it would be a great idea to put the policy that will let the students use their cell phones at free times and lunch periods. 
4155	What doesn't make any sense to me is that the voters are not voting for the president but are voting for a slate of electors. 
4156	For example , we need to forces on more important things such as school work and maybe after school activates. I think we shouldn't be able to have our phones because 50% of students that have cell phones fail there classes because while the teacher is explaining something important the student us either messing around or texting another student which is not only affecting he/she but others around them. 
4157	There is no doubt that cell phones are very important to our every day lives. They allow people to get in contact with each other in just the click of a button. But they can also cause problems, not just at home, but in school too. 
4158	They are a distraction to students, 
4159	can cause serious problems such as rumors and gossip. 
4160	If cell phones were allowed during classes, instead of only during lunch periods and other free times, they would be put to use constantly. Students would be able to communicate through text message throughout the classroom, and the teacher would never know. If a student had an Internet connection on his/her phone, they would be able to play games, go on websites that are not allowed in school, and so on. This would all take place right under the teacher's nose, but they would have no way of knowing what was going on. This could be a serious problem for a student's education too. Since cell phones are such a distraction, Students could miss important lessons taught that day, and may fall behind. 
4161	Imagine a student doing his work, and suddenly he doesn't know the answer to a problem. Fortunately, he has his cell phone in his pocket, and can look up the answer on the internet. If cell phones are allowed during class, students can easily get information of the web, without doing to work nessacery.  During tests, students can send messages back and forth on what the answers are, and the teacher would never know. This is a problem, because students who are caught cheating can end up in serious trouble. 
4162	Cell phones can come to use once in a while; if you need to contact a parent or guardian, or if there is an emergency, your able to call some one right away. 
4163	If there was an emergency, isn't that what the school phone in the office is for? If students really needed to call someone, they can simply get a pass and go down to the office to use their phone. 
4164	"Rumors can ruin a persons reputation, that's a known fact. High school students and even middle school students love to talk. If cell phones were allowed, rumors would fly around the school. In a matter of minutes, everyone would know the latest gossip, just by one person pressing the ""Send to all"" button. This can lead to bullying, which could also lead to a flaw in that student's education. So no matter what, cell phones are a disadvantage to a school. "
4165	As you can see, their are many more cons then there are pros for cell phones allowed during class. Policy 2 is the right choice because it allows students to get in touch with whoever they need to contact, It can keep a student from cheating and save them the trouble that comes along with it, and it is also a way to slow down rumors, and a save a child's reputation. All just by removing cell phones from school. 
4166	It shouldn't be a priority for students to help. It should be a decided thing whether the student wants to or not. Kids all want to have fun and most students don't want to spend their time doing community service. So why make them? Let kids have fun, let kids decide whether or not they want to do community service. Its the right thing to do. 
4167	Making it a priority for students to do community service can mess up students education. 
4168	If the principle made students have a class for community service could you imagine the lack of education the kids can be getting. What about the lack of physical education? What if doing community service took up physical education classes?, How do you think your students would feel? Them not being able to run around and hang out will make them furious if id didn't have physical education I'd be angry too! 
4169	Yes, i know community service is something to better build your character, 
4170	So do you rather, making it a priority for your students to do community service or not? Do you rather them miss out on part of their education just to clean a field or to read to little children? Isn't that why we have teachers? Or do you want your students to be mad at their principle because there's not time to hang out or get all their energy out? Take it from me a student myself, you should let students have time to hang out its the best thing for kids our age. Making kids do community service may take that time up. Don't make it a priority for community service! Community service is not that big a deal! 
4171	I am writing you in concern of the new policy which you have been considering with the school board. In case you have forgotten, and I mean so in the utmost respect, it is just that people have a tendency to forget things, the new policy which has been suggested is to change school policy so that students are not allowed to participate in sports or other activities unless they have a B grade average. 
4172	In my opinion, this change is immensely unfair to the student body, will cause disarray among the different clubs, and will hurt the school much more than it will aid the school. My understanding is that you are considering this policy change so that students will work harder to retain a B average and so the student body will improve, however, you must also consider the numerous possible negative consequences. 
4173	First however, I believe some background knowledge is required. As you know already, a C grade average is considered average in most of our country, where as a B or an A average are considered above average, and outstanding, respectively. Also, as you may know already, most of the student body retains a C average. Your change in school policy would mean that everybody who is currently participating in school activities would be kicked out of them until new term grades come in at which point they may only hope that they did well enough to continue their sport. Our competitive would all fail do to the almost complete rooting of the students. Now this may only last a term, but who knows how long it might take to raise your grade average by a whole letter? You obviously went to school when you were a child, and I assume you enjoyed the extra curricular clubs which your school had to offer. Now imagine this. Imagine that you learned that you had to maintain an A or B average to continue in these sports. Now this was one of the years where you didn't do so well, and therefore got a C average. Wouldn't such a thing be detrimental to you? It would cause you to be kicked out of every activity which you participated in unless you managed to raise your grade! That is one the main points I am putting forth. 
4174	Such a change is not fair to the student body because the student body usually only maintains a C average! 
4175	people's grades are not always constant. 
4176	A student may get straight As one term but in the next term may get straight Cs. That would mean the activities would have an inconsistent flow of students for every term. The students who had improved their average would join their respective clubs but the students who had not would be forced to withdraw from their activities. The sports teams would fail because every player they got with the new term would not be as practised as the ones which they had from the old term. And what if their all-star line-up could not retain the necessary grade point average? Then victory for our sports teams would almost be impossible. I do not doubt the skills of the students within our school, but skill given and skill learned are to different things to consider. A person who is not great at basketball but who goes to every practice and tries as hard as he can at home might as well match a natural-born super star at basketball who doesn't practice due to arrogance. Which also brings me back to how such a change would be unfair.  
4177	And this change might cause them to much stress to be able to improve. 
4178	Students would easily find themselves in depression when they are unable to retain the correct grade average and such a thing would never be good for a school. Also people would have to deal with the stress of knowing that if they do not do well enough in school, they will not be able to participate in the things which they love. Such a thing is almost the same as bribing students to do well in school. Because they do well enough they're allowed to play a sport or join a club but if they don't they cannot do anything extra-curricular. 
4179	"this would thoroughly disorganise after-school help due to the fact that after-school help falls under the category an ""other activity."" Students who needed help would not be able to get it through conventional methods within school. "
4180	And what about the special education children or the less intelligent students who struggle just to pass? What about the people who can only get a C if they try their hardest? They would find themselves isolated, neither able to do well in school, nor able to do well in sports or other activities because they wouldn't be allowed to participate in them. Though I may be talking extremes, such a thing would be likely to increase the possibility that one of those misfortunate students would commit suicide! And a life is a life no matter how that person does in academics. 
4181	Certainly you cannot think that such a change would be a good thing for the school! All it would bring is chaos and stress and the amount of people who improve would also find themselves always under pressure, always struggling to be above average. There are various things that could go wrong under such a monumental change. It would certainly be unfair to the students, the activities would be very disorganized (some of them might even be forced to close due to lack of participants), and it would be unhealthy for all your students. 
4182	Driverless cars are another one of the world's technological marvels, that not only take away the prevalent nuisance of driving for long periods of time, but in terms of safety and efficiency, prevail. 
4183	When flexibility increases, 
4184	prices decrease 
4185	the safety of consumers is protected, 
4186	. Not only that, but Brin continues to state that the flexibility is increased as well, surpassing that of a bus. 
4187	Safety is also increased as a result of these vehicles. 
4188	"The fact that these vehicles are semi-autonomous and not completely autonomous enables a human driver to take control whenever they deem it necessary to do so. For example, Google's semi-autonomous creations are ""not truly driverless; they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways and when other complicated traffic issues arise.""  Sensors are what enable these vehicles to perform the tasks that astonish many to this day. Due to the fact that sensors have been used since the 1980s, vast improvements and tests have been conducted over the years to ensure that the safety of the consumer and those around he/she are preserved. The article even states that ""Within 10 years, those sensors [from the 1980s] had become more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers."" These vehicles allow for the potential decrease in drunk driving, which further emphasizes that safety is not only preserved with semi-autonomous cars, but is heavily increased.  "
4189	The fact that so many automobile companies, such as Tesla, BMW, Nissan, Mercedes-Benz, and Audi, are striving to integrate the idea of semi-autonomous vehicles into their production vehicles, provides even further assurance that the benefits undoubtedly outweigh the harms. Furthermore, this article explicitly states that, as a nation based on progression and safety, semi-autonomous vehicles are the means of achieving the road to a truly autonomous car, and a road to a dramatic increase in safety.        
4190	I think students who have less than a B average should be able to do sports, because doing sports teaches us students responsibility, and self discipline 
4191	"When election day comes and you finally drop your vote in the ballet box after waiting in line for the past hour, you walk away knowing that you have helped the candidate of your choice to rise to the top of the voting pole. Oh how wrong you are. The United States works on a voting system called the Electoral College. ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" "
4192	"This system has stood the test of time, however it has masked its flaws for long enough. ""60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" (Plumer 9). The people have spoken, "
4193	"In order to understand the flaws in the electoral college, you need to know what the electoral college is, and how it came to be. ""The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress."" (Office of the Federal Register 2). This system was created by the founding fathers as a compromise between the congressional vote and the popular vote. However there was a reason for this new, seperated voting system. During their time the founding fathers where among the most educated men in the country. Back then education was not standard and very few people could read or write. The founding fathers did not want uneducated citizens voting on the individual who would lead the country. So they created a system where the uneducated would vote for a group of educated men, who would in turn vote on a president. Thus the electoral college was born. "
4194	The founding fathers reasons for forging this system where justified in their day and age. However the world has changed since then. 
4195	Another large issue with the electoral college is its favoritism towards larger states. The United States was founded on federalism and democracy, giving power to the people instead of an over-arching central government ruling everything. So any policy that goes against our right to equal say in politics ought to be abbolished, right? 
4196	"The number of electors per state under the Electoral College is determined by the number of representatives the state has in congress. ""... one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your senators..."" (Office of the Federal Register 3). Since this system is based on population, bigger states get a emense priority over smaller states. ""The popular vote was very close in Florida [in 2012]; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote , got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes."" (Posner 21). This means that presidential candidates are going to focus on appealing to larger swing states that have more electoral votes, rather than smaller ones who only provide a few votes. That is not fair now is it? No matter how small a state may be its population still consists of United States' citizens, and they deserve just as much say as a bigger state. After all, that is the concept our country was founded on, equality and freedom. "
4197	If the Electoral College does not seem like a flawed system now, allow me to open your eyes to one last variable in our little Electoral equation. The disaster factor. The disaster factor deals with the will of the people, and them doing anything to get what they want. 
4198	"""Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that the popular vote for Kennedy would not actually gone to Kennedy.)"" (Plumer 11). That kind of scenario could completely change a close call to a landslide victory! The 1960 election is not the only case of this either. It happened again when Hawaii sent two slates of electors to congress, and in other various cases electors did not vote for their designated candidate. Finally there is the case of the 2000 election, where Al Gore won the popular vote, but lost the Electoral College! If just one person decides to go against the grain, everything gets thrown off. "
4199	Case and point, the Electoral College is a flawed system. People are educated and can make a smart choice for a president, everyone deserves fair say in the political world, and people need to open their eyes to the corruption that the Electoral College allows for. It may have made sense back in the day of the founding fathers, but it is time to move on and adopt the popular vote system that the people have asked for.    
4200	By , not making their vote count some people can feel that their voices are not being heard which can lead to in some cases riots and rebellions etc. Voting happens for a reason if gives the world a chance to pick whom they want to see lead them and who they feel like is the right person but in the end if there votes cant count and actually go to the electors limits their power and freedom to speak. '' Voters in presidential elections ae people who want to express a political prefeence rather than people ho think that a single vote may decide an election''.(source 3 , p.23). The Electoral College may have worked in the past but now its not working as well. 
4201	"The Electoral College has served us for more than a century in determining our nation's new president. ""The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress,"" states the article ""What Is the Electoral College?"" written by the Office of the Federal Register. This means that we do not vote directly vote for our new president, but instead vote for electors that vote for a candidate running for office. Though many individuals are in favor of keeping the Electoral College, if kept, it will continue to cause problems in our nation. "
4202	Our presidential campaign will be much better if we change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. 
4203	To begin with, the Electoral College is the cause for many issues in our nation's presidential campaign. First of all, voters sometimes cannot even control whom their electors vote for. Ergo, one may vote for an elector of our favorite candidate's party, however, we don't know if that elector will go back on his word and vote for another cadidate. 
4204	"The article ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" written by Bradford Plumer states, ""The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor. The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the sytem allows for much worse. Consider that state legislators are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people"". This means that the people never know if their electors are going to go back on their word and vote for another candidate. "
4205	Aside from that, their is the worrying aspect of a tie occurring. 
4206	"If that were to happen, then the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives. The article The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" written by Bradford Plumer states, ""In 1968, a shift of just 41, 971 votes would have deadlocked the election; In 1976, a tie would have occurred if a mere 5,559 votes in Ohio and 3,687 votes in Hawaii had voted the other way"". This says that if those people had just voted for the opposite person, then there would have been a tie between the two candidates. Yes, those numbers seem large, but in comparison to the number of voters that there were in those years, they're a small fraction of them. This shows how close elections are with the Electoral College. "
4207	"The article, ""What Is the Electoral College?"" written by the Office of the Federal Register states, ""Most states have a 'winner-take-all' system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate"". That is not fair to other voters who don't vote for the popular candidate in their state; they don't receive any electors. Additionally, most candidates only advertise and visit ""swing"" states. ""Swing"" states are the states that usually determine the outcome of the election. ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" written by Bradford Plumer says, ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad"". It's unjustifiable that simply because you have fewer electors in your state, you don't get to watch your candidates campaign. As previously mentioned, each state has a different number of electoral votes. It all depends on the population. For example, Texas, with a huge population has 38 electors, while Maine only has 4. The article, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid out defenses of the system are wrong"" states, ""Beacuse each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters"". Why do some states have more representatives than others just because of their population? It's not fair to the smaller states. It is true that the bigger states have more people in them, needing more representation, however, the smaller states have as much to say as the big ones. ' "
4208	"To conclude, the Electoral College has caused many disastorous factors in our presidential campaigns. It has caused the wrong president to be elected, and it doesn't give our citizens much of a voice in the election. However, changing the system to popular vote for the president will give people a louder voice in this nation and it will show them that the government cares about their opinion. As the article, ""The Indefesible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid out defenses are wrong"" written by Bradford Plumer states, ""It's officual: The Electoral College is unfaor, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguents against direct elections are spurious at best. "
4209	Online or video conferencing is seen by schools as an option for students to attend classes from home. I Think students would not benefit from attending class at home than they would attending classes at schools. Students would lose the opportunity to communicate with the teachers and other students about the topics they are learning about. Online classes don't keep up with what the student has learned and what the student needs help with 
4210	they would not be able to communicate and ask questions 
4211	students would lose the option of extracurricular activities and to socialize with other students.  
4212	Online classes are not a good option for students because they cannot communicate and ask questions that could benefit their learning 
4213	For example if the classes were not prerecorded or all written down and you had to listen to a teacher talk online, if you miss any information you wouldn't be able to communicate directly to the teacher for some time and wouldn't be able to ask questions until after the lesson. If the class was thought through notes online then students would't be able to communicate with the teacher directly and would have to email them which would take time for them to respond. Students need to think about the information they are learning and not asking questions and making connections, could hurt students when they are taking a test.  
4214	Online distance learning also takes away the option for students to socialize with other students and to attend or take extracurricular activities after school that they would normally take if they were at school. 
4215	Students would not be able to work on any assignments or share any information with other students and would have to work alone. Students would not be able to join school sports, to be part of a team or to just be a little active instead of staying in your house all day, or attend other after school activities that would allow students to socialize and learn about more information that other schools provide after school. Students would lose the opportunity to stay after school with the teacher and ask questions and ask for help. 
4216	 Online distance learning would not benefit students because it takes away the option of direct communication which is key when it comes to learning new curricular. The chance of cheating and laziness increase with taking online classes because its based on your schedule and you learn from your own computer. Also it takes away from socializing with other students and making new friends to spend time with and also losing the option to try after school activities. Also students could have many issues accessing the lessons which would ultimately disrupt their learning. Some schools may offer the option to attend classes while at home but students wouldn't benefit as much as attending classes at school.         
4217	The electoral college seems to have worked for all these years , but my opinion on this is that we should change it to electing a president with popular vote. There are many pros and cons to both the electoral college and the popular vote but the positives of the popular vote outweigh the negatives more then the electoral does. 
4218	The united states is a democracy so the citizens living here should have the right to vote for the president of the united states 
4219	With the electoral college the citizens are'nt the ones voting for the president the electors are. In the electoral college the voters are voting for a slate of electors, who then vote for the president. In most cases the elector votes for the candidate that their party wants, in some cases the elector has chosen the oppossing candidate to what his party wants according to the second source. Since the elector is allowed to do this that is one reason why the electoral college is unfair. Popular vote is when the people vote for the candidate they want this is truly what a democracy is when the people choose their representatives. 
4220	The electoral college is unfair to voters because of the winner-take-all system in all the states, 
4221	because candidates don't spent time in the states they know they will lose in. They only foucus on the states that they know they will win in or of a close chance to the other candidate, because of this there has been times when people would not see the candidates at all or they did'nt get to see a single campaign ad. If there was popular vote then this would not be the case and it would be eliminated, because candidates would have no choice but to put up advertisments all over the country. 
4222	The electoral college allowed some of are greatest presidents to win beacuse if they got more electoral votes then popular vote it would'nt matter they will still win. The electoral college also avoids the problem of one candidate not recieving the majority of the votes cast. The electoral college has been in are country for so long and has worked for us well but I still believe that the popular vote can be and  should be used in future elections 
4223	As we all know many people in the United States use phones in their everyday life, either at work or school and even just at home. Our phones are very useful and in my experiences helped me a lot in my time of needs, however many people use it for the wrong reasons. 
4224	The driverless cars this article discusses are not actually driverless, 
4225	they are not legal, 
4226	there is no telling what future problems may arise. 
4227	Shouldn't a truly driverless car not require a human at all? I personally believe a driverless car should be able to navigate itself without human interferance. If it requires a human, then what is the point of calling it driverless? 
4228	 Not only are driverless cars not fully developed, but they are not even legal 
4229	A myriad of problems could arise pertaining to driverless cars 
4230	"The article mentioned a very real problem in driverless cars: if something goes awry and someone in injured, who is at fault? These cases would resort in major courtroom battles between average people and multi-million dollar companies. Another potential problem with driverless cars is the change off between driver and robot. If the car signals the driver and the driver does not respond, then what would the car do? A multitude of problems could appear, and all automakers can do is hope they will be abloe to find solutions to these probelms. To quote the article, ""Automakers are continuing their work on the assumption that the problems ahead will be solved."" Not only are the companies unsure of what issues will surface, but they are not completely sure they will be able to find solutions. "
4231	Driverless cars are getting attention, but as soon as the public knows they will only be for wealthy hands for a bit of time, the excitment will die down.  
4232	The system works, and it works well, so why change it? Driverless cars may sound high-end and futurisitc, but our cars now do the job well. Plus, there are hazads and roadblocks the driverless cars will have to overcome first. Should we really make state legislatures waste time debating the use of a driverless car that is not completely driverless? Driverless cars have benefits, but they are not street legal. I see no point in spending money for a car that cannot be driven in most streets and is not able to operate without a human there to takeover incase something goes wrong. 
4233	my belief is that America needs to evolve. The people are in need of better public transportation and infrastructure. If we can create vehicles that can transport people at high speed and wove our transportation issues in America. We can pay for it and create with the help of tax payer dollars and companies willing to work with the government. If we follow the basic outline put forward and expand upon it we can achieve many things and creat many things the people of America and the world need. 
4234	"Look at the 2000 election. Al Gore, an amazing guy, ""had more individual votes then George w. Bush."" This guy would of been a great president but  ""Bush won the election, receiving 271 electoral votes to Gore's 266."" "
4235	"I believed this was unfair because one person could of one but another man had got more ""popularity"" votes and won. Now tell me why that is fair? "
4236	"The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualifed citizens."" This means that the people of the state can vote buts it really not going to count. These people want a good president and it happened in 2012. Alot of Southern states like Mitt Romney and they voted for him. He got alot of votes and was beating Obama. But Obama got""61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percentpf the votes for Romney."" Romney had change in his eyes and the Electoral College didnt care and took that away from him. "
4237	To conclude this, the Electoral College is unfair. They take people's chances to change this country and do new things for us. If we had Mitt Romney, America might of had better imployment and a better system. We would of probulay had more money and had a better chance of going to college. But the Electoral College is unfair and had to take that away from Mitt and gave it to Obama. It's so outdated and unfair. For God's sake, its from 1700's! We need to get a better system of voting next time or people or just stop going to vote because they will know thay their votes mean nothing to the college and they will stop. If these people stop voting.... then we better have a backup plan to restore the country.                    
4238	In the current era, you never have to step foot in a public school ever again. Yes, you are still lawfully required to complete the majority of your secondary education, but the ever growing access to laptops and other electronic devices has introduced a new method for students to earn their highschool diplomas 
4239	Some school districts now permit their students to learn and participate in class via internet or video conference. While this innovation may seem like a peek into the future of American schools, it is not without its share of faults. 
4240	Allowing students to take courses online takes away from school's greater lessons 
4241	limits the social interaction that teens crave 
4242	despite the argument that it will help students keep on top of their studies in typically absent-causing. 
4243	After every school year, students are expected to show mastery of the cirriculums in each of their core classes. What the final exams fail to measure, however, are the other critical life skills that students obtain in the classroom. For example, group projects do more for the individual than teach them a bunch of facts and figures. They also simulate the level of collaboration students will use regularly as future members of the workforce. Similarly, assigning nightly homework goes deeper than the teacher's desire to keep their pupils busy, as learning to balance piles of graded assignments is an effective way to teach lessons about time management. Taking online classes will enact these same skills to an extent, though the lack of classmates combined with a more flexible schedule puts students in a bit of a bubble. In other words, school becomes less about practical application and focuses significantly more on pure academic knowledg 
4244	While online classes accomplish the same goal in their cirriculums, they fall terribly short in teaching students other important life skills.  
4245	"social skills, much like life skills, have their place in students' daily lives as well. It might not feel like it when teachers are constantly telling their classes to ""quiet down"" and ""focus on their assignments"", but the adults within the school building are just as aware of the psychological and emotional benefits of social interaction as teens. Therefore, students attending traditional public schools are alotted time, such as lunch or study hall, to hang out with friends and strengthen their interpersonal relationships. It is for these same reasons that most schools host memorable events outside of their eight-hour days for students to enjoy. Proms, talent shows, sporting events, and other staples of American high school serve no other purpose than providing social entertainment and positive experiences. On the other hand, online classes force students to spend countless hours sitting behind a computer screen, completely separated from their peers. "
4246	Online classes, with their isolated environment, cause students to lack the same interaction and attention they recieve at school everyday. 
4247	Of course, schools would not offer their students online classes if it came with zero benefits. There is a strong arguement to be made in favor of virtual schooling when students are abesent for an extended period of time. 
4248	When faced with extreme situations, like severe illness or family emergencies, students must also stress over catching up on their work upon returning to school. Online classes would allow these students to complete assignments and learn course material outside of the classroom. 
4249	Nonetheless, this peace of mind is only applicable if the student is mentally and/or physically capable to do schoolwork while enduring such a taxing hardship. Online classes may come in handy when students would usually miss school, even the pros are of this school system are laced with cons.  
4250	The debate of online classes in place of traditional schooling is a complicated one. Allowing students to complete their academic career without actually attending school may help keep them on track, as they could continue to learn in situations that would otherwise require an absence, but at what price? Online classes cause students to miss out on important life lessons and practical skills, such as collaboration and time management, due the the structure of the assignments. Additionally, students will have less opportunites to interact with their peers and create long-lasting memories at school-sponsered events. For now, it is in the best interest of the children and the future society to keep students in the classroom. Allowing students to take courses online takes away from school's greater lessons and limits the social interaction that teens crave, despite the argument that it will help students keep on top of their studies in absent-causing situations.  
4251	Technology has a greater, more widespread impact on various facets of daily life than ever before. New technological developments now aid in routine, everyday tasks such as mail delivery, shopping, and even vacuuming the floor. One extremely common routine that technology is aiding in secondary schooling. In fact, many public and private schools at all levels are beginning to offer distance learning, or non-classroom settings such as virtual classes and video conferences that cover the same curriculum that a traditional classroom would 
4252	Students would benefit from from distance learning through online classrooms or video conferencing 
4253	offer remedies to personal issues that stem from classroom learning 
4254	provide an easier alternative for those who may have difficulty getting to school 
4255	it can allow students to work at their own pace instead of the pace dictated by a classroom setting. 
4256	A benefit of schooling through distance learning can be seen in those with personal issues that stem from or are triggered by a traditional classroom. 
4257	For example, many students have challenges such as social anxiety, ADD, or Asperger's which can be affected by large crowds or groups of people, aspects that a standard classroom offers. These large gatherings may make those affected very anxious or nervous, unable to focus, or susceptible to emotional or verbal outbursts. By moving the classroom to the home via distance learning, many of these problems brought on by large gatherings are eliminated because the student is now in the comfort of their own home, family, and possibly a couple other students, yet they are still obtaining the same education and life skills that a classroom would offer. In fact, they may even learn quicker and more successfully because of the elimination of these problems. These people with social disabilities would benefit from distance learning because it would resolve problems that occur at school which possibly hinder their learning.  
4258	Another benefit that distance learning has over traditional classroom settings is the elimination of difficulties stemmed from getting to and from schools that may affect the students' education or daily lives. 
4259	This benefit can be seen in rural areas of the country where the commute to school in the nearest city may be as much as fifty miles, with the added time of bus stops for every student who lives along the way. In these cases, the school day may only be seven hours, but a commute of up to ninety minutes in each direction can make school a time commitment of as much as ten hours every day, not to mention extracurricular activities that can take up even more time.  This is a serious burden on the daily lives of the students, especially with the need to complete homework and even just relax. Additionally, in some places, such as the Mid-Atlantic, one snowstorm of twenty inches or so can close schools for a week or more due to the lack of equipment to handle those occasional storms. This lost time can limit and hinder students' education simply because they are unable to get to school. Distance learning, so long as power is on, can heavily limit or even eliminate the impacts of such weather events or long commutes by taking away the commuting aspect of school so that the students can stick to the ideal schedule to maximize their education. Distance learning benefits these groups of people by providing an efficient and routine schedule that students can maximize their education on. 
4260	A third positive outcome of distance learning is the allowance for students taking part in these programs to work at their own pace. 
4261	With traditional schooling methods, students are placed in classes of as many as thirty peers all trying to obtain the same education and lesson within the time constraints of the class. As with any large group of adolescents, some students will quickly catch on, while some will take longer to grasp the material. However, when one teacher is controlling a classroom of thirty different learning paces, they have to attempt to find a happy medium to teach the curriculum, and they are additionally limited to the constraint of a 45- to ninety-minute class period. This leaves the quicker students bored and unsatisfied while the slower students are left to struggle to continue to catch up to the teacher's pace. This issue is especially prevalent in an AP or college level class, where there is a lot of material thrown at the students at once. With distance learning, however, students have the benefit of learning at their own pace. Because of the eternal availability of the internet and email as well as abundant resources both in virtual classrooms and on the web, students are able to quickly tackle the subjects that come easy to them while also able to slow down, ask questions, and get additional help on topics that they struggle on. By not having to conform to a teacher's pace, students are more likely to succeed at their own pace, which is encouraged through distance learning. 
4262	Among the benefits it has are provision of a more comfortable environment for students with learning or other disabilities, elimination of problems brought on by long or challenging commutes to school, and the ability for students to learn at their own pace to maximize their understanding of the material, all while learning the same subjects they would learn in a classroom All in all, while classroom learning has proven to be effective in years past, there are many additional benefits of distance learning, and because of this, it can be expected to expand further in the coming years.        
4263	I think we should change the election by popular vote 
4264	The Electoral College is unfair 
4265	The Electoral College process is so much more complicated and long than popular vote, so why do we still use the Electoral College? We shouldn't. 
4266	After reading the article and going over it I believe that the Electoral College is a great idea. There are many great things about but then there are things that you dislike about it. Not everything can be perfect but the Electoral College is trying to get that way. The presidant is still getting voted every 4 years and hopefully it stays like that for a very long time. Those were all my reasons on why I thought the Electoral College is the right way to go.            
4267	"While I normally don't have any complaints, and being the person I am not many things ""bug me"", but I recently found that I disagree with a certain argument. And while it is near voting times, I believed it's best for me to send you my side on this continuous debate to change your mind on the matter. The electoral college has had its share of arguments and I would like to make my side seen knowing I have quite a bit of logical arguments. Please read with an open mind.  "
4268	The electoral college gives an easier way to get  tie, and although a tie hasn't been a main focus, it can prove to be a problem. 
4269	I read an article stating that if a tie were to happen the election would be thrown to the house of representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. This would anger a heap of people for many reasons, one stating it would almost rule out their vote. 
4270	Secondly, the electoral college simply takes away from voting in general. 
4271	An example of this is lets say Obama won popular vote, he should win because thats what America wants right? No, because what if another president won electoral vote? that president would win and take away the point in voting. This is unfair because we the people would like to have a better say in who becomes our president. 
4272	"In the article I read, it stated ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. unfair, outdated, irrational"" I agree completely "
4273	How is it irrational? Well simply because it is just an extra step added on. In all reality our country would be fine without it. Popular vote is exactly what we need, and that alone is enough. And while I do believe it's good to go an extra step, it shouldn't go when not needed. This to me is most important because I could argue all day long and in the end this would be my argument. 
4274	To begin with, I think the principal should require community service. This is because it teaches life lessons that will help you in the future. 
4275	For example, I volunteer for community service at a place called PET. This stands for Personal Energy Transportation. It is an amazing thing to do. You build all-terrain wheel chairs for handicapped people all over the world, but mostly in third world countries. The wheel chairs have three wheels and are designed to go through deep sand, over sharp rocks, and up and down steep inclines. In this workshop, it teaches teamwork, and makes you more mechanically minded. It is also a very courageous, bold, selfless thing to do and it will really change someone's life. Another example is that people sometimes down want to do certain activities because their boring. With required community service that will have to do things that they normally wouldn't do. By doing these things they build character and self esteem. This will help them in the future with doing homework, getting into a good college, and even with wanting to do community service again. This is why our principal should require community service. 
4276	In addition, I think the principal should require community service because it is good for the community. 
4277	t help the community in times of need. For example, when you are driving down a busy road or highway you see people throwing bags, cigarette buds, and even clothes out windows of their cars, not worrying about were they end up, in sewers, on the sides of roads, even inside animals. There are some types of community service that actually pick up all this trash around a city. This is important because it teaches character and it makes the city look better and more professional. Another example is that it community service could help other people in the community. There are elder homes where people drop off their elders that can't take care of themselves and people take care of them there. Some workers use this for community service or that is even their job. It can help you in the future to teach you how to take care of elderly people and it even help the community so the people that work out in the city don't get slowed down by having to take care of them. It could also make the elders feel wanted and feel comfortable in a new home. This is why our principal should require community service. 
4278	In conclusion, our principal should require community service. This is because it teaches life lessons and it's good for the community. Life lessons help you later of in life when trying to apply for a college or helping out a friend. Community service also changes people's lives. 
4279	in the case of nationally voting to decide our vital political figures, such as the President and Vice-President, the ballot of the Electoral College is not giving the voters of America a fair result when it comes to the final moments of a presidental election. 
4280	the electors for the state of which a citizen is voting in can be easily overturned to a vote for the canidate of which is opposite to what that citizen has elected to vote for. 
4281	The Face, however, is an illusion using the shadows as the eyes, mouth, and the nose. 
4282	Aliens never made the Face of Mars and the Face of Mars isn't real at all! It's just a natural landform by having the shadows covering up most of the landform making it appear as a face. For the conclusion, Cydonia has a natural landform on it that appears itself as a face using the shadows to make the illusion. 
4283	The Electoral College is a good way to make sure that a election won't end in a tie 
4284	It also makes sure that certain regions, or states, don't control the vote with their population. 
4285	The Electoral College is very good at insuring one winner. 
4286	"It has this ability, because to be a tie both canidates have to have 269 votes which is highly unlikly. To have a President chossen majority has to vote one way (270). Now with a ""winner-takes-all"" system that his country, USA, has, there are only so many combinations of states' votes for one party that there would be a tie. Since the beggening of the Electoral College there has only been two ties. The Electoral College does make it easier for there not to be a tie, because more people voting into selected individuals then having them vote makes it easier for less mess ups and faster counting of votes. "
4287	The Electoral College also makes sure one part of the country does not get favored and make the others feel like their votes did not count. 
4288	If one canidate is favored in a area and if it has a lot of people then that candidate would win with a direct vote. The bigger cities with more people would get every political ad and the canidates would be more focused there instead of getting everyone's opinion. The other places would feel left out and would be less likely to vote meaning not a true meaning of who majority wants as President. 
4289	 There is pleanty of things wrong in this world, but one thing that is pretty good right now is the Electoral College. More times than not it has one winner and one loser, and rarely a tie. It makes sure that nobody is a favorite or feels like it. Also it shows things can change if something is a problem or needs fixing. The Electoral College is not perfect, but is not broken. Thank you for reading my letter, I hope you take it into concideration when deciding to keep it or not.  
4290	I believe that doing community service is a good thing to do for others, but I also believe that people should be able to do what they want or need to do. 
4291	so I think we should at least vote to it. 
4292	That way it will be a fair decision by the people for the people. 
4293	It would be good to clean up trash or help others, but people also like spending their time on their own terms, therefore a vote in favor or not in favor would be best. 
4294	Another good idea would be to have a meeting with parents and teachers and see what they think of this 
4295	kids love to play video games, watch T.V. and sit around now, because it's more fun to them then cleaning up trash, or helping someone out, I am Against doing community service, but if you chose any of the ideas in this letter, it's up to the students, the teachers, and the parents now. 
4296	The Electoral College is a process not a place. When the founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and also a popular vote of approved citizens. 
4297	The Electoral College is a method of voting for President and Vice President that was produced by our founding fathers in the articles of the Constitution. The Electoral College has been in use for centuries, but it is time that we disregard it. 
4298	The Electoral College was a smart idea in the seventeen and eighteen hundreds, but as our country continues to change, it is necessary to change the way that we elect our leaders. The Electoral College has remained untouched and exactly the same for hundreds of years and this has caused it to be extremely outdated. 
4299	The question of whether or not to abolish or keep the Electoral College in tact is a heavily debated one, but it is clear that getting rid of the Electoral College will be highly beneficial to the voters of America. The Electoral College was established hundreds of years ago when our Constitution came about and it created a complicated process to elect the President and Vice President of the United States. 
4300	"Our country is changing day by day, and we certainly have made monumental changes since the Electoral College came to be. According to Bradford Plumer, author of, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,"" a poll was taken by Gallup in the year 2000 that showed that less than just forty percent of Americans support the election system that we have now. This proves that it is time for a change and that the system that we currently have in place has been in place for far too long. The everchanging United States of America is in desperate need of an up-to-date election system that fits the current needs of the American people. The Electoral College is not only outdated, but it is also an extremely complex voting method. In an article entitled, ""What Is the Electoral College,"" written by the Office of the Federal Register, it is explained that the Electoral College is a lengthy process that involves the choosing of electors and the issuing of Certificates of Ascertainment after both the people and the electors have voted. The Electoral College does far more harm than good for our country and for this reason especially, I believe that America should begin to elect its Presidents using the popular voting method. "
4301	"In his article, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,"" Bradford Plumer specifically states that the people themselves do not vote for their desired candidate, but instead, they vote for electors who then vote for the more popular presidential candidate. The people should be the ones who vote for the president because they will be the ones who are governed by the president. The Electoral College gives no voice to the people and is considered by many to be a non-democratic way of voting and is often referred to anachronism. Today, it is a struggle to encourage people to vote and be present on election day because no one feels like their vote matters. People say that one vote doesn't make a difference and that there is no point in filling out a ballot if it has no real affect on which candidate is chosen. The Electoral College and the process it established is really just confirming these opinions. People do not feel like they are contributing because when it comes down to it, the electoral votes are the deciding votes. The Electoral College only has a little over five hundred electors that are representing the millions of regular people who show up at the polls on election day. In order to make the people feel like their opinions are being voiced and their voice is being heard, and to increase voter turnout on election day, it is imperative that the country switches over to election by popular vote.  "
4302	"Not only is it not hard to accomplish, but it has happened before. According to Bradford Plumer in his article, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,"" in the early 1960s, people who favored races being seperated in society were almost able to replace Democratic electors with a new set of electors who supported the opposite party. Also, some corrupt electors who are not pleased with the popular vote will simply vote for whomever they please. Electors clearly have trouble being trusted and there is obviously some extreme dislike for the system we have now. The Electoral College also causes some problems when instances like a tie in the electoral vote come about. In this case, a tie in the Electoral College would be thrown to the House of Representatives, who would then vote for the President. The Electoral College brings about uneccessary problems that could all be avoided if the country converted the way of electing to election by popular vote. "
4303	In summation, the Electoral College has been around for hundreds of years, but it is time that the United States makes the change that would improve the way of electing its future Presidents. The Electoral College is outdated and complicated, does not allow the voice of the people to be heard, and leads to uneccessary voting complications. For these reasons, I vehemently feel that we should switch from the Electoral College to election by popular vote.         
4304	Being a person of politics yourself, you of all people should know that many compromises have been made over the course of the establishment of the United States. However, some of the compromises, like the electoral college, were made because of factors in the past and are now not needed in today's modern democracy. While the electoral college once worked as a compromise in the past, it is an archaic system that unfairly represents the votes of citizens all across the nation. 
4305	A popular vote should instead be utilized to fairly choose the people of power in this country and would better represent voters' opinions.  
4306	In implementing the electoral college, most states' votes either go to one candidate or the other, leading to candidates to only campaign in swing states (Bradford Plumer 13). 
4307	This may not seem like much of a problem 
4308	but consider this: a swing state such as Florida with over 20 electoral votes could go to a candidate who could have won by a 51 to 49 percent margin. This means that all the voters who voted for the other candidate no longer count, making the electoral college ineffective at voicing the opinions of the populous. 
4309	Also, many states may not even see the future president at all, like in the 2000 election where the candidates did not even go once and talk in seventeen states. This leads to a poor democracy because voters in these states will surmise that if the president will not bother to visit their state, they shouldn't bother on making an educated decision when voting, or may choose to not vote at all. In a election by popular vote, presidents will have to make greater strides in getting the people's votes and citizens will then have more of an impetus in learning more about their country's government and politics. 
4310	With the Electoral College, there is also the risk that electors may not necessarily vote for the candidate the people want as president. 
4311	"In the Electoral College, ""voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president"" (Bradford 10). These electors may not necessarily vote for what candidate voters want most as president, and could do what they might feel is the best decision; however, this is not always what the majority of voters want in a president and could end up with a poor president. In addition, most voters know very little about how these electors are chosen and are not in control of who their state's electors are. In a way this system is a bit corrupt, because the voters don't have the final say of the president. "
4312	In addition, a tie is likely in an electoral vote because of swing states, which has the potential to lead to a disaster. 
4313	If two candidates receive the same number of electoral votes and tie in an election, the House of Representatives then chooses the president, while the Senate choose the vice president, but their votes may not show who voters want as president, seeing that voters often vote one party for president while the other for their representatives (Plumer 12). The vote for president is distributed unevenly, and states with many voters will only be represented by one vote. this could lead to the House of Representatives choosing a president that is only liked by a small population and this cannot easily be undone. Swing states are the only thing that can cause or prevent a tie in elections, and a tie has almost occured in 1976 in Hawaii and in 1968 in Ohio. 
4314	Those in favor of the electoral college argue that because candidates will focus on swing states in order to win voters in those states will pay closer attention to the election and make a more educated decision (Richard A. Posner 20). 
4315	However, this is not necessarily the case, and there are plenty of other well-educated voters in other states who have opinions that will never be counted because of the electoral college. 
4316	If the popular vote becomes the new method in choosing the president, voters all across the nation will pay more attention to elections because they feel that their vote can make a difference, and it will. This will in turn increase the number of voters actively paying attention to their country's decisions. 
4317	"Because of the Electoral College, ""about one-half the eligible American population did vote in [2012's] election"" (Posner 23). Although this number is mentioned as a success in Posner's arguement, this means that there is one-half of American voices left unheard. Democracy only works if all citizens vote, but they will only take the time to vote if they know that they can make a difference.  "
4318	Change needs to happen and it has to soon. If not, a poor president could be elected and then who knows what bad things could happen? With the popular vote, more people will be heard, and they will better take part in their country's government, leading to a better nation.         
4319	If the school policy was changed there would not be many students participating in sports or other activities. 
4320	Many students have a grade C average which would inconvenient them from participating in school sports and/or activities.  Not many students who have a grade B average are athletic to participate in sports but would enjoy participating in school activities such as clubs. But if there are not enough students to participate in school sports it would just be a waste of money to purchase equipment for those sports. Many students who play sports have a grade C average and are very athletic students. It would also be unfortunate for students who do play sports to not be able to participate if they have a grade C average. If those students do not participate they would probably not participate in school activities that they do not enjoy.  
4321	Changing school policy is also a bad idea because many students rely on athletic scholarships to get into college since not all families are lucky enough to send their children to college without having to worry about have financial problems doing so 
4322	But since the prices for college tuition is going up not many students have enough money to attend college right after high school. Many of those students also have a grade C average. Also many students who are very good at sports but not very academically skilled may see that sports are what help them get by in life. Those students also find it very difficult to get into a good college they can afford if they have a grade C average but do not have a chance to get into a college if they cannot get a scholarship for athleticism.  
4323	Driverless cars would be very beneficial to our society. It would make an immense impact on our culture and provide simple, fast ways to get around. In the article, many different positives are thoughouly expressed. 
4324	Because of these specific examples, I believe that driverless cars will be extremely important in America's future and greatly benefit our use of transportation.  
4325	"The United States, as well as other parts of the world, experience oil and fuel issues. There are frequent shortages of these particular substances, which are extrememly important for our daily lives. In the article, it is said, ""The cars he foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus. He believes such cars would fundamentally change the world."" In this quote, from the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" Google cofounder Sergey Brin expresses that these driverless cars will be beneficial to America and the rest of the world "
4326	He says that these cars will use less fuel, which unfortunately tends to run short. Driverless cars will benefit the the world's fuel issues. 
4327	Another positive to driverless cars are the entertainment and noficiation aspects. Drivers will be able to get different things done while driving. 
4328	"They also will no longer need to worry about distraction factor of driving. Drivers won't have to worry about trying to answer a phone call, respond to a text, or change a song and drive at the same time. The article states, ""Some manufacturers hope to do that by bringing in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays. Such displays can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over-something not available to driveres trying to text with a cell phone. In this way, the in-car system is actually a safety feature, and safety is a big concern."" In this quote, Dr. Werner Huber, a BMW project manager driver, explains that a driver won't need to worry about answering a text. The driver can answer the text or phone call while the car is not in need of assistance. Fortunately, the car only needs manual assistance in areas of road construction or accidents. This feature of driverless cars will greatly benefit driving today. "
4329	"However, these driverless cars still do obtain some faults. These faults are included in the article. ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents. This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires."" This shows that drivers must retain some sort of awareness of what is going on around them. They cannot take naps or completely zone out, especially when approaching an accident or work zone. "
4330	"Although there are few flaws to the designs of driverless cars, these flaws should be fixed very soon. The article states, ""Automakers are continuing their work on the assumption that the problems ahead will be solved. Tesla has projected a 2016 release for a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time. Mercedes-Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have cars that can drive themselves by 2020. The road to the truly autonomous car stretches on ahead of us, but we grow closer to the destination every day."" This quote shows that many of these issues should be resolved in the very near future.  "
4331	"Because of these specific examples in the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" I believe that driverless cars will be very beneficial to America and it's many modes of transportation. Driverless cars will use less fuel than our typical cars we use today. They will also require an immensely small amount of attention. Most importantly, any small flaw that these cars possess will be resolved extremely soon. Driverless cars will change our lives for the better. "
4332	When the US Constitution was first made, the idea of equality between the states was made. This meant that the size or population of a state gave it no disinct advantage over another. They did this through the creation of the House of Representatives and the Senate, yet there was one more issue they had to solve. This issue was how they could count the votes of citizens all aroun the US fairly. They solved it with electoral college, a system in which the voters don't directly vote for the president, but vote for a group, or slate, of people who have sworn to a canidate who vote for you. This system as Source 2 states can easily be broken with a group of swing votes in some states, but because it keeps thing equal, we must see that making popular vote the process isn't a good idea, because larger states will have more power. 
4333	"The US should just remove the winner take all system and replace it with 'proportional representation"" to preserve equality and functionality. "
4334	As Source 1 states, this proportional representation is only done by Maine and Nebraska, but it makes it so that one party wont win the state, it is reigional in the state meaning that more people are represented through this. The winner take all system is too harsh, and can discount many people in swing and regular states. As Source 3 stated, the larger states need to be left alone to represent the US population. Proportional representation allows this with the ability to include even more opinions. With this informatin, it is easy to see how proportional representation will preserve the equality that popular vote represents. 
4335	One of the main arguments for electoral college, is that  it is more functional as compared to popular vote. This can be maintained through proportional representation. Source 3 stated that while the reguar electoral college has a chance of failing, it is not as high of a chance as popular vote is. Proportional representation keeps this functionality that those who support normal electoral college hide behind. This is also been proven to work without a hitch. As previously mentioned, Source 1 stated that this for of electoral college is already in Maine and Nebraska. These states have proven that this form of electoral college works, thus proving that we should change to proportional representation in order to maintain the functionality of regular electoral college. 
4336	"In conclusion, we should switch the rules of electoral college from ""winner takes all"" to ""proportional representation"" in order to maintain equality and functionality. showing that while the founding fathers did have the best on their minds when electoral college was made, a change in it can benifit America for years to come.    "
4337	I think it isn't a very good idea for it to be mandatory to perform community service. 
4338	It gives less opportunities for students to succeed in their goals, 
4339	it takes out our free time which gives us time to have fun and learn new things 
4340	For example, if a student wanted to learn how to play an instrument, they wouldn't be able to learn it because there would be no time for lessons. They would have to be doing community service which would take away the opportunity to learn. They also have many other responsibilities besides community service such as taking care of a younger sibling, focusing on school and education, house chores, and many others. Community service would be another responsibility that a child would have to take on and which maybe not even be prepared for. 
4341	Students wouldn't be able to have fun and enjoy their lives if they are stuck doing community service. They wouldn't have social time to hang out with their friends. They wouldn't even have time to be with their family as much. Children would be very miserable and would be very depressed at a young age. They wouldn't have to much of a great memory as a child either. 
4342	Community service isn't a very good thing to make students perform at an early age. It takes away time and opportunities and gives too much responsibility to students. Students should be able to enjoy their childhood and not remember it as cleaning up litter. 
4343	I think the idea of every kid having to do community service is a great idea. 
4344	It would help show the kids that by helping your community you are helping out everybody. 
4345	It also shows the pride and character each student has in their community. 
4346	If most kids don't help by doing something where they live they usually don't appreciate what they have were they live. Community service is a great way of helping give back what your city or town gives to you everyday.  
4347	Many ways you could help give out community service jobs would be to say they were getting something in reward for doing this task. 
4348	There are many different things you could get the kids to do to help their community. I encourage that you do make the students do community service. This can help them take more pride in what they do while in school and out of school 
4349	It would also make the school look better for encouraging community service. It would help give them more respect from the community. This would also help the whole community look better. It would give them respect from other communities and the state it is in. Getting respect from other places could help your town get new things to. It could help attract more businesses to the community. It could also help the community grow by having more people move to live there bringing new cultures to the community. 
4350	There are many things that community service could do for your community. It helps bring new ideas and ways of life, brings more respect, and brings more pride to your town. All these things help your community grow and socialize. They all affect you in many good ways to help everybody. These were just some ideas I was writing to you about making every student do at least some community service. I think it is a great idea and will encourage it all the time. 
4351	In conclusion, why is the Electoral college unhealthy? This system of voting is outdated and has many flaws throughout its system. Without this system being changed is could have a tremendous affect in the future of the United States. This irrational system lacks a basis in reality. The arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. It is difficult to say but the Electoral College in general was a mistake.  
4352	Community service can help students with that by helping others and not feeling so alone. Like this one girl i knew was so caught up with her studies all she did then was go into her room and lock herself up. Later , when i noticed she'd gone too far i told her to help me clean up the streets that were covered in litter. She did and then from then on she found time for her work, friends, and community service 
4353	"Next, do you the saying ""you learn something new everyday."" Well its true with community service you can learn things you never knew before. "
4354	One time my aunt went to a park because of an oil spill and she helped out with cleaning the damage. While she was there someone who knew a lot about wild life taught her about the different species. Later in life we went for a walk and on the streets we saw a snake that looked like a very poisonous one, but my aunt with her new knowledge of wildlife knew exactly what it was. Good thing she went to that park for community service and learned about different animals. 
4355	Well some students may get involved with something wrong while they are bored. Sometimes students get into drugs but instead of that they could do something useful. Community service can help keep kids of drugs and do something good.  Of course I get bored all the time but when i do i usually help other people like mowing the lawn, gardening, babysitting and its all fun. 
4356	Since the Electoral College was hundreds of years ago, it does not account for all of the new technologies that have been developed since then. 
4357	Due to the Electoral College relying on a majority rules system, the vote of a single person can be completely insignificant. 
4358	"According to source 3, a supporter of the Electoral College, ""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election...."" This should not be the case when voting. Voters should research their choice as if the election relied completely on them. But instead, there is a system in place where somebody's vote can be rendered completely useless in not multiple ways! For example, if a state already has their majority of citizens voting for president A, if somebody votes for president B it will be as if they didn't vote at all! Even in a case where the state is completely 50:50 on who to give the electoral votes to, if the last person votes for president A, tipping the majority in his favor, according to source 2, ""... those electors could always defy the will of the people,"" and end up voting for President B. The Electoral College is an anti-thesis to democracy, because a citizen's vote can be rendered completely pointless at multiple points. "
4359	To put this into perspective, here's an example of why supporting big swing states should not be rewarded. The US has 6 states. 5 are completely democrats and each have populations of 20. 1 is half democrat half republican and has a population of 100(assume 20 people equals an electoral vote). If the republican presidential candidate convinces a single democrat in the big state to vote for them, they will get the majority vote in that state and get 5 electoral votes. This results in the democratic presidential candidate, with 149 people supporting him, tying with the republican presidential candidate, with 51 people supporting him. Simple logic shows that the opinion of 149 people is more important than that of 51 people, so a popular vote system would have been best in this situation. 
4360	"In conclusion, the Electoral College should be replaced by the popular vote system as soon as possible. The Electoral College relies on archaic methods to make tallying votes simpler for the government, which results in problems. It's like the government is rounding the votes. The winner-takes-all method of the Electoral College can render a voter's vote completely useless, and it even allows representatives to vote for the presidential candidate that is against the voter's wills. Presidential candidates will not bother campaigning in states that are loyal to their adversary or are too small to be worth their time. While a single person's opinion might not seem important, or rounding votes seems ""easier,"" no corners should ever be cut when deciding who the leader of a nation with over 50 million citizens is, which is why the Electoral College should be replaced by the popular vote system.    "
4361	Cell phones today are generally used for many reasons. They may be used for texting, calling, emergencies, and many more reasons. Shocking but true, in this day in time, people need cell phones. Some may be against this matter, but do they know everything besides teens texting everywhere they go? Cell phones are one of the major ways of communicating. 
4362	First and foremost, cell phones are a major way of communicating. Students may need to communicate with parents, siblings, and other students. 
4363	Calling your parent for a quick minute or two may secure your way of getting home or even to obtain a book you might have left at home for your next class. Also, talking to other classmates throughout your school may give you extra time to study with them or to finish a couple of assignments you were unsure about or needed help on. Communicating with cell phones will provide you extra time to do this by sending a text or giving them a quick call, after all lunch time and free periods don't last forever. This takes less time and gives you extra time for many other priorities you may have. 
4364	Also, students need a little free time during the school day. If time is given to them to have their cell phones out and to check what they need to, students may not be prompted to sneak a text in class. 
4365	Eight out of ten schools who allowed students to have their phone out at a specific time of day saw a decrease in the number of phones out during class time. Giving students this time will show that you trust them to do what they are supposed to in class. Plus, students may realize administrators trust them to keep their phones off and in their pockets during class. 
4366	Therefore, providing trust is a key to students. Showing them they have trust may provide the whole school with many other positive characteristics 
4367	Students may feel they are being rewarded with a little free time by having their cell phones out. If this opportunity is given 99% of students may do better in school. Many may think this just gives students a way to have their cell phones out without getting in trouble for it. However, students are actually very responsible and may do the right thing. 
4368	All in all, changing the cell phone policy will benefit the school in various ways. There needs to be a sense of trust and knowing they have responsibility inside them first. Students aren't always going to do the right thing. However, giving them this time will allow them to escape and talk with friends that they may not see everyday. This new policy will provide everyone with many opportunities that will have a positive effect. 
4369	I stand with the makeing of these cars and the possiblities that come with in our society. The cars would be able to open new doors to health benefits, lowering crash ratios, and much more. The driverless car would be a great achievement in human curisosity and invention. These cars would better many different levels of society if made and used propely. 
4370	Drverless can be an innovation within our cumminties and cites. These cars could protect more lives and lower the amount of human recklessness that could be done at the wheel of a regular driven car. 
4371	If made fully driverless, the amount of intoxicated accidents, killing and pull overs by the police would be lowered substancially. These smart cars could detect when their driver is not keeping a minimal amount of focus on the road and alert them to any dangers that could obstruct their path or cause harm. Only increasing the level of safety and efficencess that it would be used for. 
4372	I do believe driverless cars if thought through and corrected for mistakes can become a valuable asset to modern day community. These cars could lead to a increase in driving, and traveling for families and could also lead to the question of what can we do with this technology now? I feel that these questions are a very good thing in the advanceing technology of this age and that the still developing cars should not be frowned upon, but seen as a step forward into atoumating our country. 
4373	However, not all people would want to do this. I personally think that community service is a volunteer job and that people of the community should do it at their own free will. Depending on what type of services the students would provide would vary the response in enthusiasm. My opinion to community service would be that every one needs to do their share in helping. 
4374	The Electoral College is point less. If the govenment wanted us to vote on the president then why have a college that does that for us? 
4375	"The Electoral College needs to be abolished, so that the peolpe of the U.S.A can vote on the president for real. People want a derect vote not just to sit and watched the peoson that they voted for not get elected becuase of a College that has all the ""power"" "
4376	Back in the 1960's Kennedy almost was not elected because of one state that state Louisiana 
4377	Our country prides it self on one thing freedom. Then we dont have the right to vote derectly on the peorson we want. So how in the world does that help us? 
4378	Coming in the next few years, driverless cars offer a safer, smarter, and more effective way to travel. 
4379	Driverless cars promise highly-advanded technology to provide safety and security for the passangers while allowing the human driver to ultimately remain in control.  
4380	 A driverless car is safer and more efficient. 
4381	With all of the driverless car's sensors and alerts, it is able to detect the situtation around it.  The car will be able to sense other cars, pedestrians, and landscape obastacles.  The driverless car will also be able to handle road situations better than a human would.  Since 2009, the driverless cars have been able to navigate over half a million miles without a crash.  Along with the car's safety, it is also more efficient than a normal car.  The driverless car would use half the fuel of today's taxis and allow more flexibility than a bus, making them the ideal mode of transport.  Even though it is driverless, the car also requires human control.  The driverless car will be able to steer, break, and accelerate on its own, but it will alert the driver when the situation requires.  The human driver must take over in situations such as navigating construction zones or accidents.  Even though the car is not completely self-driving, it allows for the human driver to ultimately remain in control of the situation.  With the driverless car's ability to analyze and respond to its surroundings while allowing human control, it will be the safest and most efficient car of the future. 
4382	The new-age technology provided in the driverless cars will make for a smarter car with the ability to be aware of the road, cars, and people, as well as any trouble that happens unexpectedly.  This technology also creates a safer drive while being efficient to the passengers and the environment.  With all of these self-driving features, the human driver will feel in control when navigating the required situations.  All of these technological advancements lead to a promising future of driverless cars everywhere. 
4383	but, was less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. For example the 2012 election, with Obama received a 61.7 percent of the electoral votes compared to Romney vote 51.3 percent of the popular vote cast. 
4384	I think that students should go perform community service. 
4385	The president of the united states is one of the most powerful political leaders in the world and controls the faith of one of the wealthiest countrys on the planet. There have been many discussions on how to elect the president of such a great nation. The Electoral College,  the founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. If its worked for over 200 years why change it. 
4386	The Electoral College provides certainty of outcome and avoids run-off elections and should be kept as the form of election of the U.S. president of our state. 
4387	To Begin With, the Electoral College has been used for more than 200 years and our state is fighting for another 200 years of electoral college. 
4388	"In an article by Richard A. Posner called ""In Defense Of The Electoral College:Five Reasons To Keep Our Despised Method Of ChoosingThe President"" he states ""there are...reasons for retainig the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree: all are practical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons.""  Amongst these reasons one of them is the certainty of outcome and in source 3 paragraph 18 it states that ""A dispue over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible-it happened in 2000-but its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reasons is that the winning candidates share of the popular vote."" Richard Posner is stating that Electoral College is more effective because it causes less trouble and does not need to be disputed unlike popular vote which needs to be disputed because the winning candidiates share of the Electoral college invaribly exceeds his share of the popular vote. "
4389	Furthermore, The electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate recieves a majority of the votes cast. 
4390	"In an article by Richard A. Posner called ""In Defense Of The Electoral College:Five Reasons To Keep Our Despised Method Of ChoosingThe President"" he says ""nixon in 1968 and clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electoral College (301 and 370). There is pressure for run off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; the presidential election process, is reduced by the electoral college, which invaribly produces a clear winner.""    "
4391	"Paragraph 15 says ""The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who recieves the most popular votes the winner. "
4392	"""A new president, really, How many votes did they win by?"" If someone were to ask you this what would you say, thirty electoral votes? "
4393	"The ""Winner-Takes-All"" system is flawed and needs to be either fixed or completly taken down, and here are two reasons why "
4394	First a president should be chosen by the people, seeing our county is a democracy meaning that we elect representatives to rule for us, a popular vote fits the sene a bit more than an electoral vote 
4395	Secondly if there was every a tie in the electoral college it would catostropic because intead if being in the peoples hand it be in the representatives hands, aslo known as the ones who already have power 
4396	"""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. because of the winner-takes-all system in each state canidates dont spend time in states they spend no time in stats the know thy wont win."" Some states can get no canidates out and its because the electoral college is unfair. ""It`s official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best argumants in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct election ar spurios at best. Its hard to say but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!"" This Quote states that the electoral college is not fair and down right rediculus "
4397	""" In 1968 a sift of just 41,971 could have cause a tie in the polls."" in this article just that many people and the representatives could have chosen a president and the reason this is bad is because they will get a president that will do what ever they want. ""If there were just 5,559 voters in ohio and 3,687 voters in hawaii that went the other way the electoral college would have tied making a representative choose."" "" in this article just that many people and the representatives could have chosen a president and the reason this is bad is because they will get a president that will do what ever they want "
4398	Although some students will miss out on the opportunity and experience of physically being present at school and going through their day with their fellow classmates, many students will benefit from being able to attend classes from home 
4399	each student's priorities 
4400	health 
4401	personal matters differ. 
4402	To being with, each person on earth does not have the same mindset and concerns as another. 
4403	Everyone has their own desires and values in life, even students. Though one may be attending school, they could also be wrapped up in another area of their life. Many students enrolled in schools right now do not only just focus on schoolwork, rather they are involved in many out-of-school actives. For example, students model, dance, make videos on the internet, and participate in travel sports. Having such a busy schedule, being able to get one's school work done outside of school can be very useful to many, because then they can try their best to fit everything into their schedules at any time or place of the day. All in all, having the work done, rather than not, is more beneficial to both students and teachers. 
4404	"Adding onto getting work done, many students prefer working in an environment special or more comfortable to them. One major reasoning for that is one's medical conditions. Nowadays, many public schools offer a special education program, but to many, the system might not exactly meet their requirements. Many handicap students need special transportation, seating, and feeding, which schools may not be able to provide. They also require alert attention at all times because anything could happen to cause them discomfort, pain, or even to fall down. Other students going through a health issue may find schooling at home to be rather more comfortable due to the same reasons. At home, the students will have their family members to look and care for them. Besides the staff not being able to properly handle students in need of altunitive care, the, ""regular,"" students attending the school can also be an issue. Kids of today are not the nicest and love tearing others down on their insecurities. Bullying could be a serious concern to many special education students. "
4405	Overall, one's health plays a huge role in one's schooling and place of schooling. 
4406	Along with students personal concerns, there are many problems that can arise at the homes of these students them to miss school. 
4407	School is one part of student's lives and some only have a limited amount of time they can put towards that one part. Many people struggle with family matters and are not always left out of them because they attend school. A student might be going to school everyday and as soon as they get home, they are taking care of another member in their family or cooking and cleaning. Many kids run their households because their parents are not in the right condition to act their part. This leads to students working and schooling. All those things take up a big portion of time and can cause much stress on the individual. Also, many times, students just fall ill out of nowhere, and are in such conditions where they have to stay home and rest. Having access to classes online and available to them at any given time reduces much burdens off their shoulders. No one really knows what goes on in student's lives outside of school, so the opportunity to attend classes should be permitted. 
4408	In conclusion, students would be able to benefit from being able to attend classes from home for many reasons. Their schedules, conditions, and personal reasons are all apart of this matter. If classes are not available to attend from home, many students will have lower grades due to concerns they can not help nor fix. Give students the right and privilege to do school work outside of the school building!  
4409	I do not think that students should be required to do community service. I believe that it should be a choice but only under certain circumstances. 
4410	If they choose to be in a club or any other school activity that requires them to do community service then they would have to or be kicked out of that club, if not then they should not have to. 
4411	The only reason that a student should have to do the community service when they are not in a club is if they got into some kind of trouble at school or during something related to school/on school grounds or if they accumulate so much detention that they don't make up another choice should be community service. 
4412	Another reason they could do community service is if they want to help out the community but not because they have to do it as punishment or to as curriculum for a club. 
4413	One of my examples is that if people that were on a soccer team or any other team did something that got them in trouble and they would not be given detention for is they could do community service instead. 
4414	Another example is that if a student had accumulated over 24 hours of detention and it was close to the end of the school year or a dance/ field trip that they really wanted to go to was coming up they could just make it up with the amount of community service that you and other faculty members decide is fit for the circumstances. 
4415	My final example is that a student could have a friend that is having trouble with math and they want to help their friend they do community service and help their friend with whatever he or she would need help with or if they see a park that is full of litter they could help clean it up. Maybe doing that the student could get extra credit to help their grade if they need to push it up a little. 
4416	Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Online or video conferencing is when students and teachers communicate through long distances through the use of technology. Students would be able to learn without the need to be in a classroom with other people. This would are able to help them learn more frequently and function more with the help of this learning capability. Students would be able to personally talk to teachers if there having trouble with work in class. 
4417	Although some believe with help the of online or video conferencing students would benefit less from being able to attend classes from home, it should be known that with the help of online or video conferencing students would benefit more from being able to attend classes from home.  
4418	With the help of online or video conferencing, students would benefit more from being able to attend classes from home due to benefits for oneself. Having access to online or video conferencing would more affordable for students. 
4419	They would be able to talk to teachers without the need of them spending their money. For instance, there are certain websites where students can learn and talk to teachers without them going to school. Nowadays, if a person would want to go to school but could not afford it, then they would use online conferencing to talk teachers without them wasting their money just to go school. Through the help video conferencing, students would be able to have personal conferences with teachers. If there are having trouble with their work or if they feel like they need help, then a conference would be a good way to better themselves. For example, if a person did bad on their test, exam or just want to help boost their grade up, then they would have a brief conference to see why their not doing so well. With the help of personal conferences, students can be able to improve their grade and better understand what their not good at. Students would be able to get their work caught up at home. Online chats will be able to see what that person missed. For instance, if a student missed a day or a lesson, then that student would be able to contact their teacher and get their work caught up. This is useful for students, who are sick and cant make it to class, because they wont be behind and they can get their work finished. 
4420	With the help of online or video conferencing, students would benefit more from being able to attend classes from home due to benefits for others. 
4421	Online conferencing would help students not to get sick by other people. Long distance conferencing would lower their chances of getting sick by others. For example, if students lived in China, where the Corona virus is spreading at, then they would communicate with their teacher online without them catching the virus as well. Online conferencing in today society would play a major role in helping both students and teachers lower their chance of catching colds or diseases. Students would not have to travel long distance to just go to school. With the of online conferencing, students can learn what they need to know at home. For instance, if a girl was pregnant and she didnt have no one to take her to school, then she would just talk to her talk online without the need of her leaving home. With the help of this technological advantage students, who cant find a way to get to school, would be able to learn in school without the need of them leaving their home. With the help of video conferences, the productivity of students' work would go up. This would help students who dont understand the work and what to know more. For example, if students dont understand the assignment they were given, they would be able to learn online with their teacher to better understand. With the help of this learning tool, they are able to learn at a better pace. 
4422	Even though some believe with the help of online or video conferencing students would benefit less from being able to attend classes from home, it should be understood that with the help of online or video conferencing students would benefit more from being able to attend classes from home. Opponents incorrectly believe that with the help of online or video conferencing students would benefit less from being able to attend classes from home because they might not have WIFI to communicating to their teachers and they might not look presentable when talking to their teachers. However, with the help of online or video conferencing students would benefit more from being able to attend classes from home because they would be able to get their work caught up with, it would be affordable for them, and students would be able to have personal conferences. Furthermore, with the help of online or video conferencing students would benefit more from being able to attend classes from home because they would not get sick by other students or teachers, they would not have to travel long distances to attend certain classes, and students would be more productive. Online and video conferences are new way for people to learn at home without struggling. They are able to learn in so many ways and can talk to their teachers if there is any confusion. 
4423	Education should be a school's top priority, and part of having educated students is having students that are as knowledgeable as they can possibly be. Each kid has different subjects or activities that they excel at. Some may do well at math while having trouble in English, and others may be good at soccer but not so good in History class. 
4424	If you change school policy and make it so that students can't participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a B average, you are preventing students from being their best at what they do or in other words, being knowledgeable in their activity. 
4425	Preventing kids from participating in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average will hinder their progress in improving their grades. 
4426	Staying involved in physical activity has proven to improve test scores and health for that matter. The health of my classmates should be very important to you considering that a sick student cannot attend class. Kids with excess energy will not pay attention and that is why sports teams and physical activities are incorporated in every school. Taking that away from kids with a lower average than a B will not improve their grades or help them gain knowledge, instead their grades will most likely start declining more with the short attention spans in class. Therefore, decreasing the knowledge that they take in and making them less knowledgeable. 
4427	You should always encourage us students to try our best, and what if our best is at a sport? Taking away the right to play sports because of low grades will take away our effort in trying our best. 
4428	Having a low grade in a subject that we aren't specifically doing well in, shouldn't prevent us from playing a sport that we excel in. We try our best in everything we do and it wouldn't be right to punish us by taking away an activity that we can excel in. To most of the students, sports mean everything to them and taking it away because of one bad grade will make them feel like their best didn't work so why should I keep trying. It defeats their self-confidence and willpower. This will make them slack off in class and therefore, decrease their knowledge. 
4429	Helping the community is the most important thing next to a education and we should all want to be a part of it no matter how young or old you are. The more that we can help our community the stronger it may become because people will invite friends to help. 
4430	The Electoral College is an old compromise the was made by the founding fathers, but some changes have to be made to fit the modern times and ways 
4431	I would like to bring to your attention the matter of the electoral college, and the unjust way that presidents are elected in our  country. While there are benefits, more of the negative effects come to play when reviewing and contemplating on whether this system is effect or not 
4432	The Electoral College is very unfair, and should be subject for abolishment 
4433	The number of electors in the Electoral College consits of 538 electors in total, which makes a tie completley possible, although it has never happened, in the past only a few more votes were required to create this unlikley problem 
4434	"According to source 3, paragraph 18, Richard A. Posner claims that, ""A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes-538- is an even number, but it is highly unlikley..."" There's a shockingly short ammount of votes required to turn an election into a situtation where both canidates have an even number of votes, a problem almost occured in 1976, that were if, according to source #2, paragraph #12, Bradford Plumer, ""a mere 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way."" Those may look as if they are big numbers, however in comparison to the amount of voters in each state, these are not large amounts of people who needed to vote the other way. In comparison, the number of representatives is determined by the number of members in your congressional delegation, the amount of electors per state is fair. Still, however, the event of a tie would cause a lot of issues within our country, and would be relieved if the winner was elected by popular vote.  "
4435	In addition, electors are United States citizens, and are entitled to their own vote based on the Constitution, while they are allotted their own vote, this gives opportunity for problems to arrise 
4436	"Politics are very lowkey orders of buisness, and in 1960, the legislatures in Louisiana almost used the disaster factor to swing the election in their favor, by electing people who were more likley to vote for the opposer of John F. Kennedy, because they prefered the other canidate. According to source #3, paragraph 16, Posner addresses, ""..each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nomie (and that trust is rarely betrayed"". . . [; however,] it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote."" Since the electors can technically vote for whoever they desire, it can cause an unfair advantage to the electors sent who vote for the other candiate "
4437	The other factor tying in is that the voters feel as if their direct vote does not count. While it is true one vote cannot sway the election, it becomes apparent that canidates must have transregional appeal, meaning that they're favored in that region of the U.S. 
4438	"The canidates hold off on campaigning in states they already know they have dominated the votes in, because there is no one region that can elect a president. This makes voter feel inferior, and discourage them from ""wasting"" their time voting. If we use the majority of votes way to establish the new president, it is more likely that they will decide to vote once again, since they feel as if their opinion once again matters "
4439	In conclusion, the Electoral College seems unconstitutional, since a variety of issues can occur due to the many problems that could potentially occur. The United States should shift into a more reasonable and logical means of electing our president in our Republic, where everybody is equal. The Electoral College should no longer decide the president based on the possibility of a tie, the possibility for betrayal of trust and disputes due to how close the votes are. The system should change to where the popular opinion should  decide on the president of the United States of America, making people believe that their vote will be fairly counted. 
4440	There has been a strong arguement going on weather we should keep the Electoral College or if we should change it. Both sides have made a strong claim and a strong arguement. I got the opportunity to read two articles that are against and in favor of it. After reading these articles I have made decision. 
4441	Another reason why, we should keep Electoral College is that this would avoid the run off of elections 
4442	If there was no Electoral College candidates will be fighting for the popular vote. The problem with this popular vote is that there would be no candidate that recieves a majority of the votes. In an Electoral College there would not be this problem, since in each state the winner takes it all. 
4443	The electoral college is an institution that has always guided  the presidential elections. 
4444	The electoral college is tradition and shouldn't be changed 
4445	it has balanced relegation of power within the states, 
4446	almost always a definate winner, 
4447	it is able to hold a set timeline for the elections. 
4448	The college has always been able to choose a president that is able to lead our country well, 
4449	electoral college is a representation of the people of the United States of America. As the president's constituents, we have the power to choose our leader, and they make it a little easier for us. 
4450	This is why Wyoming has only three votes and Florida has twenty nine. It's nothing to complain about, because it's the same number of people each state has in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, meaning each state has at least three votes, decided by its population. This is not a very bad system because the states with huge populations have a bit of their power curbed by the number of electors. So if Wyoming increases its population, and Florida has its population decreased, one of the electors could be removed from Florida and added to Wyoming, balancing the scale of power between them. It's only fair for a populous state like Florida to have more electors anyway, there are many opinions that are yearning to be heard within the ginormous population, and there must be enough electors who can take it upon themselves to voice them. The Electoral College protects us from the probability of voting just because the candidate is from the same state. A majority of people will vote because of a close association with a candidate if the electoral college is abolished. This is why the electoral college only contains 538 people, because nobody wants millions of voters in California voting for the same candidate just because they are the Governor of California. 
4451	Due to the even amount of votes in the electoral college, there is a slight chance of a tie. 
4452	"However, with all but two states being part of the ""winner-take-all"" system, "
4453	This is why swing states are so important to the canditates, they know that the chances of them winning the votes in the other party's states are almost impossible, so they must gather all of the votes they can from the states that are known for their swing-like tendencies. It also goes the other way, each candidate trusts that their own party's states will vote for them, so there is no need to waste the money and campaign. Unless its the primary elections, candidates don't typically campaign where they know that the votes are all but set in stone. It's like going grocery shopping, if you know that you are allergic to peanut butter and you already have all the jam you need, you will only go for the special bread that everybody fights for right? The candidates are the same, they don't go after what they already have and what they can't have, only what they might earn, or else it's just a waste of money, so nobody should be able to complain about a candidates campaigning. 
4454	The election process is guided by this timeline, for example, voting starts on the second Thursday of the month of November every single time. The Electoral College is a huge part of this process also, and to destroy that would be heartbreaking for the nuerotics that can't stand any change in routine. If the Electoral College were to be abolished, and popular vote was to be instigated throughout the country, any semblance of a schedule would be torn away. Problems would spring up all over the place, and everything would all go to hell. Instead of recounts for counties, whole states would need recounts. If a populous state like Texas were to need a recount, never mind a week, a month wouldn't be enough time to recount it all perfectly. The government would be stuck without a leader, and worst case scenario, the United States of America could be put in a state of anarchy by the end of the decade. Then, we wouldn't be United anymore.  
4455	The Electoral College has been there from the beginning, and the without it the United States of America could be thrown into chaos. Traditions shouldn't be broken and the Electoral College represents the biggest one of them all, it balances power between each of the states, defines a true winner, and guides the U.S. on a set timeline. It wouldn't be a far stretch to say that the Electoral College helps keep the order of the country. Truthfully, everyone needs some semblance of order, and the Electoral College provides that and more.    
4456	Our school is a very complex school, with different varieties of personalities. Some people may find it relaxing to help others while some may not have the time to do so. Community service such as picking up litter on a busy high way or walking dogs for people who don't have the ability to do so would, in my opinion, builds character. Community service will help many others while making the students stop and realize that when you help people they may be helped in return. 
4457	I think it would be a good idea to offer community service but I do not think it should be mandatory. 
4458	Helping others is very important and will not only help the person the services are being provided for but also the helper. 
4459	All and all school is a place for education some may debate , but along with education you need responsibility which some students lack. 
4460	Maybe offer certain community services as extra credit. 
4461	hold a meeting 1 day a week during study hall/ advisory, or after school for dedicated students to brainstorm various ways to help the community. 
4462	As the principle and the final say in all school aspects I think it would be very rewarding to every one if we started community service as a school. 
4463	It would also give the school a better name and more and more people would want to volunteer and help the school out. 
4464	We could hold monthly annual field trips to various highways or if that may cause unnecessary commotion even a retiring home and visit with the elders. Any little thing could help. 
4465	All students should want to help others but the reality is not all care as much as others. 
4466	I think its important to instill the proper traits in school but its not just up to us. 
4467	I propose that twice a week we go from class room and recycle old and unused paper. 
4468	As for mandatory community services I don't think it should be, but I do think it would be very appreciated to many to offer community services to the population. Parents might even want to get involved and before you know it others will want to start. If you start with something minor and work your way up others will want to participation when they thinks its easy. My proposal to you is that we offer many different variates along with different time fames to offer our time and support of those who are willing and ready to perform acts of pure good deeds to further better our community. 
4469	The Electoral College has been established since the founding of our country. It is a system that has been tried and tested to work over the course of centuries. 
4470	It should be upheld for it's ability to produce a solid outcome, and though it has the possibility of failing it's faults are not worse than the popular vote system 
4471	This fair system allows representation of the people's will, just like the rest of our government does.  
4472	Faith in a certain outcome of the presidential election ensures that the vote has as little complications as possible, and is a reason the Electoral College is necessary 
4473	"According to source one, ""What Is The Electoral College?"", each political party has it's own set of electors that equal the amount of congressional delegates per state. Usually each state has a ""winner-take-all"" method, so the presidential candidate that gets majority in your state will get all of the electors that represent their party, not just most of them. This is beneficicial to the outcome of the election becuase it makes the ability for a candiate to get majority vote much simpler. There is less of a possibility of a tie, or an outcome where no candidate wins. Source 3, ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep out despised method of choosing president"", states that ""even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state..."" , therefore allowing the candidate to secure all votes to their side, instead of having the votes divided on the line of majority rule, and causing rifts between Electoral College voters.  "
4474	"No system is perfect, and the Electoral College is not exempt from this. ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"", Source 2, argues that a term called 'disaster factor', or the possibility of immenent disaster due to the Electoral College system, is why the Electoral College system should be abolished "
4475	"The passage uses individual instances, like the fact that in 1960, segrigationists in Lousiana nearly appointed Democratic electors that would vote against their candidate, or that in rare instances, ""faithless"" electoral voters would vote for the other side. "
4476	These are strawman arguments, using specific instances to come to a conclusion that the whole system should be abolished. While the Electoral College system isn't perfect, neither is the popular vote system 
4477	"The popular vote system has a higher chance of causing a tie between candidates, and it doesn't have a ""winner-take-all"" standard. In a tie, the vote would be given to the House of Representatives, which, according to source 2, ""..can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people.."", as citizens often vote one party in for president and another for Congress. "
4478	In addition, the Electoral College fosters a more nationwide appeal for the candidate's campaign 
4479	"Source 3 brings up the fact that no region in the United States has enough electoral votes to elect a president. The ""winner-take-all"" system further benefits this, because in order to win, candidates have to focus their attention on states where their majority vote is insecure. They will not focus on regions where they have essentially secured the majority rule and therefore secured all the electoral votes. In popular vote, they would have to focus extensively on those regions, as the few that are not in the majority would need convincing. Source 3 goes into detail as to why a regionally picked candidate is not a proper show of the will of the people. It states that ""The residents of other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised - to feel that thier votes do not count, that their new preident will have no regard for their interests..."", and so having a trans-regional appeal is essential to properly representing the will of United States citizens "
4480	Our Electoral College system should be defended and kept. It has the ability to produce a solid outcome, has flaws but ones that are not more disasterous than other systems, and drives candidates to try and present a national appeal. A single vote does not decide an election, the representation of our people should not be split in half, divided. The Electoral College does its best to give the nation the president it deserves. 
4481	I think that they should keep the electoral collage because the founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. 
4482	Over the years, the use of technology in schools has become more and more normalized, Sites, such as Blackboard and Google Classroom are used throughout the school year by teachers, students, as well as parents. There are many people that are skeptical about these changes, but especially the idea of schooling through online programs. Some feel as through it isn't in the best interest of students, and shouldn't replace a traditional education 
4483	allow more flexibility. 
4484	Students would benefit from enrolling in courses at home because it'll simply be easier for some. Mental illness can be very debilitating and can significantly affect a student's performance in school. 
4485	A lot of the time, this is overlooked, or simply ignored, as it is often stigmatized. Conditions such as anxiety and depression are common examples, and stress will simply exacerbate one's symptoms. Such things would make attending school extremely difficult for some students. Being able to do coursework at home would likely alleviate the problems they were having before, allow for improvement, and later success. Other things that people don't always think about, or may even look down upon, is treatment and recovery. Relapse, tragedy, etc would be common examples as well. Being able to do courses online might be the best option for someone that wants to take time off to get better, and return to school once they're ready. In conclusion, people face situations that others might not even think about, and so they shouldn't be stripped of an option that would ultimately be best for them. 
4486	Students would benefit from enrolling in courses at home because it allows for more options 
4487	Some may do better by planning out their day based on what works for them. For example, school is typically an 8 hour day, from 9am-3pm, 5 days a week. This is probably fine for most, but others simply can't operate like that. For example, some people might feel more attentive in the evening, and therefore can be more productive then. Some might have a hard time focusing for long amounts of time, and do better with breaks throughout the day. The list goes on. Traditional education is usually very restrictive and doesn't accommodate for people that don't do well with said issues. 
4488	Another reason this would be a better option for students, is so that one would be able to plan out their day and fulfill responsibilities. This might be work, taking care of siblings, or parents, and so on. But, it might also include other activities, like sports, music, travel, etc. Online schooling would be convenient for those with different lifestyles. In conclusion, all of these things would be made possible while allowing a student to receive adequate education. 
4489	In conclusion, the most important thing is that all of us have an opportunity for success, and whether one gets there online or on-site shouldn't matter. Everyone's situations aren't the same, and so each individual one should always be considered, not compared to others. Advancement of technology has helped many people all over the world, regarding education. The ability to receive an adequate one is essential for one's success and benefits the many people who don't have access to it. This not only includes K-12, but post-secondary education as well, as online degrees and certifcations are continously being introduced. 
4490	They're not the safest vehicles 
4491	could be really exspensive, 
4492	can cause issues with the law. 
4493	Vehicals that dive on there own can be very dangerous. 
4494	"Think about all the programming and manufacturing that would be in these cars, what if something goes wrong on the interstate? I know that the article says , ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills"" what if the driver cannot regain control of the vehicale when they need too? Major accidents can happen and can cause fatal injuries or death. There's already many wrong things that happen on the roads everyday , with people in control of their lives. So are you really going to let little computer chips control it for you? "
4495	Another thing wrong with these cars is the price tag! These cars could cost up too a fortune. 
4496	Have you ever seen the ones in movies? Normal mininmun wage people could never afford these vehicals. Car companies would raise be required too raise the prices on their cars because of all the extra electronices they would have to be put in these cars , so they can make the as safe as possible. Sooner or later all of the vehials could cost over $50,000 and a lot of people have trouble making that much money over a span of 2-4 years. 
4497	The biggest reason i am against these cars is because the issue they can cause with the law. 
4498	I know everybody has heard of a DUI , driving under the influence, charge. You get these if you are caught driving with a alcohol level over the state law , what happens if someone is completely drunk but the car is driving itsself? Does this give people the right to be intoxicated on the rodes because if somethig happens and the driver has to take control of the wheel they could kill somebody or theirselve. I feel like people would abuse these vehicals and do everything in them that they couldn't do in a normal car because at the end of the day they aren't driving. So this really goes back too the point that these vehicals aren't safe. 
4499	I think that what you are doing is wrong. Students should not be obligated to do community service if they do not want to. 
4500	I do know that community service is great for helping other people or just cleaning around 
4501	but some students do not want to do it and some have sports or other things to worry about and i just think it could cause so much stress to students. 
4502	Community service should come from the heart no because one is obligated to do it , at least what you should do is tell the students that community service will give you extra credit , i am sure that many students will join immediately just because of that. 
4503	Here is one example why you should not make it mandatory for students to provide community service, well it would cause more stress to the students. 
4504	Most students stress about homework, work at school , grades ,sports ,etc. , if they are obligated to provide community service then that would be just another thing to stress about , and i am sure nor you or the parents want to see a stressed or depressed child. 
4505	Another reason is because if students do community service it is because they want to, in order for you to provide some community service it has to come from your heart 
4506	The majority of students that did not want to provide community service will hate it and some may even hate you. Some students might even leave the school because of that. Some rebellious students might even mess up the work that others have done in the community because they feel they do not have to work.  
4507	I can give you many ideas though on how to get students to provide community service with out any obligation. 
4508	For example provide a prize for the students that do more community service, that will have students provide more community service then they use to. Also you can give them extra credits for any class, the students will have credit for every day that they provide community service, the credits begin to stock up and the students will have the option to choose any class/subject that they want or need those extra credits for. 
4509	As you can see i have some good reasons on why you should not make it mandatory, but if you feel like students need to provide more community service then use some of my ideas. As a student i think that if use you use at least one of those ideas that i stated then more students would join. 
4510	it not only benifits congress it aso benifits the president who is running to be our leader as well and also our electors 
4511	Due to the fact that we live in America, where we have the choice of choosing what we would like to do, (most of the time), I due believe that students should have the right to choose weather or not they want to participate in community service 
4512	I do, however, want to sate the fact that if we do choose to do community service that our world would be a much better place. 
4513	I don't, however, believe in forcing people to do something they don't have to do. 
4514	On the other hand. if we do community service, we would get jobs done much faster. 
4515	If we helped out the people, it wouldn't only be a nice thing to do, but you could get some benefits as well. 
4516	Maybe they'd offer you a job or you may just feel good about helping your fellow community members. 
4517	That trash will add up and become a huge heap of trash. It's not healthy for you. the plants, or the animals. just imagine what could happen if a small animal ate something that was toxic to them. That wouldn't be good at all. 
4518	So just keep in mind that community service is a great thing to do, but if some people don't want to, you shouldn't force them. 
4519	In the United States, every student is required to receive a K-12 education. Since technology has become such a big aspect of people's lives, many schools have started to offer online classes. This means that students have the ability to attend their classes from home. With the ability to learn from home, people have started to discuss whether or not this opportunity is beneficial for students 
4520	schools create a good environment for face-to-face help 
4521	there are less distractions in schools, 
4522	schools promote projects to improve life skills.  
4523	First, students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because schools create a good environment for face-to-face help 
4524	Although technology has made many daily tasks easier, school is a place that shouldn't be taken lightly, and has endless advantages. One of the biggest advantages of taking classes at school is being able to receive help from peers and teachers whenever a student needs it. This may not seem like much, but having the opportunity to get face-to-face help whenever it's necessary can make a big difference on a student's academic success. Not to mention, there are minimal distractions in school that make learning easier than at home. 
4525	Next, students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because there are less distractions in schools. 
4526	A student's home is a place for relaxation and minimal work. When a person thinks about relieving stress at the end of the day, they think about going home. At home, it's easy to get distracted by the little things. It may just be a pet or the TV, but all of these things result in taking important learning time away from a student's day. At school, a student doesn't have time to get distracted. Lessons are taught and good amounts of work are assigned so a student stays busy. For example, if a student that learns from home has to write an essay, they are more likely to get distracted by the things in their home then get it done. However, a student that learns at school would get their essay done, knowing that it's easier to stay on task then get behind because of distractions. Having less distractions isn't the only positive of learning at school though. A student also gets to work on projects that will help them in their future lives. 
4527	Lastly, students would not benefit from learning from home because learning at school pushes students to do projects, which improve life skills 
4528	Projects have always been a way for students to collaborate with their peers. It may not seem like much, but projects teach teamwork, leadership, and knowledge skills. Projects also emphasize the importance of making friends and compromising with others to achieve success. Learning from home deprives students from working with their peers. The only way a student gets to be in contact with another person is if a student is video conferencing a teacher or staff member. 
4529	Attending classes from home makes it easier for students to get an education without having to commute to schools. Not to mention, if a student didn't have to commute to school, they would have more free time to do extracurricular activities. 
4530	However, students would not benefit from learning from home because schools offer face-to-face help, minimal distractions, and project-based learning that helps students learn essential life skills. 
4531	Even, after reading the passage, I don't believe that driverless cars should be a reality right now.  Maybe in a few years, when changes are made for safety precautions, but in the now, we can handle driving on our own. 
4532	"Having the ""smart roads"" equipped with electrical cable or magnets, as General Motors and Berkeley engineers did in paragraph 3, would never work with rebuilding all new roads all over the world just for these cars. "
4533	But no matter how many sensors, lasers, or recievers you have on this driverless car, artificial intelligence will never be as smart as human intelligence. 
4534	What will happen when a deer jumps out from a field, a pedestrian rides his bike, a child's ball bounces out from her yard, or a pothole comes near comes bouncing from her yard? Will the sensors and lasers notice the change and react as fast a human would?  Even if there is still a driver in the seat, as said in paragraph 8, what will keep their attention on the road and not fixated on their phone or other passengers?  No amount of buzzing or flashing lights will get the attention of the driver to whatever accident may occur quick enough to make a change.  If anything, the displays will make the driver panic in such a way that will make their safety decline further. 
4535	Driverless cars are especially targeted to keep those who would normally drive while under the influence of alchohol and others safe from them. 
4536	having driverless cars in the world would not be nearly as safe as human intelligence.  The driverless cars will be more of a distraction on to the passengers and essentially, will not help any of the passengers nor pedestrians around them.  There are much too many scenarios that could go wrong rather than if a human driver was actually in control. 
4537	Well, I think that students should have community service because it will help people and make them feel happy. 
4538	If you go to the nursing home and help the old people, they will feel very good. 
4539	If you pick up trash from the side of the road, then people in the community will think that you did a good job. 
4540	Their children might not come and visit them and help them. So they want to be really happy if their about to die or their really sick. You will also feel good after you do something good for them. 
4541	What will they think? They'll probably think that the students or adults don't do anything for the community. So not just juveniles should pick up the trash for the community. High school students and adults should just volunteer to pick up trash on the side of the road. instead of getting paid for it. 
4542	So why shouldn't students and adults that don't have jobs do the volunteer work. We should be really nice to the community because its a great place to live at. We should also be nice to the old people because their old, some are sick, and some might die soon. 
4543	I would say that we keep the Electoral College because it has worked over the past century so why change it now. 
4544	The people voting don't always know what they want in a president they might be undecided and just choose the best looking one 
4545	I mean yeah some have their facts straight and know how the president they are voting is going to help the united states become a better country overall 
4546	When people have to much freedom they don't know what to do and do wrong choices so i think choosing a elector is a good thing they have studied the president and have heard countless promises that he has done. I mean he or she most likley will vote for the candiate running for president you did because he or she is a elector he or she gets the people who also voted for the same person as he or she wants. 
4547	"By this the number is much smaller since each country is weighed and is worth certain points and decided by electors you choosed to trust to vote for the same president you did. You still are in control just that you choose somebody he/her is not likely to change his or her mind and vote for the exact person you want he or she to vote for. It stated in the article that ""Each candidate running for president in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candiate's politcal party."" I say that if the candidate political party chooses the electors then they must be good and the party must be sure the elector won't change his mind out of no where. "
4548	This does make the candiate running for president try to convience the electors he is the one they need and that he will help our country be better. This also helps the candiate running for president know what states he should go to since some states they already know they lost 
4549	"It stated in the article that ""A solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the south,has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his plurality in states that he knows he will win.""So this keeps the president from having to go to every state because its just no based of popular vote and want every individual person votes for. "
4550	My main suggestion for you first and foremost is to try giving out a survey to all of the students that attend your school.  The main reason I say this is so that you know what your students mainly do with their day.  And so you know whether or not they have time to attend this community service.  
4551	In my opinion, i think you should make all students perform some type of community service. 
4552	I think this is a good idea so that students will be more involved in their community 
4553	and so that our community will become a better one.  
4554	To me I think we should change the election by popular vote for the president 
4555	it is considered a non-democratic method for selecting a president, and it is all up to the electors of a candidate. The Electoral College should also be changed to popular vote because it is not the people who are choosing the president, it is the three electors sent from each different state. 
4556	The Electoral College should also be changed to election by popular vote, because people consider it non-democratic. This is because the voting is all up to the electors selected by each of the different states, meaning that the actual people of the state have no power in the election of the candidates for president. 
4557	When the people of the state take their vote for the candidates they are actually voting for potential electors who will then go represent the selected candidate, this gives rise to problems like corrupt electors who are dishonest and using cheating tactics, also most states know that their votes will do nothing to help the candidates being represented, examples would be the Democrats in Texas and the Republicans in California. 
4558	To conclude this letter, I again say that the Electoral College should be changed to election by popular vote because, popular vote is fairer then the Electoral College, the people have no power compared to the electors and the are subject to corruption with in the system. 
4559	I as a student here at your school do not think students should be forced to do community service 
4560	We do not have enough time, 
4561	some of us are not capable 
4562	this would put to much power in the hands of the school. 
4563	When practice starts we would have to be doing service and coaches would become very angry as well as the students because of missed practices. If we have test the next day at school and we have to do well on it to pass the class we might not be able to because we were being forced to do service.  Just because of you we would fail our classes and our sports. 
4564	The have broken arm or ankle and can't really do anything. Also some are not all there mentally and would probably hurt more than they helped. So then instead of trying to help our town you hurt it because you force unfit students to do service. 
4565	Our schedules are all ready revolve around school and this would make it way to difficult for us. We have the right do what we want under restraints of the law according to the law. The school does not have the right to force us to do community service. 
4566	The Electoral College is not a place but a process. The Electoral College process consists of the slection of the electors. 
4567	I honestly think driverless cars are an unproductable invention and can cause danger. 
4568	It seems to me that it may or will cause alot more accidents than texting while driving or drinking while driving. 
4569	For example, say if there are driverless cars in the future, and you or a group of friends are going on a road trip. The car is on auto pilot and you are drinking or texting, reading, listening to music, and/or perhaps sleeping. The car may not signal or warn you that their is traffic, or on road construction uphead. The car may cause you to get in trouble for not paying attention and taking control when neccassary, and/or may cause a horrbile accident. This can and will cause conflict between you and the manufacturer. This can cause a huge debate on driverless cars ; are they dependent and reliable enough or are self service cars safer?. 
4570	Driverless cars may indeed help those who are in need of going from one place to another such as senior citizens, legally blind, etc. 
4571	But it may also put them in danger without them knowing. Another example, if you are a handicap, legally blind, or deaf, you may be in grave danger. The car again is on autopilot and is driving through a neighborhood and there are signs everywhere to when and where to stop, if there is construction, or there are people crossing the streets. You come to a stop at a stop sign, you are not paying attention, you are oblivious to your surroundings when doing other things. The car will go head but there is a car coming from the other side of the street where there is no stop sign. You and the other person collide. 
4572	the car is supposed to be an upgrade, advanced in technology. The car has sensors to sense if there is danger 
4573	but the car may have a flaw. This again will bring conflict and debate. This can lead people to believe that driverless cars are unsafe and unproductive and is a liabilty. But say you were paying attention to your surroundings, instictively, you would look left and right. The car will go foward but, there is a car coming from the other side (remember there is no stop sign for the other car to stop at) you and that person collide. Again, the car is to have warned you but if you were alert, you would have taken control of the car when driving through a neighborhood. 
4574	Either way to me, driverless cars are dangerous no matter what. There not industructible and cannot always be depended on. They may be smart and advance but even the greatest technology can be a danger and liability. 
4575	"Most people hear the word ""Electoral College"" and think that it is a place.. But they're wrong, it is a process. The Electoral College is widely regarded as a thing that seems to belong to the past and not to fit in the present. The advocates whom are conflicting with others are saying that the Electoral College method isn't democratic in modern day society, which is correct. The Electoral College is a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens which was founded by the founding fathers. "
4576	Though most people would be disgusted by the idea of picking up trash at the beach or helping out at retirement home, 
4577	I think that all kids should do community service to make their lives and the community a better place. 
4578	For example, most of the movies or television shows people see, it always revolves around doing the right thing and making the right decision, but when the teenagers really come face to face with community service, most of the would be either annoyed or disgusted. 
4579	"They would think that doing community service takes too much time away from what they think they ""need"" to do or what they want to do "
4580	But have they ever thought about what a better community they would live in if they did community service? 
4581	For instance if you love the beach, don't you just hate it when you just want to lie on the beach and relax or go surfing but always have to be around great number of sea gulls picking at trashes next to you and being pelted bye plastic bags in the waves? If the children of our generation loves the beach so much, they should just pick up the trash they found-or even threw themselves-then everyone can enjoy a happy and clean ecosystem/community. 
4582	Doing community helps everyone, including oneself and the ones around them. 
4583	Especially since the children in this generation have been introduced to so many violent and/or inappropriate video games, television shows, and movies-whose only focus is to add excitement and get maximum audiences and money-they are bound to be corrupted, so in doing community service, it can right the wrong of the improper way of life that had been inflicted upon us by the media of today, the same media that would show and/ or sell anything in order to get the maximum audience and make the most money possible and have never thought about the consequences that would have in the future of the United States. 
4584	Voters cannot control whom their electors are, in the chance that those electors are replaced with new electors so the votes may be rigged 
4585	"""faithless"" electors may refuse to vote for their party's candidate and could cast a deciding vote for whomever they please. "
4586	Voters don't actually vote for the president, instead, they vote for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president 
4587	In the case that you vote John Kerry in Texas, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry. In the case those electors won the statewide election, they would go to Congress and Kerry would get 34 electoral vote. Who are the electors? They could be anyone, even if their not holding office. Who even picks these electors in the first place? Sometimes it state conventions, other times it's the state's central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can we, citziens of the United States, control whom their electors vote for? Not always, and that shouldn't be.  
4588	In the 1960 election, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature almost succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy and make it seem that a popular vote would have not gone to Kennedy. What would happen if their was a tie in the electoral vote? The case would be thrown in the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. Becasue each state counts for only one vote, a single representative from Wyoming would represent 500,000 voters, 55 representatives from California who getto represent 55 representatives would have as much say as the one from Wyoming. 
4589	Now when have you changed your mind about something? Electors can do the same. Electors can refuse to vote for their party's candidate and vote for whomever they please 
4590	"That can't be right, yet it has happened plently of times before. It's even unfair to the people, who sometimes don't even get to see their electors. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, they don't focus of states they know they cannot win, aiming towards ""swing states."" In the 2000 campaign, 17 states didn't see their candidates at all, as well as 25 of the largest media markets who didn't get to see not one campaign ad.  "
4591	The development of driverless cars would be an amazing thing.  So many bad situations could be avoided with driverless cars because the human drving a car is an enormous variable.  The payoff of using driverless cars would be giant as well.  Granted, it would be expensive and the period of time it would take to completely phase out regular cars would be lengthy, it would be a worthwhile investment into the future. 
4592	The development of driverless cars would be an amazing in incredibly helpful step for society and the car manufacturing world. 
4593	Every year hundreds of thousands of people are killed in car accidents.  Many of those accidents are a result of neglegence on the fault of the driver.  Driving while under the influence, driving and texting, driving and making calls, driving and eating, driving and putting make-up on; all are things that cause car accidents that could be avoided with driverless cars. With driverless cars, passengers would be able to go on the road and not have to deal with the stress that comes with driving around on busy roads, or the stress that comes with taking into consideration bad drivers, other people driving under the influence, or just other drivers in general. 
4594	Driverless cars would eliminate the biggest variable regarding cars: the driver. 
4595	A driverless car would be beneficial to many people, but they would be even more beneficial to the companies and factories that construct and sell the cars. 
4596	Driverless cars would change the way the world works. 
4597	"There would be no ""new driver anxiety"" when teens get their liscenses.  There would be a dramatic decrease in the death-by-vehicle statistics.  It would not be suprising if one day people no longer needed to buy cars, similar to the article when Sergey Brian said, ""...such cars would change the world."".  There are so many options that arise when considering such an invention.  What is a city decided to have fleets of taxis and buses with driverless cars?  Driverless cars would be an added benefit.  Then no one would have top buy a car and spend the money to take car of it with upkeep, and car companies would still make a lot of money.  With driverless cars, the impact on the environmet would be very much less than those cars of today.  The options and pros are endless when it comes to driverless cars.  The world would experience a shift in function if driverless cars were introduced.  The number of deaths and accidents involving automotives would decrease exponetially and life would be a little less stressful for many.  The attack on the environment would be lessened, and roads would be safer. "
4598	There are pros and cons for any situation, but in the case of driverless cars, the pros seem to greatly outweigh the cons.  The quality of life would increase, and the variable of the human driver would be eliminated. Driverless cars would be an excellent addition to the car lots and would be an amazing tool for people in everyday life. 
4599	The electrol college system is an unfair system, people don't have the right to select their own president, they dont have the right to select a president. 
4600	Because, when people vote they are technically voting for the electors for a candited. That candidate can be a democratic or a republican. 
4601	In source two it states that electors can choose there opposing candidate. Which declines the the whole voting process. Why do we vote? we vote to select a leader who will defend this coutry and make america a place of oppurtunity. 
4602	"The most important reason why the electrol cllege is unfair because of the "" winners it take all"" rule. "
4603	Each state gets one vote and then the electors can choose who they want for president. In source two it states that the electoral college consists of 538 electors and the most amont of elecrtoral votes is 270, in order to pick an president. Also in source two it states that the number of electors we have equals to the amount of members of congress we have. I propose a new system by only letting the American people select our president by votes counted all up by each state, for example if we didn't have have electoral college,  then it would be a fair vote because people votes would count the number that adds up with all votes for one candidates that will oppose another candidates and there would be technically no tie it would either ,more or less, but if we still had the electoral college then the vote would not be equally fair becuse if the majority of a state for examlpe  chose republican candidate, then that would be vague becuse some people choose democratic and there vote did not really count. but without the electoral collge, than everyones vote counts and each candidates gets vote from every one, not only electoral. 
4604	"for example if one state candidate was choosen for republican and they were ""faithless"" as it says in source two, and chose the democratic party it would be very unfortunate for the republicans because than there would be no point of the votes the republican supporters have voted for. It only comes once every four years, this is very important to the american people, on choosing who they want for the future of america. "
4605	In conclusion,  the state senators should eliminate the electoral collge because they count the majorty votes, and don't count other votes that is not popular as the other candidates vote. also because they can decide vote on an canditate they want based on their opinions and beliefs. and lastly because of the winner takes it all system which is bascially taking the losing candidates electoral votes.    
4606	in our day and time we have smart phones and aindroids that we can use to vote for the president in the peoples choice. there could be a web site that you can go on to submit your election and at the end of the election the compuster can tally us the number of votes to the exact amount so it would be the peoples choice. its  also outdated becouse we dont need one or a few guys to be sent somewhere to cast the vote of the people , we have so mmusch advanced technology that we can have any legal person who wants to vote can and actually have there vote matter insted of what the elector pick so it matters to those few poeple instead of every single person in america. 
4607	When driverless cars are made, people might start texting while the car is driving thinking they're still safe when they could still be in danger 
4608	Since it is computer what if hackers hijacked it? Or maybe it messed up because its computer made and the driver has no control? 
4609	I understand your reasoning for the new change you would like to undertake, but I am against his issue. Many students in our school love to play sports, and other fun activities, but also many students are getting C averages or below as their grades 
4610	Kids that are doing so for example should not be restricted from school activities like so just because of their grades, the should be helped. 
4611	A possible solution is requiring the child stay after school for extra help with teachers, or if that is not possible, encourage small help sessions in class. A child may not be the brightest in school, but may be the best on the basketball team. It is not fair to them to take away something that is amusing for them, or lets them have fun. Their struggling with school isn't going to change if you just take away more privileges. The child needs help. And what i believe may happen is sometimes the child will even start doing worse, or stop focusing as much because he/she is angry and sad they have no privileges other than to focus on their school work more and try harder 
4612	Most of these reasons are to occur if you take these activities away from children with averages of a C or less. On the other hand, if you start having after school sessions, then the child will start to succeed, and will be having fun participating in their activities. 
4613	There are many people who agree with me 
4614	Over sixty percent of the vters would like a more direct system of voteing (according to a Gallup poll in 2000). And so did Ritchard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and AFL-CIO. 
4615	The main reason why people want a change is for all the qurks in the Electoral College system. 
4616	For example, if you lived in Texas. And you wanted to vote for John Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electoers. Witch in most cases would be O.K., but they could betray the party and vote for whom they please. It doesn't always happen but the possibility is real.  And people, like the segregationists back in 1960, could have gone agenst their party and pick electors to go agenst Kennedy. 
4617	Dear Senator I am not in favor of keeping the Electoral College. We should not keep the Electoral College for many reasons. 
4618	Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all agreed on one thing, and it was abolishing the Electoral College. 
4619	Another reason being, under the Electoral College System, voters vote for a slate of electors, not the president and in return they select the president 
4620	Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all agreed on one thing, and it was aboloshing the Electoral College. 
4621	"This was also agreed upon by many other citizens. According to a Gallup Poll in 2000, which was taken shortly after Al Gore won the popular vote, but lost the popular vote. According to the poll ""over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election not  the kind we have now."" It is said that ""this year voters are to expect another close election in which the popular vote winner could again loose the presidency."" "
4622	"All of the ""winner-takes-all"" systems in each state, canidates do not spend time in each states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states."" In fact in the 2000 campaing there were seventeen states the did not see the canidates at all and it was said that voters in 25 of the largest media markets did not even get to see a single campaign ad. "" if anyone has a good arguement for putting he fate of the presidency in the hands of a few swing voters in ohio, they have yet to make it...."" "
4623	As you can see I am in favor of changing the elctoral college to election by popular vote for the president of the United States of America. Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all agreed on one thing, and it was aboloshing the Electoral College. Under the Electoral College System they vote not for the president but for a state of electors who in return elect the president. Last but not least, the Electoral College is just unfair in so many differnt ways. These are reasons why I am not in favor of the Electoral College but in the favor to elect by popular vote for the president of the United States of America.      
4624	The Electoral College is an outdated system of voting. There are few weak reasons why it should be carried out as the nations voting process. The United States of America should change to election by popular vote for the presidency. 
4625	Admmitedely, the winner take all system is a fair way of deviding the votes. 
4626	"In the first article ""What Is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal Register, the author asserts, ""Most states have a 'winner-take-all' system that awards all the electors to the winning presidential candidate."" If a presidential candidate spends alot of time, effort, and money in a campaign for a ""swing"" state; he should be awarded all the votes for winning that state. It is a high risk but high reward to spend all that time and money to only earn sixty percent of the votes. That is why a ""winner-take-all"" is crucial. To add on, the author of the first article mentions, ""Each candidate running for President in your state has his or her own group of electors. The electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their responsibilities are..."" This is saying that a candidate chooses his or her electors, and you vote for the electors to then choose the candidate you voted for "
4627	However; the people should have the right to directly choose the candidate of his or her choice. Therefore, the elecoral college is outdated and must be eliminated.  
4628	"To start off, Bradford Plumer the author of ""The indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" states, ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" "
4629	Every vote counts. But why make a vote more powerful than another. Citizens shouldn't be given a special vote just because they were chosen by the candidates party. 
4630	"Additionally, Plumer explains, ""If you lived in texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for [John] Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry."" Why should kerry earn 34 electoral votes. He should earn the amount of voters in that state he persuaded to vote for him. He should not earn the electoral votes of all the people that did not think he was the best presidential candidate. Every vote should count, and that is why the electoral college should be eliminated.  "
4631	"Secondly, Plumer claims ""Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. (The senate would choose the vice-president.) Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represnt 35million voters."" This method is rediculous. "
4632	A state with one representative should not have the equal amount of power as a state with 55. If popular vote is made the way of electing then the odds of a tie would be nearly impossible. 
4633	"Also Plumer adds, ""Al Gore-thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency."" This means more people thought he was better suited to be the President of the United States, but Bush won because of the ""quirks"" of the electoral college. All in all, the electoral college is unfair, and creates more problems then popular vote. "
4634	The United States of america should change from the electoral college to popular vote. The outcome would be better for the country, and fairer to the candidates. That is why the electoral college should be eliminated.    
4635	A while back the founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of quallified citizens. 
4636	I think that keeping electoral college would be a great idea for many reasons, we have had the electoral college for many years now and it has been great it has many good benifits to it. 
4637	One of the reasons the electoral college must stay is that the will be a certainty of the outcomes, they will know exacty what will be coming out as a result instead of being uncertain for example(source 1) 
4638	Another good reason why the elctoral college is a good idea is that it balances the state votes. 
4639	"Imagine this scenario: a person is faced with the future--new developments that may lead into the next era of technology. The question now is, should that person deny it or gladly accept it? If that person were me, I'd take it, as there is no point in staying the past and be outdated, and this is exactly how I see driverless cars. The problem now becomes, however, whether this technology is ""the future"" or not. "
4640	The problem is actually efficency. 
4641	"To demonstrate this, for power to reach a house from a faraway power plant, much more electricity is generated than needed as to make sure it can travel the long distance in cables without losing so much charge that the current becomes weak and useless, and a logical fix for such a problem would be to simply figure out a way to move the power source closer as to achieve higher efficencies. This same logic applies to cars in traffic, which use a lot of fuel to do essentially nothing. When I saw in the article ""Driveless Cars Are Coming"" that Google cofound Sergey Brin--who must be very intelligent as he IS the cofounder of Google, a very widely known and used company--said that these cars would use half the fuel of today's taxis AND offer far more flexibility than a bus, my only logical reaction was that this is a wonderful technology. "
4642	Transitioning to errors, a common theme of accident tragedies is the one where a person is texting and driving leading to distractions that cause the accident. This is not the only cause of accidents, though, as humans are not made to be perfect, small errors also cause accidents, but despite the wide range of things that may cause an accident, driverless cars can cover a person for that as well. 
4643	"My first piece of evidence for this is that driverless cars are machines, and despite having a notoriously bad reputation for failing at times due to some error during the design process, machines do not tire and do not grumble about watching their surroundings; they also need not be perfect, only better than a person to become favorable as a driver. My second piece of evidence comes from, once again, ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" when it was stated that ""enetertainment and information systems that use heads up displays [...] can be turne doff instantly when the driver needs to take over [in the case that the car senses that its own computing devices are not enough to handle a situation]"". This system appealed to me a lot due to how intuitive it is; if a person shouldn't be using something, it turns off, no questions asked. All of these factors further lead me to believe that cars are ""the way of the future"". "
4644	despite all of these factors there are both criptics and critics for driverless cars. 
4645	Some reasons usually brought up that haven't been addressed yet are the issues of laziness with the animated movie WALL-E coming to mind 
4646	the hacking of the systems that run these driverless cars, which is equally terrifying. 
4647	hacking is commonly a misunderstood phenonenon. The aboslute requirement for all hacking is access to the device that someone wishes to hack usually through some internet connection on the device linked to other functions. This is easily remedied through the use of local software on the driverless car, cutting it off from the internet as well as making the entertainment and information systems independent of the driving system. 
4648	Getting back to the first issue about laziness, people are still sitting down whether in a driverless car or a conventional car and that these cars will likely be extremely expensive with all the added sensors for the foreseeable future, encouraging walking as an alternative to money as well as creating a walking trend so that when these technologies are cheaper, laziness would not become a problem. 
4649	I support and adore the idea of driverless cars as they are a way to support using energy more efficently rather than going out of the way to make new sources of energy; they are a way to reduce the unnecessary ending of lives as well as unecessary drama from automobile accidents (especially for me since I'm a very accident prone person); and last but not least, they are a way to promote regular walking and get automobile internet security right. After looking through all of this, I can say for certain that driverless cars will certainly be a huge advantage to our society if only we'd give them a chance because after all, everything deserves a chance and a second for making up for its mistakes.   
4650	The Electoral College is a controversial topic in the US. This is the system used to elect the president of the United States, but most people (60% of Americans, according to source 1) believe that we shouldn't use this particular system and that we should go with the popular vote instead, while all others are strong in their stance that we should continue its use 
4651	Under the Electoral College, it is entirely possible for a Presidential Candidate to win presidency, even with the majority of voters voting for the oposing candidate. We should discard the Electoral College in favor of the popular vote.  
4652	 The Electoral College is a system that allots a certain amount of electoral votes to each state. Each state is given 2 electoral votes plus another amount of votes which depends on that state's population. The amount of votes ranges from 3 to 55 (source 3). A candidate must recieve 270 out of 538 possible votes. The candidate the electoral votes of a state go to is decided by the majority vote of each individual state. In all states but Maine and Nebraska give a candidate the entirety of their votes if the majority of its citizen votes for them (source 1) 
4653	Some people don't even bother voting due to the fact that their vote will not contribute to their favored candidate's election. This happens often when a democratic voter lives in a republican state, and vice versa (source 3) 
4654	Many people stand by the Electoral College as the best course of action. They argue that the certainty of the winner is better, a candidate can't win the election due to regional favor, and this system unsures that there will still be a clear winner even when each candidate recieves the same percentage of votes. 
4655	We began using the Electoral College in order to ensure that states with low populations weren't ignored by presidential campaigns 
4656	Presidential candidates focus their attention to swing states, in order to win their electoral votes. Candidates have little to no need to campaign in states that have a majority of one party, because their vote is either a lost cause or all but garunteed. If this system does not do the job that it was originally intended for, then why do we continue to use it? 
4657	In conclusion, the electoral college is ineffective and outdated. we should no longer use this as a system of defining our president. Even though a winner is often more clear, there is still a possibility of a tie between candidates. People who support the Electoral College also argue that its a good thing due to swing states having more attention payed to them and therefore being more careful in their decision. However, this reasoning is flawed in that it assumes that citizens of a state are more likely to inform theirselves thouroughly simply because their vote holds more value, in a sense. Also, candidates would no longer pay special attention to swing states if the electoral college weren't in place so the votes of these citizens wouldn't be held above the rest. Increased value of votes is not a good thing, which this argument also assume. It is the best decision to abolish the Electoral College.   
4658	Arguements on whether the state senator should favor in keeping the Electoral College or change to election by popular vote for the president of the United States are occuring today. 
4659	Each favor has its advantages and disadvantages, but we should favor in keeping the Electoral College 
4660	because less disputes are likely to happen 
4661	not voting will not effect the election.  
4662	On the other hand, changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States has some advantages. 
4663	"In ""Source 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"", author Bradford Plumer claims ""the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational"" because ""candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning."" This means that the candidates focus on the ""tight races of the 'swing' states."" To continue, Plumer also argues that changing to election by popular vote makes every vote count "
4664	however, chaning to election by popular vote will cause mant disputes and it is not the right way to keep everyone satisfied with voting for a new president. Keeping the Electoral College is more realistic. 
4665	"In ""Source 3: In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"", author Richard A. Posner explains that the Electoral College ""restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution."" The Electoral College gives larger states more attention from presidential candidates as opposed to a smaller state. Posner continues the idea with ""the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election."" To break it down, voters who pay close attention to the campaign will be the most thoughtful voters and they will recieve the most attention from the candidates. This reduces the amount of disputes because the presidential candidates will decide on who to give the most attention to. "
4666	"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"", author Richard A. Posner states that ""knowing [the voters'] vote has no effect [gives them] less incentitive to pay attention to the campaign."" But, ""voters in presidential electons are people who want to express  political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide and election."" This means thatchanging everyone to a single vote will have no effect, too because people will not put thought into who to vote, but they will just vote for whoever. "
4667	To conclude, the state senator should favor in keeping the Electoral College rather than changing to election be popular vote for the president of the United States because less disputes will occur and not participating will not be effective.           
4668	Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the AFL-CIO have all agreed on abolishing the electoral college, and so do I! 
4669	i think since that we live in a good/bad community i think it would be good to help out the environment, or help younger individuals get a better education. Other community services require like babysitting, donating food, or donate money, not all community services are long and time wasting. 
4670	i recommend that everyone does community service even if the students don't want to, its good for the environment, 
4671	If we did do community service more people would come to this town and that means more students and more money for the school! 
4672	which means we could improve some of the things this school lacks, like more space in the rooms, and a larger cafeteria. The schools budget would be sky rocketing. So were pretty much doing each other a favor like a i scratch your back, you scratch mine.  
4673	Many would seem to object to the thought of having to maintain a B average to participate in sports, but I for one, agree. 
4674	Students may take it as unfair, but they do not realize that without education, they have nothing. 
4675	"To get into better universities, they will not accept grades that are not exceptional, let alone standard. I believe these students are trying to ""just get by"" in their class work, leading them to become irresponsible, lazy, and completely oblivious to the fact that the better jobs out there require more than a ""standard"" degree. Most school athletes believe that right out of high school, they will be drafted into a professional sports career, and for some, it is true. However, the statistics of ever making it into a professional league is slim, and for those who don't make it, and sadly don't care about their education, and end up getting a job that pays little to none and wishing that they did what they were supposed to do in school. "
4676	A lot of the time, my fellow students think that average is good enough, and it's sad to say that I know that some of them won't do well out of school. 
4677	I do understand that there are students who just don't understand the work, 
4678	but a lot of the time, they don't get help with it, making harder on them self. 
4679	Honestly, if you expect to do sports and get a good education, a C is not good enough.  
4680	If students want to have fun they should want to get their grades up. We teens and pre-teens anticipate so much from the everyone and everything, but we don't understand when our parents or teachers want us to succeed. 
4681	Election by popular vote is fair in both ways they give the people a chances to pick who they want and who will make a difference to our country. 
4682	studies show that five out of ten students are more distant just by taking classes from home. Being in a school can improve your communication skills that can be used in interviews, presentations, performances, or even if your just speaking to family or friends. It's one of the most important thing you'll need in life. Taking online classes at home is a totally different environment then being at school. At home you only have a few people you can talk to for help which could be your parents, family, or your teacher. School is different you have students everywhere, teachers, and friends that can help you with anything such as personal problems, injuries, and school work. Being at school can help you learn more life lessons then being at home. 
4683	I'm a scientist at NASA and the Face, a lot of people seem to think was formed by aliens or is proof of alien life forms, is actually just a natural landform 
4684	For many students, missing school can be something that can put a wrench in their progress. Out of school, students miss assignments, lectures, and tests, which can be detrimental to their grades and their overall GPA. Some schools have decided to use distance learning as an alternative to missing school, by allowing their students to attend a class from home using video chats or conference calls, when they are at home. 
4685	Having the option to attend class at home has many benefits for students, and would help to raise many students GPA's, due to the flexibility that the distance learning would offer. 
4686	Some students have low immune systems, and are sick often throughout the entire school year. Because of the fact that we would fall behind, many students will go to school no matter how sick, in order to attend class and keep their grades up. This leads to overall low performance, and low sanitation, as germs from the sick students will be on everything that they touch. Those who do stay home however, have to go back to school and make up every missed assignment, test, quiz, and homework for each class that they miss. Some schools have eight periods in a day, meaning that the student would fall behind in all of their classes. Make up work takes a lot of time and piles up quicker than many think, and staying on top of old and new subjects can overwhelm some 
4687	If given the option to attend classes from home, more students would stay home and get the rest that they need in order to be healthy, because they would have an opportunity to stay on top of school, and not fall behind the rest of their class. 
4688	One other benefit for students would be for those who have family emergencies pop up. 
4689	Everyone has them, students and faculty alike. Some families live out of state or in other countries, causing students to be forced to miss weeks at a time. Throughout these weeks, the students would miss many lectures, assignments, tests, quizzes and important projects. Allowing those who are gone to stay on top by using a computer, would allow students to focus more on their family in a time of worry, instead of worrying how they are going to make up their test in their third period math class. The stress of having a family emergency on top of the already extremely stress inducing schoolwork, can become too much for many, leaving them exhausted and unable to catch up. The inability to catch up for some, can cause them to drop out of school all together, as the stress and pressure would build and build up. This can ruin students' futures and take a lot of opportunities out of their hands. 
4690	Furthermore, a lot of students live further away from the school, and a lot of the time, rely on the bus to get to and from school. On days where the student were to sleep in late, or the bus doesn't come, the student would have to stay home and miss class. While some have the option to ask a relative for a ride, others do not, causing issues at home and at school for those who are unable to make it due to transportation issues. 
4691	Being given the option to work on school at home, students would not have to rush to find a ride if the bus doesn't show, and waking up late for the bus would not be as big of an issue 
4692	On the other hand, some argue that students will use the distance learning less as a tool, but more as a crutch, so that they don't have to attend classes and can stay home whenever they want. People believe that the longer that students are required to show up and are given less options to make it up at home ,the more drive to show up at school will be seen. 
4693	Distance learning is one of the best tools that could be used for those who need it. Life is full of bumps and turns that some do not always expect. These bumps and turns can take students out of the classroom and cause them to fall behind their peers. Stress and loss of the drive to learn are linked, and can be seen in any classroom no matter where. Throughout the years, technology has grown and evolved. Instead of complaining about the evolution of technology, teachers and parents should be able to embrace it, and the tools that it brings students. Distance learning has many more benefits than downsides and downfalls. More schools should implement it, to adjust and accommodate to the students' needs, instead of the students having to adjust their needs for the school system. 
4694	It's more convenient to just hitch a ride from someone such as a friend or a taxi. But sometimes those aren't always the most convenient options. Taxi drivers could take someone anywhere or your friend could be under the influence. Driverless cars are safer because they could take you where you need to go safely. They are also more convenient because sometimes people could be impaired and unable drive, so they would just have a driverless car pick them up instead. This way, it is convenient for people to travel without worrying if they are going to be safe or not. 
4695	Next, the electoral college is unfair to voters because of th winner take all system. In each the candidates don't spend their time in the states that have no chance of winning. 
4696	"So in conclusion it is not a alien made face it simply in a mesa or a landmark on Mars. The proof is in the article when you see the 3 picutes that were taken to prove it wasn't a alien made artifact. No matter how cool it would be if it was not to mention that it could make NASA famous or rich it just doesn't have the proof you need to be a alien artifact. If you look more into the passage it even says it was not a alien made artiffact. Yes this face was very famous it even says ""The ""Face"" on Mars has since been a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, apperered in books, magazines, and even radio shows."" (5). See how famous that face was 25 years ago is amazing but it still doesn't mean it was a alien made artiffact. So in final say it is not a alien made face and nor will there be enough proof its just a landmark on Mars that was very popular to people everywhere!           "
4697	Technological innovations have changed the way students learn. There are now more accessible and faster ways to acquire information for projects, homework, and for classroom learning. Computers, cell phones, and tablets are beginning to be used more and more by school systems .  These devices can be useful in the classroom, but they do not help with certain crucial aspects 
4698	it does not develop student's social skills 
4699	nor provide materials that are necessary for them to learn.  
4700	Students who attend classes from home do not benefit socially 
4701	Group work is important because students learn how to compromise, communicate, and get along with different types of people. If learning is done online, they miss out on the opportunity to develop their social skills. Social skills are necessary in day to day life since we are constantly interacting with other people such as bosses, coworkers, and strangers, for example, at a grocery store. Students should be able to develop those skills throughout their school years so they can be successful in the real world. 
4702	Moreover, classroom learning promotes comradery and friendships. Having friends in class makes learning more appealing and interesting. For example, debates and seminars develop critical thinking skills since other students can have a different, challenging perspective to share amongst each other about a topic; this causes them to respect each others opinions and promotes communication skills. 
4703	In addition, schools offer free materials and services that are not available at home 
4704	A copious amount of books are accessible in the school's library and can easily be checked out without the student needing to find transportation to the closest public library. Devices such as computers, printers, and laptops can be used by students to complete and turn in homework. Various teachers in schools have gone to college and are experienced in their subject and can go more in depth into learning material if a student did not understand it. Teachers can also explain topics in a way that allows all students to understand it since people learn things in different ways. For example, auditory and visual learners benefit from online classes more than students who prefer hands-on experiences. Schools also have enough funding to be able to provide outside-of-class learning such as field trips to museums and inviting guest speakers. 
4705	However, online classes can benefit students who have a busy life, are in need of credits, or decide that they want to take classes that interest them 
4706	Those types of classes allow students who need one or two more credits to graduate when they are supposed to rather than stay another year in school due to a few credits. For example, in IB schools, required classes, like a language class, may be taken online if the student's schedule does not allow them to fulfill that requirement since it is full. It is also possible for students to take online classes in the summer in order to make space on their schedule for next school year so that they can take classes that are intriguing to them. There are students who need to provide for their families at a young age but still want a high school diploma. Students who have jobs can take online classes with flexible times, so they can easily fit them into their daily life. 
4707	In conclusion, online classes do not benefit students since they do not develop social skills and allow for them to learn how to compromise effectively with others which is essential in the workplace. Materials such as laptops, books, and expert information is not easily accessible to a student that is learning online and is possibly going to cost money for them to obtain it. On the other hand, students who have to work in order to support their families benefit more from online learning. Students who only need a few credits to graduate or would like to be able to take non-required courses during school would benefit as well. Better technology has allowed students to be able to have the option of taking online classes, regardless of their personal obstacles, and promotes the importance of having a good education to all young adults.          
4708	"This systen includes various methods like the ""winner take all"" system that gives the presidency to the winning candinate of the eletors votes "
4709	One very important thing in this system is trust, you have to trust the electors that you voted for to make the right choice 
4710	This system of eletor votes is very useful for picking the country's leaders.  
4711	"The electoral votes decide who wil get what, who will win. Popular vote in no longer in ""session"" or popular, the electoral votes decide it now. For example, in the 2000 election, when Gore had a lot more popular votes than Bush, but Gore had less electoral votes, it was a shocking suprise for the nation, it seemed to be like more people liked Gore than Bush. One very important thing to consider is ... the reason why Bush won, there is a huge diffrence between making a good choice, aka Gore, and and making the right choice, aka Bush "
4712	Its very significant that you put your trust in the slate of people's hands that you and a whole variety of woried people selected. Trust should not just be handed oveer like anything, its should be earned just like respect, vote in the candinate that you trust. 
4713	Sometimes the electoral candinates vote against the people that elected for them and go for what they think is right which in no case is incorrect but a hudreds of citizens were counting on them to make their choice. We all have a voice, we have to use it in the fair way, and the righthous way is mostly a popular vote 
4714	popular vote is not as efficent as eletoral votes. 
4715	There has been some conterversy between whether we should keep the Electoral College or changing the election to popular vote for the president. There are pros and cons to each method of voting. The Electoral College has been around since the beginning of our country. Most of the time it is successful (there have been a few times problems have occured but rarely it happens). As time has passed and we enter a more modern age, people have started to feel that the Electoral College does not work and we should all switch to just a regular popular vote. 
4716	However, even though there have been a few problems in the past about this system, the Electoral College is still the best method of voting. 
4717	It is hard to argue that there are some problems with the Electoral College. 
4718	"""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" (Bradford Plumer). The public is starting to not like that their vote is not directly going toward the presidential vote but towards a group of electors that decide the fate of the presidency. ""the Electoral College method is not emocratic in a modern sense."" (Richard A Posner). The public is also starting to feel that this is not a true Democracy with this system. ""Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people."" (Bradford Plumer). The public is starting to not like that feeling that the electors can just turn on the public and not vote for what some people want (and it has happened a few times in the past). ""'faithless' electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please."" (Bradford Plumer). That is another worry of the public, no matter what party the elector belongs to, they can vote for anyone they want. ""Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the elcetion would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president.""(Bradford Plumer). The people are also not liking the fact that an elector representing a small amount of people has as much to say as an elector representing millions of people. All and all, it is hard to deny that there are a few problems with the electoral college and that this causes the public to worry come election time. "
4719	However, despite the worries and concerns that some people may have, the Electoral College is still the best method for voting. 
4720	"""The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote."" (the Office of the Federal Register). People must remember that this system is a compromise for the election and that any change could lead to problems among the government again. The public must also remember that ""each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee"".(Richard A. Posner). This system also can often prevent disputes. ""A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible...but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share or the popular vote."" (Richard A. Posner). Along with the fewer disputes, it also creates standards for the candidate. "" The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal...This is a desirable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president."" (Richard A. Posner). Another benefit to this system is that it causes voters to pay closer attention to the election. ""Voter in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign."" (Richard A. Posner). Along with the more aware voters, the Electoral College is also very beneficial to the big states. ""The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution."" (Richard A. Posner). And lastly, the Electoral Collee helps avoid run-off elections. ""There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner."" (Richard A. Posner). To sum it all up, there are many benefits to the Electoral College. "
4721	All and all, the Electoral College is the best way for voting. With this system, there are many benefits to the election process that people may not realize. With benefits like it avoids run-off elections and it makes the voters more aware, some people still beleive that a popular vote is still the best way. It is important to remember that there is a reason that we have certain methods, to benefit our country. And that is what the Electoral College is, a benefit to our country. So senator, and based on the evidence given, it is important to keep the Electoral College for all the benefits it brings and for the sake of our great nation that we live in.      
4722	Attending classes from home relieves school of its contributions to an individual, reminding us that the authenticity of a school institution cannot be replaced.  
4723	Schooling through the internet, especially from home, can cause students to lack essential life skills. 
4724	An example of an essential life skill would be communication. If a student is always talking to a professor from their home, they begin to lose their social skills needed to effectively communicate with new and ordinary people outside of home. This can cause awkward, short, and even meaningless conversations in the real world. Stemming from this, finding and making new friends becomes an issue that may take a long time to resolve. Workplace skills are also extremely important skills one can lack when attending classes from home. An educational institution progressively trains students with these skills, for they are necessary in order to succeed in performing well or getting a job. Having situations where these abilities are useful are mainly in the form of doing certain assignments with or without others, listening, maintaining eye contact, and being on time. Looking back, online schooling strips one of the ability to develop skills used in the real world. 
4725	Secondly, attending school from home by way of technology can be both physically and mentally damaging. 
4726	The idea of looking at a screen for hours on end is a concept that many schools tend to walk away from because it is not good for your eyes. While looking at a screen can be engaging, it is true that it causes major damage to one's eyes, especially if one were to look at a screen in the dark or when they first wake up. After long days of school at home, your eyes can start to irritate and become red, meaning the body may want a break. Online school, however, doesn't give the eyes the rest they need to function at maximum capacity, causing health problems in the long run. The technology needed for online conferencing can also ruin a student's ability to sleep well. Technology can be addicting and can keep students awake for long periods of time without rest. If students are attending online school for a few hours a day, use their phone for another few hours, and potentially engage in any other screen, they can lose sleep. Getting enough sleep for normal schooling is already a problem, so online school may not have the ability to fix that problem. The home is a comfort zone for everybody, but it can lead to a strict mental mindset. It doesn't allow people to grow to their fullest potential because they're at home most of the day, isolated from the rest of the world. One only grows by way of leaving your comfort zone, trying out new things, and going to other places. The mindset it can create can be a problem when moving on to other potentially important parts of life. The physical and mental association this type of schooling can have on a student can be devastating, to say the least. 
4727	Lastly, online or video conferences promote the development of bad habits 
4728	While schools have students pledge to an honor code, cheating is inevitable in almost very student to step foot in high school. Without the physical supervision of a teacher, cheating can become a staple in one's everyday school life, if it hasn't already. A student can potentially use an online source, secret notes, or another person in the room to help them with their assignments. Cheating is essentially a form of lying as well, which is a reason why it shouldn't be done. A second bad habit that could develop would be procrastination. Procrastination is already seen often with students who go to a regular educational institution, so online education would make matters even worse. Having potentially flexible time frames can cause students to want to postpone doing their work for another time. This can eventually add up to a student having an enormous debt of assignments, waiting to be completed. Following this procrastination, a third bad habit, laziness, develops 
4729	. I used to take online religious classes at home for an hour a day during five days of the week. Personally, I got too comfortable and lazy with my schedule and environment to the point where I eventually stopped taking these classes completely. I would sometimes be too lazy or distracted to get ready for the class. Other times, I would postpone the class to another day as a make-up day. In the end, my laziness and empty will to take these classes ended that schooling. So, developing bad habits is bound to occur when attending classes from home. 
4730	I belive that we should change the way presidents win the election. I dont think it sould be based on what the House of representatives and Senators think. It should be based on popular vote by the citizens. After all, isn't about what the people want. 
4731	Overall the Electoral College is not a good method for electing the Pesident. The Electoral College is unfair, non-useful and outdated. Its sad because everyone who votes, thinks that their one vote matters. 
4732	Each vote counts as one, and there will be more or less votes depending on the state and its size and population. 
4733	"When you vote, you vote for ""a slate of electors, who in turn elect the President"" (Source 2, Paragraph 2). Why can't it just be a regular election where you either bubble your democrat or republican representative instead of being so complicated and misleading. This can get people confused, and get them to vote for the wrong candidate without them even realizing! ""Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes."" (Source 2, Paragraph 2). In the 2000 campaign, 17 states didn't even get to see the candidates in a campaign ads; they focus on the ""bigger"" and more important swing-states to win. Each person should count as one, and each state should be as important as the other, just varying in the number of voters they had. "
4734	You're electing electors instead of just who you want for President. To top it off, you can't even control who your electors vote for! 
4735	The Popular Vote representing our country as a whole with all individual votes added up should be the deciding factor. 
4736	A tie is almost impossible in that circumstance also, because what are the chances out of millions of citizens the number would be perfectly split in half. If a president appeals for a region, then  let them vote for who they believe is the better candidate. At the end of the day, the majority wins. Swing states won't have to be a factor without the Electoral College, and big states are just counted them same, one point per vote. Run-off elections won't be necessary if the highest percentage president wins, even if its not majority. 
4737	This world is turning into a darker place. The problem is that people don't care enough. We see homeless people on the side of the street and no one stops there cars. We tend to ignore what is bad. Out of sight out of mind. I think that is ridiculous. We need to help others. If we don't then who will? 
4738	We still have poverty. If we help those around us we will make a ripple affect and can help the world. 
4739	Helping those less fortunate is a humbling experience. You learn how to be a better person and you want to try harder in life. I once worked at a soup kitchen. I saw kids just like me with parents just like mine and they were starving. I am lucky and I learned just how fortunate I was there. I know that if some of the 'bad' kids went, they would appreciate what they have and be a better student. School isn't just about math and writing its about preparing you for life. An experience like this would defiantly teach you a life lesson. 
4740	Community service helps everyone. We can make a impact in our world by starting with just you and me. We need to motivate people to help, convince them that if they don't no one will. I strongly think that all student should require to perform community service. At least an hour of our time every month. Thank you for your time. 
4741	I believe it would be a good idea to keep it, I mean why would you change something that still works?  Now unless you want to make it a better process it should stay the way it is. 
4742	Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy. ( So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actuallt gone to Kennedy.) 
4743	I think that the Electoral College is not fair to American's. We all need to be able to select as who we want as the president of the United States. 
4744	"""Do you want to be apart of a Electoral College""  Electoral colleges. Do you know what this means? An electoral college is a process of multiple facts. Not a place. As everyone thinks Electoral College sounds decieving because the word ""college"" in the name but apparentley thats not true. The founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the President and votes by the people of America. Dear Senator, this is where I begin rambling on and on about how the electoral college is wonderful and great. But I am just going to let you in to alittle bit of knowledge behind the thinking, before you get your fingers in a knot. "
4745	"Under the ""EC"" voters vote for something other than the president but for the slate of electors, who then turn over andelect who ""THEY"" want to be the president. "
4746	"Allowing the people to vote for whoever they want to is not a good idea. It can lead to bigger problems and issues. Voting for yourself can be very, very stressful. Adding on top of more strees. Of course its easier this way but your electing who is going to be the ""President"". Someone who controlls your country, tells YOU what to do, and makes new laws. It shouldn't be as easy as writting on a piece of paper who you want to be president. There should be some type of way to make it alittle more precise. This is why there is the Electoral College. All you have to do is get with someone you trust and vote for them to be apart of the canidates electors. Then all they have to do is vote for who they want to be president and see what happens. Its just as easy as what we have now but alittle bit more neat/clean. I Know I am spilling alot of information onto you about the ""EC"". And the advantages and disadvantages of having it. But I ask you to read this letter and think about what role YOU play in this election. "
4747	I think that YES our school needs to do community services 
4748	Community service helps our environment. 
4749	Also if u noticed the main word in community service is community. By doing community services you help your community by doing service, by making it better. 
4750	Community service can mean a lot of things like picking up litter, helping people, doing work, tutoring people your also suppose to do everything that would in any way help it. 
4751	By doing this action we might get sponsors or people might donate money to because we worked so hard by helping it and taking care of it the community might give back. Also I think if we do this more people will want to come to our school to enroll or interview us 
4752	As modern technology progresses, more and more of our everyday activities are shifting from manual and on-paper activities to automated online functions. A key example of this in modern society is something as normal as email. In the past, people communicated via letters which had to be mailed to each other, taking weeks to deliver;  however, the modern day email technology allows us to deliver messages to others in seconds. As we progress further and further into the future, more and more of these essential daily activities transfers from manual/ in person contact, to automated and online activities. The next major milestone of this online revolution is to make digital and online education and teaching more wide scale so that every student and school can benefit. Many schools have began to offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. 
4753	it allows students who are not comfortable or focused at school to work diligently from an undisturbed and comfortable situation from their homes 
4754	allows students to be more organized thus resulting in better quality work. 
4755	Student's will benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it allows students who are not comfortable or focused at school to work diligently from an undisturbed and comfortable situation at their homes. 
4756	A person's workplace means so much to their work efficiency and quality. Many people often find this comfortable and safe space within the constraints of their own homes. Working from home brings in a couple essential factors, that a lot of times are hard to find at schools which range from comfort, focus, and familiarity. One basic aspect that is often pointed to when talking about comfort at school versus comfort at home is the amount of noise pollution. While at school, you are often surrounded by twenty five to thirty other students who are all chatting and creating noise pollution in your work environment. However, while working at home, there is rarely any noise pollution because of the vastly lesser amount of people in your work environment. This more focused and comfortable work environment can allow students to strive and gain success rather then be out of concentration and disturbed at a school. 
4757	Many students in high school participate in a variety of after-school activities and hobbies; however, since school takes away so much of the normal student's day including commute to and from school, it is often hard to schedule and plan all these essential activities and hobbies. Personally, I partake in a major robotics and STEM club known as FTC. At FTC we retain extremely knowledgeful information about creating, programming, and experimenting robotic designs which we compete at competitions using. One of my major struggles is balancing school and FTC because I have to go to school for seven to eight hours and then find space for time to commit to FTC as well as finish my studying and homework. Allowing students like myself to attend classes from home through online or video conferences would be extremely beneficial to the way I schedule my everyday activities because digital schooling would cut out essential time-consuming factors such as commute time and block switching thus providing me with more time to dedicate to my hobbies and extra-curricular activities. 
4758	Student's will benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it allows students to be much more organized through digital tools and resources. 
4759	Attending school in person often means you will receive a tremendous amount of hard-copy and paper handouts. However, digital schooling and online schooling often uses digital copies of these handouts and online resources such as Google classroom and Google drive. The various resources allow the everyday student to be exponentially more organized as rather then creating countless physical folders and carrying around hundreds of papers, you can simply have access to everything you need from the touch of your phone screen. Digital education also allows students who have trouble asking their teachers questions in person while in front of many other students to articulate themselves personally to their teachers without being seen by their classmates through several available functions that come available with digital educating. 
4760	Online education from home and teaching through video conferences and other online tools can greatly advance teaching and education as it allows students to learn in a comfortable environment, allows students to maintain feasible and flexible schedules, and allows students to have a much more organized education. Currently, we are heading in a path were all aspects of our daily life are being digitized and improved through online functions. Our education and learning is only the next aspect to make that leap to the future! 
4761	The Electoral College basically serves as a filter for the votes of every individual American citizen. Every single vote that comes from citizens is a vote for somebody else who will be voting for the president, not the candidates themselves 
4762	The Electoral College is flawed to the point where the most logical way to vote would be to base presidental elections off of popular votes. 
4763	The Electoral College encourages the presidents who are running for office to avoid campaigning towards states with a smaller amount of electoral voters 
4764	If the president is determined by the most electoral votes, it would make sense that the president would campaign towards larger states with more electoral voters such as California, Texas, and Florida. Why would they spend time trying to appeal to some of the smaller states? This can lead to some states not even seeing the candidate. Infact, during the 2000 election, voters in the 25 largest media markets did not witness any campaign advertising 
4765	The Electoral College's process of voting suppresses the voice of every citizen. 
4766	The balance between smaller and larger states comes into play here as well. Take Florida for example, a state with 29 total electoral votes. If the mass majority of Florida votes for a certain set of electors, the minority votes for the other ones would not matter at all, as the electors speaking for that certain fraction of the population would not elected. With popular voting, each and every vote would matter towards electing a president. The number of minority votes would directly apply to the outcome of the president. 
4767	The Electoral College and the electors should not be the voice of the country. The voice of the people should be heard, especially when it comes to presidental elections. Popular voting is the most fair and rational method of voting. The Electoral College is best off forgotten as a voting system.    
4768	Would you want to keep the Electoral College or change the election by popular vote for the president of the United States? 
4769	I would want to keep the Electoral College 
4770	. I would want to keep the Electoral College because it keeps its process organized, 
4771	it helps people vote 
4772	The one word used throughout this whole article ; catastrophic, which is whats best used to describe the electoral college. The United States of America, born and based off of popular soverignty, should be just  that ; decided by the people. The electoral college has only been a hindrance since its arrival, confusing American Citizens left and right, becoming an issue to voters/interested future voters, and disallowing a fair chance of a voters vote to be of importance in their state, and to their country. 
4773	:it does  NOT  allow for a simple method of voting, 
4774	it does  NOT  allow for every vote, and voice to be heard in the United States presidency election, tarnishing this countrys' right of democracy, causing outrages all over the country.  
4775	lets begin with an important factor that the electoral college cannot be trusted on achieving, the fact that every vote counts 
4776	"With over 300 million people now in the United States, under a unified country that promotes and exemplifies democracy, we have not been democratic in the sense that peoples vote doesnt even go to their president, only to another mind that can cast you away as if you were not important. As stated in Par. 7 Source 1 an article by the Office of the Federal Register ""Most states have a winner-take-all system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate."" These are the minds that are sometimes chosen at random, or by other factors to represent you, a choice you werent allowed to make. The winner takes all method only takes away from states like Texas and California who know their vote doesnt matter because these people will always agree on democratic or republican, and what is currently used in our society. This damages thousands of voices, thousands of votes that could have matter, but seemingly don't. Just like  how schools have implemented the 'No Child Left Behind' policy, we should transcribe this to leaving no american citizen without a voice, only dependant on what state their in. "
4777	"Theories on how a single vote doesn't matter have been given, as stated in Par. 23 Source 3 by Richard A. posner ""Voters in the presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election."", "
4778	one thing is known as a world wide factor that applies to almost everything that we do. Simpler, is better. 
4779	If you take your precious time and read all Par. 1-8 in Source 1, what you will gather, is that an extremely over-afflictionated method is used when determining our next president.  Step by step instructions on selecting, choosing, voting, controling, and nevermind the problems it has already caused from the confusion of all these instructions. Something that can be fixed easily by one thing: overriding, fixing, and changing our way to popular vote. This would furthermore simplify our country way of voting, attracting more voters, and overall satisfying many people.  
4780	Some have also stated that this is necessary to providing a more organized form of voting 
4781	Key knowledge that must be analyzed is that: just because a service is organized, does NOT mean its correct. 
4782	"Referencing to Par. 11 Source 2 Bradford Plumer describes on how ""The American People should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election in a century; the system allows for much worse."" and ""that those elctors could always defy the will of the people."" in Par. 9 ""according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al-Gore-Thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency."" Many problems that would not ocurr if our way of voting were to be simplified into popular vote. "
4783	To summarize, and simplify (what should be done with our voting ways) this letter to you, we should remove the electoral college overall and implement the popular voting, to which our country is based off of. This is the most profound way of fixing the problems that we face: the unsimplicity known as our current voting ways, and the restablishment of our original, and hopefully still true government of Democracy, and Popular Soveriegnty.    
4784	I belive the electoral college should be abolished as a process over all. 
4785	because it does not benefit the U.S. in anyway 
4786	as caused multiple problems in elections over the past years. 
4787	The electoral college should be abloshied because it has caused multiple problems over the past years during elections and could continue to cause problems. 
4788	"The electoral college process consists of selecting electors, as you know, but those electors do not always vote for their partie's candidates like they should. This process causes the popular vote to not always guarantee pesidency to a certain candidate even if they have the popular vote. In 2000 Al Gore had won the popular vote but lost presidency because of the electoral college. Not only did one inncident occur but multiple occur because of the electoral college. As stated in paragraph 11 of Bradford Plumer's article, in 1960 segregationists in Louisiana's legislature almost succeeded in replacing Democratic electors with new electors who opposed John F. Kennedy so if Kennedy got the popular vote he wouldnt have got the presidency. Like Bradford Plumer clearly stated ""the electoral college is unfair outdated and irrational."" The electoral college should be abolished so that problems can be eliminated and elections are fair. "
4789	The electoral college should not only be abolished, or destroyed, because it causes problems but also because it does not benefit the United States in any way. 
4790	The outdated, unfair system just hurts the U.S. government and the country as a whole, it does not benefit our government or citizens in anyway what so ever. Under the electoral college system voters are voting for a slate of electors who don't always vote for their own party candidate rather than voting for the candidate they want to govern our country. 60% of voters would prefer direct election and popular vote anyway so why not throw out the old worn down process that dosent work and replace it with something the people of this country actually want, popular vote. 
4791	Some people might say we should keep the electoral college because each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee so nothing can happen 
4792	but according to history things can happen such as in the 2000 election. Why keep a process that the majority of the citizens of this country don't want and a process that just causes issues.  
4793	The electoral college is a thing of the past, a has been that almost no one wants around. Popular vote elections would be more fair and will not have mistakes during elections like the huge mistakes the electoral college system has proven to display. The citizens of America want the electoral college gone and popular vote elections should be what the government is aiming for so we do not have mistakes in our elections and so the U.S. can benefit from actually having a working election process.                    
4794	To start off, the electoral college is a system thats been around for ever but is getting outdated. I think that some people might want a different system while others prefer the same or dont care. For all we know,Bob Dole could be right about abolishing the electoral college. Or maybe it needs a new way of carrying the votes. 
4795	While the idea of driverless cars appeals to many, is it really practical for modern day America? Sergey Brin has proposed and imagined this utopian idea. 
4796	The creation of these seeming easy cars would actually make everyones life harder, not only on the roads, but in the court rooms as well 
4797	These cars would obviously be extremly costly to make, and would put stress on all tax payers if roads were to be remodeled. 
4798	The idea of driverless cars is impractical and shouldn't be taken seriously. 
4799	"There is a quote that states, ""Be careful what you wish for becuase you just might get it."" What this quote boils down to is that as much as one might want something that aesthetically pleases them, it may turn around to be a truly awful mistake. Driverless cars cause more trouble then they are worth. "
4800	A prime example would be, if a driverless car were to be made, having to switch the roads and the designs of them. Tax payers already pay for the seemingly never ending road repair, let along new roads for cars that arent even a necessity. Many engineers at Berkeley attempted to use magnets in driverless cars that could read in binary code. They discovered there needed to be grotesque and expensive changes to pre existing roads, making the whole ordeal impractical. After realizing that roads were too hard to deal with, money wise, Google tried to make cars that were smarter. With all of the upgrades required to make a smarter car, the cost of the driverless car wouldn't be fathomable. How are people supposed to drive cars when they cost too much to own and take care of? 
4801	If a car could go forward on its own, but can't drive under certain conditions, how is it really a driverless car? If a person in the car were to fall asleep while being drove by the car, then there were to be an accident that the car couldn't handle, how would the car alert the person it was time to drive. There is a big reason as to why people dont hop out of bed and into a car. The brain needs time to adjust and wake up before attempting a process that can quite legitimately kill people. A single car accident can kill many people. Pretending that driverless cars are a toy isn't an option. People with health problems wouldn't find a driverless cars helpful either. Awareness of people who cant feel vibrations, cannot hear, and cannot see, would all be in danger riding in this type of car. Without being in control of the wheel and acceleration at all times reduces the feeling of needing to be alert in the car, causing more careless accidents that could have been avoided if the car had an alert and ready driver. 
4802	With the idea of driverless cars, sprialing and time consuming court cases come along. When accidents happen, usually the two drivers are taken to court, with the exception of car recall cases. When two driverless get in an accident it leaves the question as to why two, in fact driverless cars, would hit each other. This also brings up the question as to if they are even driverless cars. A driverless car would technically have to be driverless and not need a human assistant to run properly. Thus saying, more car companys are more likely to get sued in the court of law for murder, vehicular manslaughter, and many other charges most car companies don't get hit with using regular cars. 
4803	"Another pretty famous quote states, ""If it's not broke, don't fix it."" Today's cars are fully functional and drive almost perfectly on the roads we have now. To switch the great thing that is going on now would be useless. In this economy, America does not have money to throw around. To mass produce driverless cars is and forever will be unconventionally excessive. In order to save time, to save money, and save citizens from dreaded jury duties, driverless cars should remain in the movies. "
4804	they would make the world a more productive place 
4805	the cars are still in development 
4806	they would be cheaper in the long run. 
4807	First, I will talk about how they would make the world a more productive place 
4808	Next, I will talk about how they are still in development. 
4809	I think that a lot of people are judging driverless cars by the way they are working now. We shouldn't give up on them so soon; Scientific discoveries happen all the time. Someone will find something that completely changes driverless cars for the better. Besides, they already show so much promise. In test drives, these cars could survive more than half a million miles without a crash. Mercedes Benz, Audi, and Nissan plan to have driverless cars by 2020. Let's wait until then to judge driverless cars. 
4810	Lastly, I will talk about how they are cheaper. 
4811	The driverless cars that Google cofounder Sergey Brin foresees would use half the fuel we use today. Fossil fuels are becoming an issue, but what if we had one less use for them? Without the need for so much fuel that wouldn't be so much of an issue anymore, and we would have more time to plan for whenever the time may be that we run out of fossil fuels. Also, if we perfected the driverless car there will be a lot less crashes. Without so many crashes we wouldn't be paying for repairs as often. We also wouldn't pay for the medical bills and such associated with an automobile accident. 
4812	life in my eyes has to have a little responsibility and in what better way than to help other people in community service. 
4813	So my conclusion to you would be that children should be requested to do community service but not so many hours were it takes the away the fun in life. 
4814	it takes up our time to do things that we need to do 
4815	It will take our time when we have a lot of homework to do and we don't get it done. It will also take our time because when we want to go shopping or need to go do something it will take our time. If you want us to tutor elementary school children we would have time taken away from learning at school. We have almost the same school hours like them. So we would take our school time away. If we want to we could ask you more about it. I know that helping the community is good and very important but not to spend all your time on it. 
4816	I would do community service but not all my time because i want to spend time with my family, get my homework done, and learn more at my school. I want to do fun thing but yet I want to help my community to be a better place. So i kind of go with helping and having our own time. Not all the time i want to do community service and only where we can get all what we have to do and then go to do community service. 
4817	Also, If you were to change to the popular vote, it would be fair. 
4818	Everyone would get to put in their opinion on who should be the president of the United States. I think that if everyone was to be able to individually vote for their president, there would be less chaos and arguements about the election and also the new president. But, it is possible that the winner of the electoral vote won't win the national popular vote. But, it is very rare. Some people don't bother voting because of the fact that their vote will have no effect. They have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote. 
4819	"In the 1960's driverless cars seemed more as like a futuristic fantasy rather than reality, but in todays world, they just might be the next big thing. In the late 1950's, General Motors created a concept car that could run on a special test track (Ph. 3). Although this was the first concept of a ""smart car"", the roads would need an unrealistic upgrade that would cost extremely to much. Today however, we have the technology to make real driverless cars. The toll of human error has been evident in the auto-age as more accidents happen every year. "
4820	The use of driverless cars, or at least almost driverless cars, will be benificial to the future as less accidents will happen, preventing more casualties.  
4821	Today, many cars all across America and the world have road assistance and antilock breaks, but this still gives drivers the oppurtunity to make a mistake and cause an accident. 
4822	Technology today makes creations and inventions capable of almost anything. 
4823	"We have had extreneous experience with sensors and radar, two things that are almost required for a driverless car in the upcoming future, to make one. In the 1980's, more than 30 years ago, automakers used speed sensors at the wheels in the creation of antilock brakes (Ph. 5). With all of the experience gained, we now can make real driverless cars. Infact, we all ready have. Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009 (Ph. 2). Their cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash, but roadblocks and problems do lie ahead for a true ""driverless car"". "
4824	As driverless cars are a relatively new idea, restrictions will be diminished in due time. 
4825	The discussion of whether or not the human in the seat or the car manufacturer will no doubt be on the minds of lawmakers, but they would quicky come to the conclusion that it would be the driver's fault, since the driver bought the car and knew what he/she was getting into. Manufacturers would also make a liability agreement required in order to driver the car. 
4826	"Teen drivers today are distracted when they first begin to drive. With a driverless car, however, teens could possibly get distracted but would not cause an accident. The car could continue driving for them. If the cars could accelerate for the driver, they could also prevent the driver from speeding. This would prevent many young adults who are less experienced on the roads from being pulled over by a police officer and given a ticket. Many parents may also become distracted while driving with young children. Young children need attention from their parents, and while in a car children tend to distract their parents more often usual. When a parent looks away from the road and to the backseat where their child is sitting, even if they are only looking away for a few seconds, they could run into the oncoming lane of traffic or possibly a ditch. With driverless cars, these accidents could be prevented. As long as the parent or teenager has his or her hands on the steering wheel, the car will drive itself. With BMW's ""Traffic Jam Assistant"", the driver would be able to look away from the road and the car would still be able to steer, accelerate, and brake themselves. Incase of a work zone or accident, the driver would be notified and they would assert their attention back to the road. This ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" would be useful while a mother needed to tend to her child in the back seat or while a teenager talked on the phone to their friend. "
4827	"What is the point of people voting if they are not really getting a say in who they are really voting for? The Electoral College has a bigger say then the thousands of of people who vote. How can a group of peoples say mean more then thousands of people in the United States. Also, the ""Winner-Take-All"" sytem does not help anymore then the Electoral college does. What is so special about the Electoral College that they get picked specially to make their vote count on who wins or loses the election? "
4828	"These People were Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO. Turned out their not the only ones according to the exerpt from ""The Indefensible Electoral College: why even the best-laid defenses are wrong."" is sates ""They're not alone; according to a Gallup poll in 2000 taken shortly after Al Gore- thanks the quirks of the electoral college- won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of the voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" "
4829	Cell phones are huge distractions in school. They lead to high school drop outs because of their grades and, not to mention, they lead to low income. If we let students use cell phones more in school they may get the thought they can do whatever they want. We need to put a stop to this now so our future generations will be able to support their families. 
4830	Students should not be required to do community service because it's unfair for the students who don't want to clean or pick up trash 
4831	know that community service is a good thing to do but we also need to look out for ourselves. We have schoolwork that needs to be completed, extracurricular activities to do, and chores back home that need to be completed, we just wouldn't have enough time! 
4832	Our schoolwork is a major priority to us children. 
4833	We need to complete it so that we can understand things so we can grow up to get a good college, and have a good future. Our parents and even you put enough stress on us about these things so why would you go ahead and give us more things to do when we already have a lot of stress on our backs. We have about 7 class a day all which assign at least 30 to 45 minutes of hard core studying and working. Multiply that by 7 and you get about 4 to 5 hours of homework per night. sure that's not every night but when it is its hard. This leads me in another reason why this extra chore is unnecessary. 
4834	Sports! Clubs! we have these thing too you know. and after our 8 hours of school add this on and it almost makes it 12 hours. plus our homework, do you really think that we would have enough tine to waltz out into the wilderness and pick up trash every day for another 2?!!?! 
4835	When someone joins a sports team they make a commitment to do their best and try hard. How hard do you think we could try when we are tired from working every day?? This inst a jail, we have enough stuff to do that can fill up our day. And quiet frankly i don't think that any one would even participate in this even if it was required, it is just to much of a burden on us students. 
4836	We also have to go home and do some choirs, foils some laundry, take a shower, and eat. That to takes up another hour, lets add it up 8 hours at school 2 hours at sports 2 at community service (which is what you want)  +  1 at home...  _____________  That's already 13 hours of the day, and who knows, maybe someone had more things to do, like sports out of school, or scouts, or dance. The possibility are endless and adding this could makes someone day could make it torturous. This also leaves us no down time to read, relax, or watch T.V. 
4837	When there is snow in the forecast, students and teachers alike eagerly await a call from Generic_Name, the beloved public information officer for Generic_City Public Schools. Cheers are heard across the county when his voice is heard on the phone announcing that school will be closed due to the weather. Both students and teachers embrace the well-needed break, using the time off to catch up on grading, get some much needed sleep, relax, pursue hobbies, or hang out with friends. Continuing the learning process on these days off would lead to stress for unprepared teachers and sleep-deprived students. However, when snow days and other such holidays start to build up, classes may fall behind in the curriculum. This would lead to teachers rushing to cover all the material before the AP test or state-mandated final exam, and students struggling to understand the new material so quickly 
4838	When this happens, distance learning could be utilized to continue covering the curriculum in a timely fashion. While distance learning has its benefits, it should only be used in extreme circumstances 
4839	because it does not offer the same environment for learning as a traditional classroom, 
4840	First off, distance learning cannot offer the same level of personalized learning and support that a teacher in a traditional classroom environment can. 
4841	A teacher who knows their students can better tailor the lessons to them based on their learning styles and needs. For example, a teacher could dedicate more time in class to review logarithmic functions with games or act out  Romeo and Juliet to help the students better understand the concepts. Activities such as these that are beneficial to students are not possible through distance learning, and could harm a student's level of understanding about a topic. Additionally, it is harder for students to get help when they do not understand new material or need clarification through distance learning. Traditionally, students can ask their teachers questions, visit their teachers during their office hours or study hall, or meet with a peer tutor. For distance learning, a student would have to video call or email their teacher, but it is much harder to explain or understand concepts without being able to meet in person. 
4842	If both are possible options, a traditional classroom offers better education and support for the students; however, in cases where it is not possible to access a school for an extended period of time due to dangerous road conditions or the threat of a novel virus, for example, distance learning is a good alternative to stay on track and finish teaching everything in the curriculum and therefore be prepared for exams. 
4843	Secondly, distance learning cannot foster student-teacher relationships or student-student relationships like a traditional school can. 
4844	When students see their teachers everyday or every other day, not only do they learn about the subject matter, but also about each other as people. When students have a good relationship with a teacher, they seek advice from their teachers, ask for teacher recommendations, and talk about their successes and shortcomings both within the subject area and outside of school. The impact of this type of relationship can often be felt long after graduation. In addition, it is also much easier for a student to discuss with or ask questions to someone they feel comfortable around. A teacher that is unknown or only seen through a video conference feels foreign and awkward, making communication and understanding difficult. Then there are relationships between students: close friend groups, couples, study groups, and lab partners, all important parts of high school. Students build relationships that foster discussion and learning, as well as support each other emotionally. Musical ensembles, honor societies, volunteer organizations, sports teams, and student government, among other extracurriculars, would not be possible without physically meeting. Activities like these build close connections by bringing together people who share similar interests and impart specific knowledge outside of the core classes. Overall, collaboration between students teaches vital communication, teamwork, and leadership skills that are necessary regardless of profession and can only be gained through shared experience. 
4845	Finally, distance learning does not have the tools that schools do to help students struggling with their mental health. 
4846	In schools, there are counselors, coaches, teachers, and friends who can identify if a student is not doing well and get them the help they need. Without interacting in person, it is hard to tell if a student is struggling and in need of help. This type of attention could be the difference between life or death in extreme cases, and should not be overlooked. In fact, more and more schools are placing a greater emphasis on mental illness and stress. Schools often encourage students to engage in de-stressing activities such as yoga, meditation, or sports. Because the focus of distance learning is purely learning, there is no emphasis on the well-being of students, a practice that could lead to detri mental consequences for students in the long-run. 
4847	With the advent of new technologies, learning from the comfort of one's own home has become more popular. However, it cannot offer as much as a traditional school in terms of education, relationships, and mental health. More importantly, distance learning would rob students (and teachers) of the sheer joy of a snow day and the healing properties that come with one. Therefore, distance learning should be viewed as a last resort for when instruction is too far behind due to having to miss school for a long period of time.  
4848	I believe this way because I think that the people should have the right to choose who represent their country, not the House of Representatives/Senate. 
4849	"The Electoral College in most cases is unfair to most voters because of the whole ""winner-take-all policy"". "
4850	Some states have less electoral votes given to them and that may seem unfair to some. 
4851	"Candidates dont't spend time in states they know will have no chance of winning. they only focus on the tight races in ""swing states"" that are most likely to pay closes attention to the campaign. "
4852	The Electoral College is hurting our county because we are not getting the accurate votes we think we're getting. Citizens are not going to want to vote anymore because of how unfair these campaigns are. Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think a single vote may decide an election. 
4853	"In recent weeks, news of new, life threatening viruses (such as the Corona virus) has gone up at a rapid rate, causing a large amount of disarray and discomfort within the educational system; between the staff members, the students, and the parents, it seems inevitable that schools will close to keep the students and the staff members as safe as possible. Once they understood the circumstances, parents and students started to have questions; ""how will the students continue getting their education?"", ""what format will it be in?"", and ""how will it be administered?"" The response that most school counties developed for these questions was long distance learning. Distance learning is a new format of teaching where students stay at their homes while completing assignments; but, this method of learning has gotten somewhat controversial. Many teachers argue that distance learning is not effective and that it allows for students to copy, cheat, or flat out be lazy. This is a true judgment, but misled; "
4854	when distance learning is applied to hard working students, it allows for significantly better results more consecutively, making it way more effective than the current system set in place. The reason for its better performance is because of two aspects: 
4855	number one, it allows for students to learn and practice taking initiative, 
4856	number two, its allows for students to learn to identify what their individual work process is, learn to adapt to it, and apply it to the real world. 
4857	"The controversial part about distance learning is one of its fundamental aspects; the distance. The system of learning that was in actions for decades was based on a word to mouth learning process, where you had to be instructed in multiple different classrooms, on multiple different subjects, by multiple different instructors; it's quite tiresome, I must admit, but the degree of work is not the issue. The issue lies within the ""spoon fed"" mentality that develops in a work space such as this; a work space entirely devoid of any personal initiative. Never mind don't, when adolescents can't take the initiative for things that deeply benefits them, they will inevitably feel as if they are just a hamster running on a wheel, or just another gear in a clock, causing for a lot of procrastination or laziness; the stripping of self initiative develops a feeling of diminished importance in ones self leading to less attentiveness and over all less care for the subjects being learned. Quite frankly, the students that perform the best in school are the ones that are taught from an extracurricular source, whether its from their parents or someone else, about the importance of education, allowing that child to decide for themselves that they want to pursue it wholesomely i e. they took initiative to learn. "
4858	With distance learning, students can be in the comfort of their own homes and decide for themselves when they feel best to engage in a new topic. 
4859	Regardless of what educational system is in place, whether traditional learning or distance learning, there will be the students that wont study, will copy their friend's homework, and will cheat on test, its unavoidable; 
4860	this is still true for distance learning, and with common sense, the side effects of it can be determined quite easily. 
4861	"When given the option to to stay at home to complete school, in opposition to going to school to complete school, nine out of ten students would agree in an instant to stay home. When further asking them their reasoning, the responses your most likely to receive consists of this : ""Im going to go out and chill with my friends"", ""Im going to sleep in everyday"", ""im going to go out shopping"", or flat out ""Im not going to do any work."" The distance aspect of distance learning, when in the hands of people who initially didn't chose to go to school, will be full of procrastination and laziness. There can be measures applied to attempt to weed out the students that are straggling and try to help them develop better work habits, such as retake policies and extra help, but if a student doesn't care for what he or she is being told to work on, inevitably they will figure out a way around that work. "
4862	Work is of key importance to success; with out working, you can't attain a great majority of success. Evidently though, work comes in many different forms and styles, usually deriving from how that person had grown up and been raised; so, a work process that may come as natural to one person, may be foreign to another. 
4863	Learning what a person's work process consists of is fundamental to attaining consecutively good results; distance learning allows for students to be able to distinctly figure out what schedules and work patterns works for them. 
4864	While still in the traditional educational system, the process of work during that educational period is at the will of the instructor, if the instructor isnt going at a speed you can comfortably retain knowledge, then a lot of information that is being taught will not be remembered; when this process is repeated, it can lead to a development of stress or a numerous slew of issues.  
4865	In conclusion, if distance learning were to be put into action nationwide, the outcome would be very beneficial. Students that take initiative for themselves will become more prosperous and successful then the ones that don't; even then, the students that don't take the initiative are given the opportunity to learn how to and apply it to their lives. With the ability to stay at home, students can get the time to learn their work habits, adapt, and improve upon them so they can preform to the best of their ability, regardless of what they are tasked with. And yes, Although there are students who are not compelled to complete school, the amount will be greatly reduced because of the encouraging nature of distance learning, which allows for students to take their own initiative in learning something beneficial to them.  
4866	Started with the founding fathers. The Electoral College was founded and swung into the constitution, as a compromise between Congress and the President with a popular and electoral vote. Now that time has evolved and the world has changed. The Electoral College is not in the favor of everyones expectations, it seems like it favors one side more than it favors others. 
4867	Intially, the Electoral College should be changed to election by popular vote, because it is an unfair way of choosing presidents 
4868	"Electoral College has been around for centuries, but now people feel as if the way presidents are being chose to run our country is unfair. The Electoral College is an unfair way of choosing presidents, by it being known as a winner-take-all system. Stated in the passage, ""Candidates don't spend time in the states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the swing states."" The candidates in the ""lame"" states did not even see a single campaign ad. The swing states have a higher chance and more likely to see their campaign ads, because they are the more popular states. The more popular states are ""the most thoughtful votes, and should be the ones to decided the election."" Swing states get campaign ads, they are the ones who are being favored, while there are other states just trying to get a campaign sign, and get their votes recognized. "
4869	I think every student should be prerequisite to do at least two hours of community services. 
4870	Community services is a commendable thing to do because we all are helping out the community by helping little kids such as tutoring or cleaning up your neighborhood for a cleaner earth.  
4871	Some people might just think community service takes too much time away from what they have to do and is a waste of time 
4872	But by doing community services each of us is doing something subsidiary. I think if we all do this we can make our community a better place to live in and i assure your that after doing so many good and helpful things toward others, in the end you will feel and be a better person. 
4873	Community services is also good because it is sometimes prerequisite for some high schools and colleges, which will make you look like a better person, being part of the community. 
4874	Some types of community services; is volunteering at the hospital helping clean up litter by the road sides or side walk. Even helping out at your church or just going to the nursing home to help. All this and much more will help you serve in the community and be a better person. 
4875	There is litter everywhere in this town and we need people to pick the litter up. 
4876	For example, litter can become a health problem or can affect the environment. if there is too much litter it could be disaster. the environment can be affected the most from litter it can kill plants which mean no oxygen and can kill animals which means no food. people health can also be in jeopardy. if there is too much litter the air can become polluted and people would become ill.  Another example is, nobody would want to live in a polluted place with litter everywhere.  its disgusting and dirty. people can die from litter and there health can be destroyed. Community service is not a waste of time because your helping the environment and hundreds of people life.  
4877	The electoral college denys that right and that is why the state senator should change that. 
4878	Not only do the popular votes barley make a difference but, with the electoral college in play the representatives vote for our president, not us. 
4879	If popular vote was the way the president was elected the elections would be fair. 
4880	To start with, how can we live in a democracy were the people do not pick their own president but, some representatives we suposadly chose can. If we were alowed to choose our own president then we could at least feel right in what we chose and not what the representatives did. 
4881	Also, acorrding to the Office of the Federal Register a total of 270 or more electoral votes are needed to elect a president. The total amount of votes consists of 538 electors, meaning there could be a tie in elections. This implys that the system is not fool proof and can have errors. However, if the popular votes were counted more than the electoral votes there would not be any chance of a tie and a president will always be elected. 
4882	Most Americans do not know that they are voting for representatives who in turn vote for the president making this unfair. Thats just another reason why the electoral college is outdated and not needed. 
4883	Although the popular vote system is a little bias and favors the president the citizens like the most, 
4884	it can also prove more effected for the fact that there will always be a winner no matter what. The popular votes system cant be represented by most states like the electoral college does but, it does have the vote of the entire country as opposed to a few states with more representatives. 
4885	In conclusion, the senator should change the voting system for many reasons. First, the popular vote is more reliable and there will always be a winner. Second, the electoral college has an even number of votes meaning there could be a tie therefore ruining the election. Finally, most people would like to personaly vote for theyre president rather than someone else to do it for you. These simple reason suggest why the senate should change the system.           
4886	I myself do not think that students should be forced to do community service because community service is something that people should want to do. 
4887	That way kids would feel like their making a change and getting rewarded that's a great feeling. Some kids think community service is dumb and gross because you have to pickup trash. But if kids get rewarded they will strive to help in their community and stop trash build up on the freeways and out in front of their own houses little thing will start to build up and make kids want to do big things like go to other countries in need of help and help out with them like in Haiti were there is still a lot of rubbish all around. Kids and adults can help out every where there is need of help from the state of Ohio to all across America and then the whole world!  
4888	I think our school should keep performing community an service, because it's a fun and good task, and most kids at different schools don't get the opportunity to experience community and service day. 
4889	I think the the Electoral College is a very irrational way to elect our presidents of the untied states of America. It might have been effective when it was first created, but now it dosent seem like it can work out anymore. 
4890	"""Do voters sometimes get cofused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes."" This is why the Electoral College needs to be abolished. "
4891	In the course of human existance, humanity has always been striving for progress, you might say going the extra mile, in order to better our society. One such great invention was the automobile which allowed us to travel great distances in a short period of time. Consequently, the natural instinct, to grow and improve, has been transfered to the idea of the automobile through the self driving car 
4892	Self driving cars are the future of transportation as the offer a host of positive benefits 
4893	precise driving capabilities, 
4894	increasing affordability, 
4895	new safety technology. 
4896	"The self driving car has begun implementing technology that can revolutionize a car's self awarness. For example the article states, ""spinning sensor on the roof. Dubbed LIDAR, it uses laser beams to form a constantly updating 3D model of the car's surroundings."" Unlike the human eye, the LIDAR radar sees anything and everything; not only does it never miss a single detail, but it also has a 360 degree view that current drivers simply do not possess. These sensors are expecially useful when backing up and driving backwards, as many drivers struggle with getting a full view of what goes on behind them. However, with the LIDAR radar, this problem is eliminated, making backwards driving easier. Putting radar into the drivers seat is not so much about losing the human touch of driving, but getting a more accurate perspective on the road. "
4897	Secondly, the technology is finally in a place where self driving cars are becoming a feasible economic option. 
4898	"Sebastian Thrun, founder of the self driving Google car, said, ""There was no way, before 2000, to make something interesting. The sensors weren't there...Radar was a device on a hilltop that cost two hundred million dollars."" In fact, alot of the technologies, including radar, used in self driving cars have been around for a long time. However, in recent years, they have become alot cheaper and precise, so that the dream of creating a self driving car is a reality. The goal of the self driving car was never to create a billion dollar high tech vehicle accessible only to the rich, but one that could be mass produced and avaliable to all. With cheaper, mass produced technology, it seems like this is not too far up the road. "
4899	"With so many deaths accounted to texting and driving, the idea is that people would be able to safely text when the car drives itself certainly has its appeal. However, when the car needs a human touch, ""displays [texting] can be turned off instantly when the driver needs to take over-something not avalible to drivers trying to text with a cell phone."" Shutting off the display would force drivers to pay attention to the road during tricky situations and reduce the number of car crashes. Secondly, the use of sensors helps detect and prevent crashes. The article says, ""sensors have become more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out of control skids or rollovers. This information from the sensor can cause the car to apply breaks on individual wheels,"" which could stop potential dangers in their tracks that the driver may not be aware of. In the end, a self autonomus car is always vigilant and is never distracted, making it safer than having a human driver. "
4900	Self autonomous cars are more accuate, becoming cheaper, and are safer than today's cars, making them the car of the future. It is only a matter of time before someone develops a self driving car that can be mass produced, and when that day comes, we should embrace it with pride. Together, let's drive towards creating the car of tommorow, today.                                                                                                                                         
4901	"In the past years our country has been run by a ""electoral college"" voting system. Has always been the soultion to our (america's) equation. Its been in bussines since 2012 now and so far has seen no problems. Our country has a strong base an voting system for our country period . "
4902	"Even though"" elctoral college may some times be unfair out dated , and irrational.""(from ""source 2: the indefensible elctoral college: why even the best -laid defenses of the system are wrong""). "
4903	The way we are voting now has no problems so far 
4904	Recently I have begun to research the difference in effect on the people of Ameirca, between the Electoral College and the result of popular cote for President. I have found out that our founding fathers created the Electoral College in the Constitution, so that while the votes between Congress and the people may be different, ther could be a compromise. Our country; well our world, is evolving with the changes in generation. 2015 has come upon us, and with this year brings a whole new change in cutural diversity and tehcnology. So while I believe sticking to our coutry's Constitution is vital for some reasons, I also believe it is outdated in others. 
4905	There are many reasons why the voting process should be changed to popular vote instead of the Electoral College. 
4906	the Electoral College is often considered an anachonism and is unliked across the nation. The reasons for which vary greatly from certainty of outcome to big states to swing states. 
4907	Certainty of outcome means that one of the Presidential Candidates has to be cosen to become President. There are no recounts in Electoral College, whoever they like the most becomes President, and that ins't fair to the people. Bigger states tend to have more members in the electoral college. This can greatly influence an election if a big state like Texas favors one candidate over the other. Swing states are the states that recieve more atention than other states due to bias, greatly influencing votes. In my opinion, this is something that needs to be changed.  
4908	Citizens of the United States of America are the ones who are supposed to decide who should be the President of the United States of America. 
4909	It isn't right to select a few people from each state to decide who the President will be. That power lies with the people, and nobody should be able to take that away. The votes of millions and millions of people are out-weighed by the votes of a few hundred men and women. This is unjust and unfair in every way. If all the people in the United States wanted somebody as President, but the Electoral College disagreed, the Electoral College would win. Why should the Electoral College have more power than all of the people of the United States; they shouldn't. The power to decide who is President of the United States of America should always lie with the good citizens that live here.  
4910	I hope that the voting process will change. I hope that it will finally become fair. That it will become what the people want it to be. It should be what the people want it to be. We the people of the United States have the power to change this, and we should work to change it. The voting process should no longer be the Electoral College but should be dicided by the people and only the people. The voting process needs to be fair and needs to be what the people want it to be.    
4911	I beleive that you should consider voting against the electoral college. Now you may ask why, but, I assure you that the electoral college is a way for corrupt presidential candidates to win the office and make this great nation a horrible place. 
4912	Segregationists replacing voters of one canidate for another 
4913	the election could become a catastrophe if a tie were to happen 
4914	"there is a chance of a ""disaster factor"" happening. "
4915	In 1960 segregationists in Louisiana nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose J.F.K. 
4916	Source 2, Bradford Plumer, The indefensible electoral college: why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong, P. 11, line 44) Imagine if the corrupters had been able to corrupt the election, we might have had a fiasco bigger than the 2000 presidential fiasco. If we were to continue to turn our backs on the matter we would soon be run by fatasses who spent all their time gaming and would claim they know exactly how the sytem works, opposed to a real man who spent all his time rising from the bottom up and knows the system by heart. Who do you think would win if those 2 people were to run for President? Not the one who should. 
4917	but, in 1968 a shift of just 41,971 votes would have deadlocked the election, if that doesn't seem so bad lets take a look  at how many people are in the United States alone. In 1976 a tie would have occured if a mere 5,559 voters from Ohio and 3,687 from Hawaii had voted the other way. (Plumer, P. 12, line 80) 
4918	"like the one in the 2000 Al Gore VS. Bush Presidential election. Imagine if that were to happen again, only, this time, we put a blood thirsty, war hungry, nuclear savage into office. Imagine the Iraq and Afghanistan wars from 2000-present and then imagine them being fought on our own soil, imagine, instead of little Iragi children fighting against an invading force, your children fighting against an invading force, and that is just one of the minor things that could happen. Imagine if we put a man in office who thought the way to answer everything was through nuclear war, imagine what would happen to the United States. These are just a few examples of what could happen if another ""disaster factor"" were to happen again. "
4919	There is a lot contraversy regarding the Electoral College system of voting in the United States. Some voting members would argue that the system, although flawed, has yet to make a monumental mistake, and say that the minor issues were resolved or at the very least barely effective in the overall outcome of the capmaign. However, with the flaws and holes in the system we have alerady experienced, there is bound to be many more mistakes, and it would be shocking to very few that some of those mistakes are catastrophic 
4920	We should remove the system of the Electoral College because it is questionable, problematic, and does not represent well our democracy. 
4921	The Elecoral College uses a group of people from each state, numbers varying from each, to represent voters in an election. The voters mark down a candidate on a ballot. However, they are actually voting for a group of strangers to represent them. Many voters do not even realize that this is the case. In politics, there are many powerful and influential people who will go to drastic measures to ensure that their ideas somehow make it to power. Bribes and insentives could easily be given to electors in attempts to sway their vote. Speaking of, these electors can be anyone who are not in a public office position, emphasis on the anyone. Voters can never really be sure that they can trust those strangers who they did not even get to select. Once the votes have been counted, voters cannot fully control who the elctors actually vote for. There have been instances where electors have attempted to completely avert the votes cast and choose a different candidate that they want in office. 
4922	It only seems logical that voters should have a direct say in the presidential election by participating in an election by popular vote. This way, there is less opportunity for scandal and confusion in the voting process. 
4923	In 1960, a group of segretationists in the Louisiana legislature almost succeeded in removing electors who supported John F. Kennedy with those who opposed him. If this had happened, all of the states electoral votes would have been cast by biased electors, rather than by the actual voters themselves. In the same year, Hawaii sent two state electors to congress instead of one. It is sad that we maintain a system in our government that continues to let issues like this arise. Along with issues with the electors, why is it that the size of a state automatically gives it a bigger advantage in elections? Texas and California are the most two saught-after swing states in every election. Candidates will do everything they can to win over those electoral votes. But what about the little states? Many of the smaller states do not get visited by candidates. Some never even see campaign ads. This system we are using creates target areas in the United States that are more valuable in elections than others. This is in no way fair to the voters in smaller states, despite having the exact same rights as voters of bigger states. 
4924	The Electoral College is proving to be less and less glamorous with every passing election. Slip ups like this can create a monumentally bad situation, and unfortunately, this system is only bound to create more. 
4925	Many people remember the problem of the 2000 presidential election. The Electoral College had very effectively exemplified its flaws and unefficient ways of opperating. Al Gore and George Bush were running apposed, and despite winning the overall popular vote in the country, Gore lost the election to Bush. Bush had received the most electoral votes, therefore winning him the presidency. Basically, despite the fact that more citizens chose Gore to be president, Bush won out. In our constitution it is written that citizens of the United States have an unwavering right to vote and select who gets put into office. In this case, it sounds more like the number of electoral votes has an unwavering right to select who gets put into office. 
4926	This goes against a democratic republic way of opperating our country and, in many ways, makes it more difficult for cititzens to take advantage of their rights. 
4927	For as many frustratingly resolvable problems that are created by the Electoral College, there are certain things about the Electoral College that could possibly make it worth keeping. 
4928	For instance, there technically is no region of the country that has enough electoral votes to vote a president into office, so no one area of the controls large numbers of votes. Along with this, the system helps avoid Run-Off Elections (which complicate the election process and provide a clear winner). 
4929	However, having a straightforward election where the votes come straight from citizens is most constitutional and much less problematic. The process has been used for a long time in our country, but it is time to make a change.  
4930	The Electoral College has proven to be more trouble than it's worth. Our country needs to decide what is within best interest for representation of our citizens, the most efficient way to opperate one of our most sacred constitutional rights, and maintain our democracy as members of our wonderful country. Remove the Electoral College system.       
4931	Some people are just to busy to devote their time to community service because they could be taking care of their children, or doing sport activities, they could be doing college work or even homework. 
4932	The United States is a democratic country where the people decide on a leader through voting, or so it's supposed to be. We Americans use something called the Electoral College, where a state is worth a certain amount of points, and when you win that state for your party, you gain those points. I find this to be unfair, because you could win by popular vote, but lose because the opposing party won the states with the biggest number of points. 
4933	I think that the Electoral College should be removed and replaced with popular vote only. It would make elections more fair, and it would make peoples' votes feel like they change something. 
4934	When you go to vote, you don't actually vote for the candidate, you vote for a group of people who in turn vote for the candidate. I find this to be ineffective, because the people you are voting for are still able to switch there vote to the other party, 
4935	humans aren't the most honest things on Earth. Also, there is the feeling of being important that you get when you think that you could tip the scale, it makes you feel special, and in control of your own country. What's the point of voting if there's a chance it might not matter, because the other party just won California, the state with the most amount of points, 55, and you couldn't do anything because you live in Idaho or North Dakota, with only three little points. Popular vote would make you feel involved, and happy to help. 
4936	"But big states, like California, Texas, and Florida have some of the most points, so if you were to win those, you already have more than one hundred points. Candidates would try to just seek out those jumbo prizes and systematicaly try to win the largest behind ""the Big Four"". If someone was reading this and wanted the Electoral College, they could say that the big states would still have an advantage with more voters, and that is right, but they wouldn't be as big of prizes. So the election turns from a voice of the people, speaking up for a new leader, and turns into a mad chase to get the biggest prizes before the other party, like a game of Monopoly. In Monopoly, you buy areas with your money, and when someone lands on that space you own, they have to pay you. The places ath the end of the board have the priciest cost, but the best outcome. You can also build property on spaces to make the enemy players pay more. If you were to buy those, you practically win the game. On the other hand, the spaces at the begining are basiclly worthless, costing about 100 dollars and giving you about 1000. Those are like the small states, that have almost no value to the election, and the big states are worth a lot. "
4937	Cell phones are going to take learning away from students if they have there phones with them all the time. 
4938	To keep kids focus they shouldn't bring there phones to school or if they do bring there phones to school then give it to the office or your teacher to hold on to it until school its over. 
4939	I feel that if you let the students bring there cell phones to school it could start something or bring trouble. 
4940	students would not benefit more as opposed to learning from an actual classroom setting in a school building, especially when thinking about the resources and skills that schools can teach and offer.  
4941	One of the many reasons why schools exist is to provide a social setting that students are able to immerse themselves in. Schools provide a setting in which students are able to able to socialize with other students, creating a group or community for themselves as they form friends with the students they attend these classes with. 
4942	This is not provided online; take home-schoolers, for example. Many home-schoolers report feeling socially isolated from people of their age group as a result of not having the social setting to thrive and form friendships in. These home-schoolers are not given the opportunity to create bonds with students because their classes are primarily online; it is because of their isolation that many home-schoolers find difficultly forming friendships with others. Online schooling and video conferencing takes away that social aspect of school, and can thus result in students who are unable to socialize with other people when it comes to the real world. 
4943	However, there are people with certain anxiety disorders who would appreciate being able to learn from the comfort of their own home. 
4944	But, immersing them in an environment that encourages social interaction would be a more ideal situation as they would be able to learn how to overcome their anxiety; there are more effective, and less drastic measures that can be taken to help a student with social anxiety as opposed to taking them out of the classroom setting altogether and replacing them with online settings.  
4945	Not only do schools and classroom settings provide the ability for one to form relationships and learn how to interact with other students and adults, they also instill the necessary cooperative skills that students need in the real world once they have completed their school career and move onto the next step of their adulthood. 
4946	For example, schools have their students build collaboration skills through group projects; online schooling or video conferencing does not provide this same benefit of collaboration. When a student is working from the comfort of their own home, they are not actively collaborating with other students; it is essential for students to have the ability to cooperate with other people in the real world. These group projects add the benefit of teaching students how to work with others in order to get certain tasks done, preparing them for when they have to inevitably work with other people they may not necessarily like. Online schooling is largely independent, and requires the student to rely on themselves and only themselves, while classroom settings teach both independence and dependence. Students must learn how to work with other people so that they can learn how to deal with individuals who are difficult to cooperate with, and so that they learn to rely on others when in need of assistance. 
4947	Not only do online classrooms lack certain aspects necessary for a student to survival in the real world, but they also lack the accessibility of help when a student needs it. 
4948	In a classroom setting, students are able to ask for help from their peers and teachers so that they can better understand the topic they are learning about. Online settings do not have this help accessible to their students all the time. Video conferencing may provide that needed assistance should a student need it, but students may feel uncomfortable asking for help as video conferences are typically done in masses; students who are all taking the course from home would be on the video call, and asking questions would require teachers to stop their lesson to re-explain a concept to everyone because one individual asked for help. In addition, video conferencing settings lacks the ability for that students to bond with the teacher, unlike classroom settings, which can increase their feelings of discomfort towards asking for help. An example of this lack of accessible help can be seen through loudoun vision, an online system which allows students to take their classes from home and online. Many students who take courses through vision feel an overwhelming anxiety about taking the class because they do not have a teacher accessible to them; they are expected to complete overwhelming amounts of work without the help of a physical teacher nearby. As a result, many students procrastinate doing the work, and are thus left with more anxiety about the class in general. Students who take vision courses complain about their teachers, who have a tendency to fail them as a result of doing an assignment wrong because they did not understand it. It is because of these scenarios that physical classroom setting are more beneficial than online or video conferences, as they have the necessary resources for students to be able to ask for help. 
4949	When comparing distance learning and in-class learning, it is evident that students would benefit much more from being in a classroom setting than from learning in the comfort of their own homes. Not only do online classes and video conferences lack the ability for students to gain any sort of social skills, but they also lack the ability to teach students how to cooperate with one another, which is an important skill that students must acquire to survive the real world. In addition, in-class learning allows for students to ask for help when needed. It is because of this that students would not benefit from attending classes at home. 
4950	Congress should change the election by popular vote for the president of the Unites States. 
4951	Lastly, it provides an accurate result of who should be president. 
4952	In summation, instead of having an Electoral College, it should an election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. Popular votes helps the government understand their citizens better. It lets them know what people want from the government, allows them to have the freedom to make a choice of the president, and gives the government a picture of how many people liked a candidate's plan for them. All in all, popular votes would make elections for the president a lot better to understand.                     
4953	To sustain a C average without playing sports is one thing. But if someone sustains a C average while playing one or more sports is actually quite an undertaking. 
4954	I believe that other rules having to do with the sports themselves should be altered before there is a change in the grade requirements. 
4955	If you are going to change something about the sports program change how long the practice can be or the amount of practices allowed per week. 
4956	That in itself will give the student athletes more breathing room so they will have an easier time bringer their grades up. If these work than you can keep the required average at a C, but if these fail, that is when you would be obliged to make the required average a B so the students have more drive to keep their grades up. But at the time I think you should change the limitations of the sports programs in itself before any of the grade requirements are changed. 
4957	Driverless cars are the new future to this planet and in technology. There needs to be a new and improved way to drive cars, even if the driver does not need to touch the steering wheel. 
4958	The cars that he foresees would use half the fueld of today's taxis and offer far more flexibility than a bus. 
4959	sensors and displays in the car that allow you to focus on the task at hand when you are driving. 
4960	"Dr. Werner Huber, a BMW project manager driver said, ""We have to interpret the driving fun in a new way."" In the car that he is overseeing, it uses heads-up displays and information systems that will notify you of an accident ahead or a roadblock that calls for a detour. The displays can be automatically turned off which is something not available to drivers who are texting and driving. Another detail would be that of manufacturers consideration of using cameras to watch the driver to make sure that the driver is paying attention if he or she needs to take control of the car. If the driver is paying attention to the road, then he will not need to be notified and or have the company of that car be notified. It allows the driver to pay closer attention to the road and not his surroundings. "
4961	Safety is a number one priority in cars and in life as a whole. If your car is safer to drive on the highway, it will reduce the cause of accidents and save you and others around you money. 
4962	That is why manufacturers are considering using displays that will automatically turn themselves off so that the driver does not get distracted behind the wheel and cause a serious accident. GM has developed driver's seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object, which would then notify the driver that they are too close to an object and that they should stop immediately and look at their surroundings. All of the little gadgets that are put into this car as well as other cars, are allowing the driver to pay better attention to the road and the objects around him. Cars are getting smarter by the year which is reducing the number of accidents per day. Which is why driverless cars are a must for safety. 
4963	The reasons stated above show how and why that driverless cars are a must for everyday life as we know it. They save you money by not having to pay so much for gas everytime you have to fill up. The car is being driver by the hardware that is inside of it and it will notifiy if you need to take over and steer. The last reason is safety. If the car is not safe, it should not be on the road. Driverless cars are allowing the driver to pay closer attention to the road as well as what is happening around him better than if he had all the lights in his face and his phone placed in the cup holder or in his lap. The driverless car is being developing to become something greater and more useful for everyday human life. This shows how and why driverless cars are a must for everyday life and why I agree with the developement and manufacturing of these cars. 
4964	"""I can drive with no hands!"" I can just imagine my baby brother saying that in a couple decades. The future is just a little bit ahead, and driverless cars are going to be the biggest thing since the wheel and just a flash. "
4965	Driverless cars would be a postive, efficent, and a improvment in the world, 
4966	there would be less accidents, 
4967	a smoother and quicker navagating system, 
4968	could make America on top because of our technoglicial advances: such as a driverless car. 
4969	In my opinion, Im in favor of changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. 
4970	"""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight racs in the ""swing"" states."" "
4971	So basically the electoral college doesn't give a fair chance to voters and that's not right. All voters in every state should get a fair chance. 
4972	"""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality. And the arguments against direct elections are spurious at best. It's hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college!"" "
4973	"""The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be [overruled] by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense . . . it is the electors who elect the president, not the people."" "
4974	Which once again is not fair and isn't right. If people are taking the time to vote then they're the ones who should be picking who the president is. Not the electors. 
4975	"""When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors."" "
4976	"""The single best arguement against the electoral college is what we migh call the disaster factor. "
4977	Everybody needs to know that our world needs to get better and cleaner. Littering is probably the worst thing out there that you can do. Something needs to change because when you just walk outside of your house there's a piece of trash and you can help by just picking that piece up. If you could get all the students doing community service then those students could inspire other students or even their brothers, sisters or even their own parents. If just one person could help pick up a little trash then imagine what ten or even fifty people could do this world would be better in no time if everybody could just pitch in a little of there time everyday by making the world a little better. 
4978	The Electoral College was created with good intentions, but it has many vital flaws which allow for very unfair outcomes. The electoral college is an outdated, and irrational way to choose the president of our country for the next four years 
4979	You can completely ignore some of your voters, as you're guaranteed to either win or lose heavily biased states, and you can gain massive numbers of electoral votes due to one more vote for a side in a state count 
4980	The electoral college's biggest flaw may perhaps be its ability to elect a president that doesn't even appeal to half of the country 
4981	Republicans have a strongly biased voter base in the south - so much so that generally speaking, the Republicans never have a single rally or major ad. According source two, states like South Carolina almost never vote Democrat. It's so rare, that if you lost, you offended the group that has voted unquestioningly for your party since the system has been put into place. If the electoral college system didn't exist, the thirty percent of southern Democrats would have a say, which would make advertising and campaigning all over the country much more vital. 
4982	People are being entirely ignored by the powerful politicians that are supposed to represent them. That doesn't sound very democratic and fair to me. People begin to feel discouraged and that their vote doesn't count, and this is quite close to the being the case. Only one-half of elligable citizens voted in the 2012 election, which means that one half didn't. Half of our country isn't bothering to vote in the elections because the electoral college system completely negates their vote. 
4983	"Our country prides itself on being ""the land of the free, and the home of the brave,"" yet our people are being discouraged at every turn by our government. The popular opinion of our people is that the government is out to get us, and there's not much evidence to contradict that. The electoral college system allows for the government to be run by men who didn't fairly win over our country, and isn't accurately representing our views. It's rife with corruption, and allows money to buy power. If we remove this system in favor of a popular vote election would encourage more popular policy, make our government closer to the people, and have little to no negative impact on our country.    "
4984	Students all across the nation are doing community service to help out their town or city. Whether it is cleaning the streets, helping out in an old peoples home, or tutoring children at a school, all these deeds are good experience and good for the community. 
4985	this is because after hours of dedication to helping out, children will see what good they are doing for their friends, family, and other acquaintances in the town. Also, there is a high chance that kids that are not heading the right path, will steer into the lane of success. By doing this, they see how they make other happy around them and will start feeling better about themselves and have a much greater respect around elders. To end off on this knowledge I would like to add that children that to participate in this will have a wider and more open mind. They will be open to new ideas and will learn something along the way 
4986	Another reason why this community service is necessary is because this provides less work for older, more delicate people, and more work faster and harder workers such as students that are in high school and college 
4987	While doing this less older people will be injured in activities such as cleaning the streets, their homes, and helping them with buying supplies needed for their health. This will cause a chain effect on them making them pay less for medical bills and more on other things such a necessities and other good that will help them through everyday life. 
4988	By cleaning streets and parks, children will have a safer environment to live in and will grow up living in a much nicer area. It is a non-arguable fact that if a child is born and raised in a safer community, free from dangerous litter, they will grow up to be much healthier. From poisonous gasses and rodent killers, to little things like sharp glass and aluminum cans everything will be cleaned up. This prevents choking hazards and toxic fumes to be entered into a child's system. 
4989	community service is needed for three clear reasons: it helps children learn and experience the outside world, it helps the old people community, and makes it a safer living area for little children and adolescents. So please Mr. Principal, make community service mandatory, for the greater good of our living area. 
4990	"And, I also know why they are some reasons why they wouldn't want this method to be here. In source 2 it stated ""voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of the electors"". Everything depends on the state because it decides most of the voting standards of the whole state. "
4991	We should make a change in our goverment and make elections by popular vote 
4992	If we are going to have Electoral College lets at least know who our elector votes for. 
4993	First of all we don't know who picks the electors. We don't know if there truthful as in putting in votes. I'm sure they have to have certain requirments to become an elector but we are not the ones chosing them. In the 2000 campaign 17 states didn't even see the people running in the election. Also in an Electoral College ties exist so then it has to be thrown into the House of Represenatives where the delagations will vote on the president. Making our votes worthless because the people in the goverment get to chose whos next to become president.  
4994	"If you were to question U.S. citizens about what an electoral college is, what would they say? Most of them don't even know its a process established in the Constitution in which electors ""vote for president and vice president,"" and then are counted by the Congress (Source 1, paragraph 1). They don't realize that their votes can be over-riden by these votes "
4995	And those, if the very few, who do get it, are opposed. They would prefer another system, a more modernized system, and are disgruntle about how unfair the system is, not only about how the electors are chosen but how the larger states have an advantage in votes and in information 
4996	"Most voters are opposed to such systems, according to Source Two, ""... over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now,"" (paragraph 9). Yet we still have the Electoral Colleges going. "
4997	We need a system us as people can control ourselves 
4998	"As in Source Two, I will ask you the question, ""Who picks the electors in the first place?"" Certainly not the citizens as a whole, most of the time its picked by the state governement in some shape or form, but sometimes, even the presidental candidates themselves can pick them (paaragraph 10)! As well as in Source Three, where its clearly pointed out that ""... it is the electors who elect the president, not the people,"" (paragraph 15). It's outragous how easily they can pull the wool over our eyes, and even worse how we let them. But no more. "
4999	"As you probably already know, each state's ""...entitled allotment of electors equals the number of memebers in its Congressional delegation..."" (Source One, paragraph 3). Most represntatives spend most of their time campaining in places like New York and California that the small states such as Rhode Island arent even visited. ""In the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see candidates at all..."" and that campaign was refered to as a ""fiasco"" in which the Electoral College caused a dispute (Selection 2, paragraph 13).  "
5000	This leaves the smaller states less informed and more likely to vote to the exact opposite of what they want, and yet they still have as much say in the vote 
5001	"In Selection Three, it is said that the swing states (or larger ones) ""... are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average (and for the further reason that they will have received the most information and attention from the candidates),"" (paragraph 20).  Selection Two points out something very important that should be stressed, ""... each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 5000,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 represantatives from California, who represnt 35 million votes,"" (paragraph 12). This shows the citizens aren't really being represented properly. "
5002	"Altough many downfalls, ""The Electorial College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states... lose"" and ""avoids the problem of elections in which no one recieves a majority of the votes cast,""(Source Three, paragragh 21 and 22). "
5003	If I had a say into which should be used and which should not be used, I would rule in the favor of the popular vote process and not in the favor of the Electoral College process. 
5004	The first reason as to why I would be in favor of the popular vote process is that in the Electoral College process, big states are being more effective than small states. 
5005	"This might lead the small states to not vote because they feeel that they would not make a difference. Source #3 claim the following, "" So, other things being equal, a large state gets more attention from presidential candidates in a campaign than a small state does...."" When bigger states have more electoral votes, the candidates will be lead to thinking that if they get the bigger states, for example California who gets 55 electoral votes, to be in their favor then they might have a bigger chance at winning which will have the small states, like Hawaii who only gets 3 electoral votes, thinking that they have no say as to who gets to be their president. This claim is supported by source #3 when it is stated, ""  Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote"". "
5006	"The second reason as to why I am not in the favor of the Electoral College process is because as said in source #3, "" Voter is toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign- to really listen to the competing candidates- knowing that they are going to decide the election"" "
5007	Candidates mostly pay attention to states that have more electoral votes, this causes them to pay more attention to the bigger states and leave out the smaller ones, as already argued, some states get more electoral votes than others. Another reason why this is bad is because most states will not pay attention in the election because they will not make a difference. If popular vote were to be in action, then more people and citizens will pay attention because it will be a more interesting election since more epeople have a say and the candidates will pay attention to all states. Even the bigger states with more electoral votes know that they are the ones to basically decide the election. 
5008	The popular vote process is more effective and fair for the United States in choosing the President. Most people can argue in that favor as well. If you qwant the elections to be fair, I supposwe that you will pay attention to the voice of thousands of citizens and you will be fair.                         
5009	When electing the president of the United States, you must vote in favor of the president you want. However, instead of coming down to popular vote, the system uses the Electrolar College to decide. The Electroral Vote works in that the people of a certain states votes for their candidate and the majority of people who vote for a certain president give their votes to a slate of voters. What this means is that the popular vote within a state wins the electoral votes of the electors who then vote for the president. 
5010	Many people dislike this system including myself. 
5011	I disaprove of this system because it limits representation 
5012	permits the disintrest of voters 
5013	reduces a candidates intrest in a state. 
5014	One major problem with the Electoral College voting system is that it limits representation of the people. 
5015	The Electoral COllege votes work so that the population of a state directly effects the amount of votes that states recieves. For example, Wyoming only has about 500,000 voters so it only recieves one electoral college vote. Because there is only one vote for wyoming, the 500,000 voters do not have acurate representation in a vote that has a total of 270 electoral votes. 
5016	There have also been times in which a president has won the piopular vote but lost the Electoral College vote. This was seen in the 2000 vote of Bush versus Gore when Gore won the popular vote and Bush won the electoral vote. 
5017	One might claim that because the amount of electoral votes for a state is based of the population, it is fair. 
5018	However, I believe that the popular vote is more fair because it expresses the opinion of the majority. 
5019	In some states, there is a large majority of people running for a single party. This can be observed primarily in Texas where an overwhelming majority of voters are Republican. Therefore, the Republican president wins Texas almost every election period. This can be frustrating for Democrats who live in Texas because they know that 
5020	their vote does not matter causing them to lose interest in voting in the first place. This is not fair for those people nor is it particularly good to express as an American trait. 
5021	"As stated before, the larger the population of a states, the more Electoral College votes that state gets. This leads to a small group of ""big states"" that have such a large amount of votes, they are the target for candidates to try to persuade to vote for them. On the opposite side of the spectrum, most of the other 50 states have a smaller amount of votes and are less of an objective for candidates to acquire. "
5022	In many states throughout an election preiod (the period in which candidates move to diferent states giving speeches) the candidates never make an appearance in their state at all. 
5023	This is observed in the 2000 election in which seventeen states did not have the candidate make an appearance at all. This also can lower interest in voting for the president. 
5024	The Electoral college voting system is not fair in the way the present system works. The system does not show proper representation of the people, does not promote interest in voting, and causes a candidate to ignore the states in which do not have a large amount of electoral votes. 
5025	Times are changing. Driverless car technology is being created, with slow and steady progress. The technology for these type of cars has only been developed over the last few years because of a lack of technology. There are several companies trying to develop these cars, but they're pretty much at the same step. Knowing how driverless technology works, who is liable for damages, and how it will effect drivers is crucial to the possible future use of driverless cars.  
5026	Driverless technology has to be understood by the consumer. If the consumer does not know how this technology works, it could cause some serious damage.  
5027	Liability for the accidents caused by driverless cars has to be settled. 
5028	"The companies that make the driverless cars, or the driver, it is yet to be determined who would be at fault. The company for making flawed technology, or the driver for being in the car. ""Still, even if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident. If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturere?"" (Driverless Cars Are Coming paragraph 9). This will be a huge issue if driverless cars do become legal. Driverless cars could effect the people in more way than one. "
5029	"Also, who would want a driverless car if you still had to driver it? That does defeat the purpose of the name of the car. ""Wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive?"" (Driverless Cars Are Coming paragraph 8). Being occupied while sitting there is imperative. People will become bored if they have to just sit in the seat all day long. Companies have to come of with entertainment systems, but an issue with that is losing attention. While being in the driver's seat of a driverless car, being attentive is imperative. There may be situations where the car cannot handle it, and it requires human skills. ""This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires."" (Driverless Cars Are Coming paragraph 7). There is a double whammy right there. Companies have to balance out occupying the driver and keeping them attentive; but there is no way to be distracted and attentive at the same time. "
5030	The technology that is being developed might have a future, but in the near future, there is no way it'll work. Right now, they aren't even driverless cars, the cars still require a driver. Surely there will be progress on that aspec of the cars. Just simple knowing how the cars work is the first obsticle. Also, being able to figure out who is liable for damages between the manufacturer, or the driver of the car is a huge issue that comes with this. Lastly, how it will effect future driver's skills, and attentiveness while driving. Will there be a future in this industry, or not? Only time will tell.          
5031	School is a requirement for all children and young adults in the country, so distance learning would be beneficial to any students who are unable to attend. 
5032	Reasons for this include mental and physical disabilities that may inhibit a child from experiencing a normal and comforting education 
5033	allows those who are sick or unable to attend certain days the opportunity to not fall behind, 
5034	would make attending class easier by not requiring students to wake up as early as they do and prepare for school. 
5035	As all humans and creatures on earth do, people will inevitably get sick. Because of this, students could miss crucial education and fall behind, creating a lull in their schedule as well as lowering their grades 
5036	. By creating a system where students are able to work from home, unforeseen events such as an illness or injury will not be as great of a setback as before. 
5037	From personal experience, only missing two days made a scenario where I had missed multiple tests, a plethora of notes and information, and in class assignments that I would end up turning in late, all while trying to complete the current work as well. While it does seem like a benefit to just skip the day to get better, walking to a computer and working from home does not require much work at all and would serve to be much more beneficial than missing a day of school. 
5038	Online learning can be either part time or full time, and thus if a full time online attendance is set in place, it would make attending class that much easier. 
5039	By attending class online, students do not have to deal with the daily chores of waking up early, preparing for school, and in many cases rushing to leave in order to not be late. Being tardy for a class can be severely punished even if it was not directly the students fault, which could lower productivity and motivation. It is widely known that students complain about this dilemma already, and with online learning, it can be solved in a simple and cost effective way. 
5040	Mental and physical disabilities are far spread greatly varied, and create situations where it is harder to preform physical tasks, learn, or even communicate with others in society. 
5041	This causes a problem where it becomes difficult to attend school effectively, either due to the stress or confusion created by other students, or the literal inability to preform satisfactory and participate in certain activities. Certain students with autism, asbergers syndrome, etc, may find it extremely stressful to forcefully attend an environment where they are exposed to peer pressure, bullying, and sometimes harassment. Individuals with certain physical limitations such as being crippled or wheelchair bound may find it hard if not impossible to engage in activities such as sports, or even any activity that requires a major amount of movement. As somebody who has a family member with autism, I see the effects of going through this environment, and hear the many complaints and ways it upsets him every day. 
5042	Through online learning, these students can be given the opportunity to flourish in society through a comfortable environment. 
5043	The previously stated reasons reflect upon the need for online and distance learning to be more widely spread in this country. In doing so, many new opportunities will be created while making solutions to many challenges in every day life. All aspects and corners of life will be able to cope with school and their own education plans to make a future that benefits them and the rest of the world. Stress would most likely be lower than its current average in the student age group, and national grade averages would see a rise. This change could make the United States a more economically successful country due to higher education rates and success in schools, and make it look better as a whole.     
5044	Community service is something people do voluntary, not something that should be required. 
5045	Students have other things to worry about such as studying, 
5046	homework, 
5047	chores 
5048	Already there is many students who don't study at all, and making all students do community service would discourage the small percentage who do. Doing things like cleaning and taking care of younger kids can be tiring. Even adults get tired of doing these things, imagine how a minor would feel. When a student is tired and has the choice to study or not they would most likely rather not; well after so much work they have just done. Not studying can lower test scores, and not to mention lower student grades. 
5049	There's another reason why it could affect the use of homework. When you have such a tight schedule (which can be harder to those who play sports or clubs) your only option is to do your homework at night. Which is really bad because students end up having less hours of sleep, which is required for a good healthy day. Homework should be done right after school, but with this new task it wouldn't be possible. 
5050	Parents as we all know are very strict about chores, and when a kid doesn't accomplish them, parents can get really mad. 
5051	Of course you can prevent that by actually doing them in first place; 
5052	"but what if you have to community service first? Your parents might understand the situation you in, so they'll probably post pone ""clean up"" day to the week end. Which is the only days a student has to forget about their troubles at school. "
5053	There's another reason, socially this would ruin social activity after school; 
5054	In conclusion, i believe the idea of making students do community service is absurd and completely irrational. Students have social lives they need to fulfill. 
5055	Our tax money is going to the cause anyway so why bother. People get payed for this stuff so it shouldn't be a privilege. 
5056	There are schools that offer distance learning for students so that they can work in their homes on computers. Online learning can be beneficial to the student for health reasons or personal reasons; however, sometimes distance learning is not as beneficial as the classroom experience. There are many aspects of a physical classroom that online students will miss out on. Online classes can be simple for the student, but the simplicity of online learning is not enough for the education of the student 
5057	Online learning can be beneficial to the student when it comes to students' individual schedules. 
5058	There are students have jobs, have lots of homework, and have emergencies, so online classrooms can benefit these students because online learning can allow the student to work on their own pace. For example, if a student has a death in the family, the student should take time off from school to mourn and attend services. If that student missed classroom taught classes, the learning experience the student missed cannot be brought back since the entire class as whole moves on through a designated schedule, and the student would have much work to catch up on in little time. But, if the student was taking online classes and missed multiple classes, the student would only worry little in comparison to a classroom student. Since online classes allow students to work on their own time, the student with the family emergency can always catch up whenever he is done with his personal business and he does not have to worry about other classmates' progress in the class. That way, online learning can be beneficial to the student. 
5059	However, the social experience between a student and his peers in the classroom can help the student grow as an individual with good social skills. 
5060	In the classroom, there must be some communication between the students. For instance, communication among the students is present when the teacher assigns group work. In group projects, such as PowerPoint presentations, Google Slides presentations, dioramas, posters, and videos, students need to work together to complete the assignment. Through this experience, students can create good communication skills with each other and make friends comfortably. This characteristic of the physical classroom cannot be found in a digital classroom. In a digital classroom, students do not see other peers in person, making communication harder. Also, students do not know what is happening behind the screen with other students. Students may mistakenly distort communication with each other, eventually ruining peer relationships. Learning social skills from the classroom will help students' social skills in the outside world, so it is important that students take the physical route to classroom learning rather than online learning. 
5061	Student communication with the teacher becomes easier when the student is in a classroom rather than in an online class. 
5062	In a physical classroom, the teacher is usually present and is easily accessible, but in an online class, the teacher is not always there when a student needs them; the student would have to rely on sending an email or sending a message through a school-sponsored online chat and wait for a response. The waiting time can range from seconds to hours, or perhaps, days, depending on the teacher's schedule. For example, in the summer, a student may take an online class for economics and personal finance. There would be a time where the student would need to ask a proctor a question about the testing rules, so in that situation, he would email and wait for a response before the test date. However, the student received an email regarding testing rules after the test date. In situations like this, there is uncertainty in determining when the proctor will respond since the student does not know exactly when the proctor is online; but, in a classroom, this scenario would not happen. Because the student is face to face with the teacher, he gets an immediate response. This makes the situation much easier and stress free for the student.  
5063	Physical experience can help students learn better in a class than on a computer. 
5064	Online, the student is limited to a screen with lesson materials on it. Also, schools and teachers are limited to adding documents, websites, and tests online. Because of these limits, the online experience feels dull and straightforward with tests and documents. In a physical classroom, there are lectures, models, posters, and hands-on activities available to the student. These physical resources can help a student remember class materials better through the unique experience they would go through. Unlike the online learning experience, a physical learning experience is flexible and fun to the student. A computer will fail to produce these resources to the students because of its limited functionality from technology. 
5065	 Classroom taught classes are more beneficial to students rather than online classes because of the social skills students attain, the simple communication the students have with teachers, and the memorable physical experience the students gain. These significant differences in physcial classrooms and online classrooms should be taken into consideration by many schools when deciding whether or not they should offer online classes. Technology should not be overused by schools in the age of modern technology; otherwise, modern students will lose the social skills and educational benefits a classroom would have brought. Classroom-based classes will benefit the future of students. 
5066	We, as voters, have a right to be able to vote for whomever we choose; not someone to choose for us. We should change the Electoral College to election by popular vote 
5067	We, as the people of the United States of America, have always had the right to freedom (freedom of speech, religion, ect.)- so why don't we have the freedom to directly choose our president? 
5068	In conclusion, we, as the people of the United States of America, need to inderstand that the road we are headed down with the Electoral College, is not a good road. We need to stand up and allow everyone to be able to have a say in elections. With the popular vote every citizen will have they're own say in what gets made of our beautiful country. We, the people, need to make the change from Electoral College voting to popular vote becauseit gives people a say in who runs our country, an eaier way to elect someone into office, and no one state has more of a say than another. 
5069	Every 4 years, many people vote for a president they think will lead the United States to greatness; some, however, don't know that they are voting for the Electoral College to vote on their choise. This act of using the Electoral College is, by definition, not democratic. Didn't our founding fathers create this country promising democracy and people representation? They did, and that is why the Electoral College must crumble. 
5070	we need to change how our country votes on its leader; we need to use popular vote for the president of the United States 
5071	his method is more democratic 
5072	the people representing the  Electoral College are flawed humans 
5073	the nature of this type of election forces some states to be ignored 
5074	According to Source 2, the voters--the ones supposedly voting for our new president--vote for a group of electors instead. Due to the power of the Electoral Colleg, electors can vote for any candidate. This process we have every 4 years is truly un-democratic. For example, during the 2000 election, Al Gore was the candidate with the most popular votes--this meant that the majority of the citizens of the U.S. wants him to be president. However, Al Gore lost since the majority of electors from the Electoral College voted him. Lastly, in the case of a time, the lection will truly be un-democratic; the House of Representatives will have to choose the new president. 
5075	The people may allow continued usage of the imperfect Electoral College, but there is still one major problem: the Electoral College is made up of flawed, easily manipulated humans. 
5076	According to Source 1, the electors are made up of people chosen by the candidate's political party. Immediately, these electors can easily decide on the candidate to vote on; it's just the matter of the amount of electors each candidate has. 
5077	Also, the electors are human beings, and everyone knows that humans are flawed creatures. According to Source 2, electors have been replaced to be against the opposing candidate or wait until the last minute to vote. Although, according to Source 3, the electors are chosen and are given trust, others can still influence them. Candidates or even political parties can influence the electors to vote for their chosen person. 
5078	During the 2000 election, 17 states weren't even able to see a candidate they are voting for the title of president. 
5079	"Although it is understandable that candidates go to the ""swing"" and populous states, there is no excuse for ignoring thousands of people from the small states. "
5080	The president of the United States is the president for an entire country, not just a region of it. Voters from the non-swing states will still want to see the candidate to decide on who to vote for, even though they aren't voting for the actual candidate. 
5081	In conclusion, the Electoral College and its electors must be disbanded so that popular vote will be used in determining the new president of the United States. According to both Source 2 and 3, the process of voting a group of people to vote for you is un-democratic. Electors, the people making up th Electoral College, can be manipulated and coerced into voting a specific candidate. Lastly, non-swing states will be ignored; this will anger and frustrate them since not one candidate tried to persuade them. Florida State Senator, you must, in the best of your ability and then some, try to topple down the un-democratic roots of the Electoral College. The people, the ones who must truly decide on the president, will be immensely greatful towards you; in a 2000 poll, 60% of the voters even stated that they want a popular-vote type of election. 
5082	Cameras, drivers seats that vibrate when a vehicle is in danger, and flashing lights on windshields see all components that are possible to add to the already sustainable Smart Cars to make them more interesting, effective, and productive. 
5083	Ever thought of a car that drives itself? Seems pretty crazy right? Its been shown in movies and televison and it seems pretty impossible. In reality, people are actually trying to make it happen, there has been proto types of cars that are mostly driveless and testing of many kinds. Whether it happens or not, theres a weighing question of is it a good idea? 
5084	it cost a lot, 
5085	may not even ever work, 
5086	its dangerous.  
5087	Money is a huge factor to this type of technology, can you imagine the cost of developing thousands and millions of cars that have such an advanced technology to be able to drive, brake, get to a destination all by itself? 
5088	"Its pretty expensive to even to make a proto type or test run these so called ""Diverless Cars"". If a car like such is created how would the world be changed? Not only would the car itself be expensive to create but theres more factors to just creating the cars, its how the cars themslef work. In the article, ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" the author tells about some proto types or car similar to the ""Driverless car"" image. The authors gives an example about cars that uses sensors or radio signals that are telling the cars what to do. That means, the roads would have to give off certain signals that contribute to the car itself, the roads and lights would also have to have signals and sensors. It would cost tons of money to do things such as rebulid roads or lights so cars like these would properly worl. "
5089	The car that drives themself may never actually be a thing, there is so much to it. 
5090	The cars may never truly be driveless, technology cannot do everything humans do. There is always going to be times an actual driver may need to come in. Things such as, traffic or crashes or roadwork and there is no way of telling if driverless cars may be able to adapt to that. Not only is adapting a problem but is our technology advanced enough to have driverless cars? We as a society are advanced in the technology area but is it advanced enough to develop cars that are able to know where to go or what to do just like humans are? Technology things do not think like humans, they don't think at all, they have to be programed a certain way and there is always surprises or certain situations that these cars would not be able to do it properly or safely. 
5091	Safety. This is quite the biggest concern with a product such as a driverless car. How can you insure that these cars are 100% safe? 
5092	The cars technology may run into a problem later on that it, itself is not advanced enough to know exactly what to do so it may cause a person danger. The whole car is made of technology and we can not rely on it, things happens, technology may not always work. There has to be certain signals or things such as a battery life, or the technology may just fail altogether. If someone was to be in a driveless car and the system in the car or the technology were to crash was stops the car from doing the same? If the technology messes up and the car doesn't know when to stop it could cause a crash. Technology can never be completely relied on, until it can, there will always be safety issues or concerns and thats enough not to make something that could be very dangerous to someones life. 
5093	"Additionally, Richard A. Posner says that ""There are five reasons for retaining the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree; all are pratical reasons, not liberal or conservative reasons. He then goes on and says, ""A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible...but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote."" In the Electoral College system, their will always be a certainty of outcome. "
5094	Mars has been a planet that we have been exploring for many years. We have discovered many abnormal objects on the planet. In 1976, we took a picture of the region Cydonia, and we found something that seemed to look like a human face. Our eyes are adapted to recognizing faces and that is why we recognized the face on Mars more easily. Higher quality images that were taken in 2001 show that the face on Mars is no sign of ancient civilization on Mars but in fact a mesa. 
5095	It is a natural landform just like it would be on our home planet of Earth. Although some conspiracy theorists say differently, and think that is some sort of ancient civilization building these objects.  
5096	First off, the cameras that we have today are more advanced than the ones we had. 
5097	"The first picture that was taken of the face on Mars was taken in 1976 and the quality back then was not as good as it is now. The picture that was taken in 2001 was a higher quality picture and scientists figured out that is was just a mesa and not a sign of any ancient civilization on Mars. For example the camera used in 1976, spanned 43 meters compared to the camera NASA used in 2001 spanned 1.56 meters. In the picture of 1976, the shadows that were present that day formed an illusion that made it seem like there was a face. In paragraph two of the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"" it says that, ""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh."" "
5098	Another thing is that, Jim Garvin, a cheif scientist from NASA's Mars Exploration Program, compared the Martian mesa to natural landforms that occur here on Earth. 
5099	"In paragraph 12, Garvin said, "" It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about thye sane height as the Face on Mars."" Jim Garvin is saying that these formations on Mars are very similar to the ones that we have here on Earth. He is also saying that there os no face on Mars. "
5100	In contrast, conspiracy theorists say that there is a face on Mars and that there is ancient civilization on Mars. 
5101	The face has been a pop icon ever since the discovery of the formation. the face will always be a piece of history and will always been known to man. If there was an actual face on Mars then that would be a sign of life. The face ended up eing a mesa and nothing else besides that. Although it would have been an exciting discovery for NASA, we still have much more of space that is unknown and unexplored. NASA is bound to find some kind of incredible object. We will have to wait until that day comes and find something incredible and will be part of the incredible true story of space.             
5102	The electoral college needs to be abolished for the sake of our citizens. We would all benefit from changing the voting system to Popular Vote, on voting for the president of the United States 
5103	"In source #2,  The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong, by Bradford Plumer , says, "" Prehaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. In that case, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. "" Who wants that? What's it even worth voting then if your vote, your vote on the leader of America gets put into the hands of the House Of Representatives to decide on. Think about it. "
5104	Students attend school everyday with hundreds of other students around them. The amount of small interactions one student could have with another are countless. Large public gatherings are a recipe for the spread of diseases. There has recently been a rise of concern about the infamous Coronavirus. A solution to prevent the spread of the virus includes, but is not limited to, students attending online school to lower the chances of it spreading quickly. This solution is a well advised decision 
5105	Firstly, they won't fall behind in classes when they are too ill to be in a public space. 
5106	Secondly, they can still receive their education when they don't have proper transportation 
5107	Lastly, they can still interact with classmates and teachers in an unconventional setting. 
5108	Cold and flu season comes every year, leaving those who are unfortunate enough to have caught it, unable to attend school for at least a week, or however long a doctor recommends they should stay home. When these students come back to school, they are bombarded with make-up work that needs to be completed as soon as possible. Classes don't stop for students when they take a leave of absence. If students were able to attend online school, they wouldn't have to catch up on work because they would still be able to do it at home with the proper instructions and could still ask for help when needed. Teachers can get sick as well, sudden symptoms can make teachers leave abruptly without assigning work for students or leaving notes for substitutes. This sets students behind and could be prevented if students could attend online classes 
5109	Making online school a plausible option would also promote better attendance because students wouldn't have to physically be at school to be marked present. 
5110	While having the best intentions, public transit is often unreliable and falls short when needed. School buses can be later than they claim to be, resulting in students waiting outside in harsh weather, buses can come earlier than planned, leaving students deserted, there are times where substitute bus drivers, that aren't familiar with the streets, stray from the route, and even instances where students have to walk long distances to simply reach a bus stop 
5111	All of these inconveniences could be easily avoided if students could complete their work from home. Colleges offer online classes for students that are unable to be on campus or students that need flexible schedules. Schools could resemble the same structure college classes have to better adjust to the students. 
5112	There are some people who believe that attending school in a conventional setting is essential to students so that they can interact with others and understand topics with face to face lessons 
5113	Giving students the ability to complete their school work from home is a perfect teaching opportunity and a useful skill to familiarize students with. 
5114	With the rise of concern and media coverage for diseases and viruses such as the Coronavirus, schools around the world are considering online schooling for students. This would be a precaution to prevent diseases and viruses from spreading in a large crowd. Students would in fact benefit from being able to attend online classes from home for many reasons. Firstly, they would still receive their education, even when they are at risk for spreading an illness they may have acquired. Secondly, they can still learn when they don't have access to transportation. Lastly, they still attain the people skills learned in the school environment. Schools are becoming more technology based every year, this just might be the next step. 
5115	In conclusion, my point is not to require students for community service. Because it's just of course like forcing us again. For what I heard , slavery wasn't allowed in United States. We should get the right to do as we may, according to the law. Not everything , but in this case, we have the right to say no for educated students to perform community service by will. Some good may take in this course, but not all good. Though you think it'll be good for us students, learn some things. But for us, it's unfair and cruel. Somehow if you're volunteering as I wrote. It's okay because that's by their choice. So as I write this again, I say no to requiring students of our age and skill to do community service.      
5116	Driverless cars may seem like a thing of the future, but they are much closer than most people seem to believe. Many different companies such as Google, Tesla, Audi, and many more have already built and tested their own models. However, many people are wondering whether self-driving cars are a help or a danger to society. 
5117	Driverless cars are the next step in automotive technology and the research on them should continue because they will be safer and more efficient than cars driven by human drivers.  
5118	Every human makes a mistake at some point in his or her life. Whether they are distracted by something they see or they fall asleep at the wheel, people will make errors; it is part of our nature. On the other hand, computers function on data and do not make nearly the amount of mistakes as people. 
5119	That is why self-driving cars will make roads safer and lead to less damage. Driverless cars take data they recieve from sensors, cameras, and GPS and they use this information to pick the smartest way to keep occupants safe on the road. Also the automated systems like driver assitance and antilock brakes that are already inside cars have proven that these programs will make driving safer. For example, antilock brakes function by detecting and then reacting to skids by apply brakes and reducing engine power. Therefore the driver is better able to avoid hazards and maintain control in dangerous situations. Google has also already tested some of their semi-driverless cars and these vehicles have not crashed in half a million miles. As proven by already installed automated features, technology will continue to make drivers and passangers safer. The next step in this technology is a self-driving car that will limit the amount of error that can be cost lives. 
5120	Global warming is a problem that needs to be dealt with and one of the major culprits of it is the exhaust from diesel burning cars. The cars that Google is manufacturing are attempting to use half the fuel of a regular car while providing a safer function. With computers that can regulate exhaust, it is not too hard to imagine in the near future, if given more research, that a self-driving car could accomplish such a feat. Driverless cars would also be more efficient in that they would cut down on transportation time between destinations. Using GPS features, an autonomous car could calculate the quickest route to a destination and it would never miss a turn. Self-driving cars would not only be more fuel-efficient and help save the environment, but they also would be more time efficient. 
5121	Safety and efficiency are a few of the reasons why autonomous cars should continue to be reseached and developed. Many automoble manufacters are already producing mostly independent driving cars and soon they will become common place. By 2020 most major car producers plan to have a autonomous car model. That is not to say that everyone needs to have a self-driving, but those who do purchase one of these vehicles will not only help themselves, but they will also help others and the world around them. 
5122	I highly urge you to take some things into consideration before making your final decision on the policy change. Many students participating in sports have a C grade average. If you change the policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have a B grade average, many students will not have anything they participate in besides school. How healthy could that be? It isn't. 
5123	I believe you should make a policy that allows anyone with a C grade average or higher allowed to participate in sports and other activities. If they have a D or F grade average, then I agree that they should spend more of their time working on school work so they don't fail, but why make the students be above average just to participate in something besides school? I have three important reasons for pressing the matter. 
5124	if the students are not near the risk of failing, they should have the chance to participate in sports and other activities. 
5125	sometimes being in a sport helps students to have better concentration and energy, which will cause them to be better in school. 
5126	if students have something to participate in they will be more willing to try harder in school. 
5127	Now that you understand my reasons for wanting to avoid the change in policy, please think a little harder about it. If C's are average, why change that? Being a sport or other activity, may sometimes give the students more concentration and energy therefore, help them to do better in school. If students have something to participate in, wouldn't they want to try harder? 
5128	To take away all of their right to use a cell phone during school hours would limit them to not being able to do this while eating lunch or having a free period. 
5129	If a student is unsure if their parents can pick them up from school or not when they aren't taking the bus, it is necessary to contact either their mom or dad to see if they can get home quickly after school ends. 
5130	Sometimes, when a student isn't able to call a parent, they end up waiting for an hour or more outside the school until he/she is picked up from school. Students need to be able to use cell phones for situations like these, especially when they much homework to complete for school because then they have less time to do their required work. 
5131	Another reason why students should be allowed to use their cell phones during lunch and free times is because many are involved with some sort of after school activity. 
5132	Whether it's a sport, musical instrument, or anything else, events within that activity are often scheduled last minute or without the student knowing days ahead of time. When this happens, they may not have transportation to the location if it is not held at the same school. In this scenario, students should be able to contact a parent or friend who can drive them to wherever they need to be. 
5133	The last reason why I think you should choose Policy 1 is because students need to take a break from working constantly and make plans with friends 
5134	Students have so much homework to do when they come home from school, and sometimes it can become overwhelming. Students need to be able to spend time with friends after school and not be always thinking of all the work that needs to get done by the next day. Taking a short break is helpful and make them feel less stressed about their schoolwork. So, students should also be able to use their cell phones to call or text friends to schedule activities together. They can even study for an upcoming test or quiz together, so they can get a higher grade. 
5135	Overall, Policy 1 is a better policy because it still allows students to sometimes contact others with their cell phones. Today, cell phones are used by the majority of Americans multiple times. To take away their cell phones wouldn't be right. In some situations, students need them to call or text others to help them for whatever. Policy 1 works best because they have the chance to contact parents or friends when they need to, but they won't get distracted during class when they are turned off. This policy allows them to take care of anything they may need to, yet still be able to focus in class. 
5136	I think that if you require students to volunteer for community service I know that some of them will be really mad because they think its a waste of time 
5137	but someday day they will look back at the day they did community service and thank their principal for requiring them to do that. 
5138	Many students of the school may have done community service. Community service may change the way a student thinks. 
5139	Lets say that their is someone in the school that never likes doing homework, you may ask that person to do some community service like taking care of something. The person at first may think like why do I have to take care of something just because I don't do my homework. If you tell them they have to volunteer in a dog shelter they wont want to do it but if you also tell them they are in charge of everything and that if anything goes wrong it would be their fault. The student will probably get scared and do everything it takes to do everything good. After community service is over he will probably be a better student by doing his homework. If the student probably did change he would probably ask to see if he could do other community service. 
5140	If a student also doesn't do their homework you may ask that person to be a teacher in another school full of kids that don't do their homework, so the kid would fell the same way the teachers fell when some of their students don't do their homework. 
5141	The student will feel very bad for their teacher, and when they come back to school they will always do their homework and say sorry to their teacher for never doing their homework. After that happens the student will go back to the school where the students don't do their homework and ask them to please do their homework. He will also tell them that he never used to do his homework but he came to this school is search of trying to change his mind about doing homework. He could also tell them that he believes in them and that everybody could do their homework and that all they had to do is try. With that little that person has done he could change a whole school and the way students fell in school. If you do your homework you could go to a good college and study something you like and becoming a very successful person in life.  
5142	Through out the world a lot of people are excited about the driverless cars that are being developed. However some of them fail to realize the negativities that come with this package. 
5143	While your car is in driverless mode what are you doing? You could be texting, eating, writing something down, or for heavens sake you could be sleeping! 
5144	Drivers will become extremely wreckless, more so than they are now. 
5145	When in a vehicle the driver makes commands whether to turn or to signal a turn signal. Now give the vehicle control and you are giving it control of your life and whatever passengers you have with you. 
5146	The car is not perfected. It will most likely make countless mistakes. Technology failure being a main one. While you are texting or turned around the engine could die out or the brakes could go haywire. Your instincts will tell you to take the wheel and try to get it under control, what if the commands are inconclussive and won't respond. Who is to blame, the vehicle for shorting out or the driver for becoming too un-alert. 
5147	Technology is everywhere these days. In our pockets, on our tables and counters, everywhere we turn. You're using technology right now, as you read this. One of the most important types of technology we have is our cell phones. Everyone from 10-year-olds to 100-year-olds have them. To some people, it's just to connect with friends, to others, it's what their whole career depends on it. Either way, cell phones are a key element in today's society.  Teenagers, out of everyone, are typically the age group that most depends on their cell phones. Whether it's just for talking to friends, communicating with their boss, or speaking with their family, there's no denying it. Teenagers love their cell phones. 
5148	One reason students should be allowed to have phones is in case there is an emergency. 
5149	If something terrible were to happen to a students family, they should be able to contact the student immediately. How could they do so without a cell phone? This also true if it were backwards, and there was an emergency at school. If something were to happen that left the school's administration physically unable to hell the students, how could students get help? With cell phones, they would be able to contact their families and emergency medical services. 
5150	Another reason students should be allowed to have cell phones in school is the fact that schedules are constantly changing 
5151	Whether it's due to weather, illness, or anything else, plans often get changed in the blink of an eye. If the students don't have cell phones, the administration of the school has to coordinate plans and arrange for a student to have a ride home. With everything else the administration has to do, this seems like a foolish way of doing things. If students had cell phones, each student could individually arrange when and where to have their ride pick them up. 
5152	I believe that the electoral college should not be kept because it is an unfair system of voting. There are flaws in the electoral college system that make it an unfair system to choose our president. 
5153	Some of the things that are wrong with the electoral college are that voters can't control whom their electors vote for 
5154	in case of a tie there is not a fair way to pick the president 
5155	the winner-take-all system is unfair to voters. 
5156	In the electoral college voters aren't essentially voting for a president but they are voting for a group of electors who will then elect a president. The electors can be picked in many different ways. Sometimes they are they are picked at state conventions, they can be picked at state party's central committe, or sometimes the presidental canidate picks them themselves according to Bradford Plumer (source 2). 
5157	Plumer says that voters can't always control who their electors vote for and sometimes voters get confused on who to vote for. 
5158	If there was a tie in the election, the election would be given to the House of Representatives. In that election, each state has only one vote. So a state with a bigger population has the same say than a state with a smaller population. According to Plumer, because many voters vote one party for president and another party for Congress, the House's selection will not entirely reflect the will of the people. A tie in the electoral college is possible beacause the amount of electoral votes is 538 which is an even number (source 3). 
5159	Counterclains suggest that because the election depends on the vote of swing states, voters there are more thoughtful and should be the ones to decide how the election goes (Richard A. Posner, source 3). 
5160	Sensors on the car can keep you from danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers. 
5161	The anitlock brake and driver assticance system has made its own way on helping the full invention of driverless cars. 
5162	"Sebastian Thrun, founder of the Google Car project, believes that with the technolgy progressing consumers can have a driverless cab take us wherever we would like to go. Along with the sensors the radar will help with the antilock system to make that dream come ture.  BMW has already annouced the development of ""Traffic Jam Assistant"". It's a car the can handle driving up to 25 mph, but touch sensors keeps the driver holding the wheel in case of a malfunction. The human driver must remian alert and be able to take over in certain situations. Manufacturers are also considering using cameras to watch that drivers are remaining focused on the road. "
5163	Several may argue that a driverless car is not safe. 
5164	A variety of car companies have and are developing safety devices to assure the safety of everyone. GM has developed drivers seats that vibrate when the vehicle is in danger of backing into an object. The Google car simply announces when the driver should be prepared to take over. Other options under consideration are flashing lights on the windshield and other heads-up displays. Automakers and manufacturers are assuring your safety while deveopling the future. 
5165	Safety is the number one key to the adevances of driverless cars. From sensors, antilock brake and driver assistance systems, and development for the advanced technology; automakers and manufacturers are assuring your safety. That is why they are developing the technology further to insure that consumers are safe while they have made technological advances. 
5166	"I actually find that to be a wonderful idea. I mean just think about it usually students don't care, they just think ""Oh, Well I can play Football with whatever grades I might get."" Well If you make that brand new school policy you might see an extraordinary change in the grades for kids. "
5167	If you make that school policy I am sure it will make a huge difference in our grade point average. 
5168	because not only does it protect the environment it protects future generations and our community. 
5169	For example say people were not taking care of the environment and throwing their garbage and littering in our rivers and streams, which leads to our drink water it would then be contaminated and the contamination of the water wouldn't just effect humans it would effect plants and animals as well. Or say that we were not recycling, all of our garbage would do straight to landfill's which would once again put humans, plants and animals in danger. Or perhaps we were letting the oil from our cars run out into streams and driving our car to places that we could easily walk to or letting the carbon monoxide from our cars pollute the air leaving more of a chance for global warming to happen. 
5170	All of this can be prevented if we just take thirty minutes out of our day and pick up loose trash in our neighborhood or park or just as simple as recycling plastics, papers, cardboards, glasses etc. 
5171	The electoral college system is unfair 
5172	The electoral college is unfair, being that voters don't always control who their electors vote for, opposed to election by popular vote. 
5173	This is my opinion of your future change in the school activities. I'm not in favor in this change, if the students are good players, the principal have to let they play at least they have a grade C average, but if the students don't have a good grade, like F or D, the principal have to tell they that they can't play anymore, till they make a good grade.  
5174	There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which of would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner. 
5175	"""Knowledge is power,"" the esteemed Francis Bacon once said. Those words, repeated verbatim for ages, are the foundation of education, for as long as education serves to teach and inspire. However, there is an arising problem where students are unable to focus on their schooling due to external factors such as holding jobs or taking care of their families. This phenomenon causes harm to the future academic aspirations of these students and is wholly detrimental to their education. As per federal law, all children in the United States, from the ages of five to eighteen, are legally required to attend school. However, for those students who must serve a purpose other than studying, having to spend hours of their day at a physical school can actually severely affect their ability in both educational and non-educational pursuits. Although this situation may seem dire, there exists a surprisingly simple solution that can adequately meet all the needs of these students: distance learning. Distance learning is a program by which students are afforded the option of doing their coursework from home by taking online courses. By providing a feasible alternative to traditional schooling, distance learning will allow students to do better in all facets of their lives. "
5176	"While a work-life balance seems to be the cornerstone of happiness for any American worker, the same does not seem to be true for American students. In a 2016 study published by Psychology Today, it was found that the stress level of students had risen nearly 15% since 2012. This, in tandem with the fact that many high school students work part-time or even full-time jobs on the side is the exact reason why distance learning must be implemented: schedule flexibility. If students are able to shape their educational schedules to meet their unique independent needs, then the mental health of those students would doubtlessly improve. In fact, in a TED talk about a similar brand of tutelage entitled ""hack schooling"", it was discussed how the alternative method allowed for students to feel more secure about their learning as it was being done on their own terms. This means that if students are allowed the chance to shape their education to suit themselves, they are then able to comprehend the information that they learn rather than simply memorize and regurgitate it. "
5177	By removing unnecessarily strenuous factors such as the long hours and rigidity of traditional schooling, distance learning provides an avenue by which students of all backgrounds and situations are afforded the opportunity to thrive. 
5178	Independence is a trait that empowers all those who possess it as it enables them to function on their own. Between fixed bell schedules and assigned bathroom breaks and a plethora of functional rigidity, independence is rather unfortunately not a trait that is bred well in traditional American schools. However, as students grow to become adults with much more autonomy than is allowed in said schools, this dependency can become malignant to the development of their own psyches. Giving students the ability to attend a distance learning program is something that can, in turn, teach students to become more independent and self-reliant. Between managing their own time, finishing their coursework, and learning to use their online resources wisely, students will gain a learning curve which will lead them to be vastly more independent than they would have been in a traditional school setting. Take, for example, students who complete online courses via the Generic_School program in the Generic_City school district. In the form to apply for courses, students are asked how they demonstrate independence and ability to manage their coursework. As distance learning demands more in terms of organization than traditional schooling does, it is clearly vital for students to be, or at least to learn to be, more independent. 
5179	by taking these courses, students will display an increase in independence and autonomy that they would not necessarily experience in a traditional setting. 
5180	Despite the many bonuses that distance learning offers, there is something that can be said about the social aspect of traditional public schooling. By forcing students to interact with one another, traditional schools facilitate social interactions between peers. 
5181	While performing this function does seem to advantage traditional schools, it is not necessarily a bad thing for distance schooling. In fact, students are quite often put in social situations outside of a school setting. 
5182	Whether interacting with family or speaking to friends, students experience social interaction rather often in their lives. Additionally, as many distance learning programs use video conferences as a means to teach, they can provide a means to teach further social and emotional interaction as well. Schools are not the only means by which students may develop social skills, and distance learning would genuinely not hinder any sort of societal interaction or ability that traditional schools seemingly provide. 
5183	In summation, schools should implement distance learning as it serves as a vital benefit to students who genuinely cannot gain from traditional forms of education. By allowing for flexible schedules, distance learning provides a feasible alternative to students who cannot perform their tasks within the confines of traditional schools. By encouraging independence, distance learning empowers students to learn discipline and organization in addition to traditional academia. Knowledge is indeed power, and with the knowledge that educators have about distance learning, they must now enable students to experience first hand how distance learning can benefit them. 
5184	The Electoral College doesn't allow for a direct election compared to popular vote. 
5185	Also, there isn't a fair number of votes for each presidential candidate per state. 
5186	If there is a tie in the electoral voting process it can cause a big disaster. 
5187	I don't believe that anyone wants constant problems when choosing a leader. To avoids all of the problems why not take the Electoral College out overall 
5188	"""Under the electorial college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" (Paragraph 10). In actuality, voters don't directly vote for the president when it comes to the electoral college. Although the Electoral College ""restores some of the weight in the polititcal balance that large states lose by virtue of mal-apportionment"", (paragraph 21) voters don't have the right to control whom their electors are said author Bradford Plumer. Voting for a group of electors doesn't always mean that they'll vote for the candidate in which you favor. This can have a huge affect on the reputation of the Electoral College itsself. "
5189	It's not only an indirect election but it's also an unfair election. 
5190	"The number of entitled electors per state is based upon the members of the state's congressional delegation. ""One for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your senators."" (paragraph 3). This is unfair because the number of ""House"" members is based on the states overall population compared to the amount of senators. It may somehow be good for the residents who beleive their votes doesn't count becasue of the candidate's regional appeals but what about those who fear that their electors won't choose the candidate in which they favor. "
5191	Not only is it indirect and unfair, but it can cause disaster to arise if there is a tie within the electoral voting process. 
5192	"If there is a tie in the in the electoral vote ""the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives"" (paragraph 12). This is an unfair method also becasue now there's only one vote per state and some states have a higher population than others which can and will cause contreversy in the public. ""The pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, may be redcued"" (patagraph 22) but it still doesn't reduced the fact that swing voters can cause catastrophe within the electoral voting process. This is because they are the most targeted voting areas due to their reputations as the ""most thoughtful voters"". "
5193	"All in all, the Electoral college has both its good things and their downfalls. As can be seen the bad out ways the good in this situation. A voters vote isn't necessarily direct because they aren't voting on a single representative, they are voting on a group of individuals in which they believe will vote for the candidate in which they choose. Also, being that the number of electors is based on a state's number of congressional represenatives it is an unequal and unfair number of electors per state. The electoral college can even cause an uproar if a tie ever falls in place because the ""tie breaker"" is left in the hands of the House of Representatives. Basically ""the electoral colleg is unfair, and irrational"" (paragraph 14) and it should be abolished because there is a great amount of mix ups and failures within the system itself.   "
5194	When you do service for someone else they will probably thank you over and over and say how wonderful you are.  It might actually make you think twice about yourself and try harder because you know someone cares. 
5195	Driverless cars are easily possible to develop, 
5196	much safer than regular cars, 
5197	have benefits for both people and the environment. 
5198	"Driverless cars require sensors which allow them to mimic human reaction to whatever situation might arise while on the road. Sensor technology has been in development and in use since the 1980s, with the introduction of antilock brakes. Using this technology, Google modified a Toyota Prius with several sensors which allows the car to access a 3-D model of its environment. The proper technology to introduce driverless cars is clearly already available to manufacturers. In fact, in 2013, BMW announced the ""Traffic Jam Assistant,"" which allows the car to steer, accelerate, and brake itself. The world is already well on its way to the creation of a truly driverless car. "
5199	A possible cosumer concern might be that with the current model of semi-driverless cars, which still require some human effort, people may get tired or distracted waiting for their turn to drive. 
5200	However, manufacturers are developing an answer to this concern which introduces more safety than a regular driving environment would have. Some manufacturers are introducing in-car displays which turn off instantly when driver assistance is required, which is not possible with a regular cellphone or messaging device. This eliminates any in-car distraction during the driving task, With human error eliminated, driverless cars are much safer than regular ones. 
5201	Driverless cars can allow people to safely engage in other activities besides driving, allowing them to achieve and accomplish more. Driving can be tiring, and driverless cars eliminate driving as a task for people to complete. Many factors can impair driving ability and prevent one from driving, but with driverless cars, mobility is always possible, and transportation is always accessible. A Google cofounder estimates that driverless cars can eventually eliminate the need for personal cars at all, by introducing a public transportation system of entirely driverless vehicles, and that these vehicles can use half the fuel of current taxis. This can have huge benefits for the environment. 
5202	I beleive that we should throw out the electoral colledge and not use it anymore. Today it is irrelevant and it does not help out the elections, in fact I think it only causes trouble.  
5203	The people vote for who they want to in the main election and then by popular vote is usually what party gets to send the electors that would vote for them(source 1 ph 5-8). An example of this is the famous 2000 election. That election Al Gore and George Busch were facing off fo the right to hold office. Now Al Gore had won by popular vote, but instead what happened is the electoral colledge voted in favor of Busch instead of Al Gore(posner  ph16). So this shows that Gore should have won because he had the most votes by the american people, but then the electoral colledge voted someone else. So why did the people even vote if the person they wanted in office did not even make it in. That is why we should do away with the electoral colledge. 
5204	"A world full of driverless cars seems a thousand years away; the thought of being able go anywhere at anytime without driving or a driver seems to be science fiction. However, with recent advancements in the field of driverless automoblies, this fantasy can exist sooner than one might think. With the Google Car program and BMW's ""Traffic Jam Assistant,"" the world of driverless cars may almost be here. "
5205	"I believe that development and research for the creation of truly automatic transportation should be continued, based on information from ""Driverless Cars Are Coming: "
5206	the safety implications and solutions, 
5207	the options for making driving a better experience. 
5208	The issue of the safety of automoblies is still relevant to driverless cars as well. If there is a situation that the driverless car cannot handle, there could be accidents and damage. However, driverless car developers continue to address this problem, and solutions have been proposed. BMW has announced that they have developed a car that can drive itself for speed up to 25 mph. They also require that the driver keep attention to the wheel, and will notify if there is a situation where the driver must take over. This allows the driver to navigate work zones or around accidents, increasing the safety of the driverless car. The car can alert the driver in several ways, so the driver can always know when it is necessary to drive. 
5209	With more development, the cars can be better prepared to handle situations and know when to notify the driver, increasing the safety of the experience.  
5210	With the invention of the driverless car, the driving experience can change in new ways. 
5211	The aspect of driving a driverless car allows the driving fun to be interpreted in diferent ways. This especcially proves true for in-car entertainment options. With cars that can notifty the driver whenever there is a situation to take over, the driver can relax and use in-car entertainment and information systems safely. These increase the driving experience and what the driver or passangers can do, without endangering people or property. As more development is made, the driving experience can change to make driving better for all; a time to relax or have fun, while maintaining safety. 
5212	With so many advancements in driverless cars, a world run by driverless cars is a possibility. The invention of driverless cars, safety solotions, and an increase in the driving experience all show that with development and research, truly driverless cars can be achieved. I believe that development on driverless cars should continue, so that they can be perfected and put into use, making driving better for everyone. 
5213	As a student I want the best for the up coming generations, including me, that are going to be able to be a part of the presidential elections and to not be confused who to vote for or how the electoral college works. Every year a new generation becomes legal to vote and be part of the election but if they dont know how to vote or how it works then they wont be able to. Some people dont know anything about poitics but, still want to be able to vote so, it should be easy for them to vote for who they want to be president rather then the long process of, voting for the canidates elector and most of the time they dont vote for who they want and they vote for the wrong person.         
5214	I do think that students should be required to do community service. 
5215	Students should take care of their community by keeping it clean. 
5216	Performing community service can help student get jobs in the future. 
5217	The final reason is that it'll just make them feel good about themselves knowing they've helped out their community.  
5218	Say you write down that you've worked in a soup kitchen or at a local retirement home it will more likely get you a better career. It might take some time out of your day but even when your helping those in need at the end of the day you really just helped yourself. 
5219	If you help a mentally disabled or physically disabled person that is less fortunate than you understand that you have more than you can ask for while some others don't even have a home, a good brain, or even body parts. If you help the needy and you say to your parents this is nice helping others they'll look at you as a more mature adult knowing that now you know not to take anything for granted and enjoy all the little things. 
5220	Do you think that the Electoral College prosses is practical? Do you think that it is okay for someone else to vote for us? 
5221	Well, I dont think that it is right, and there are some reasons I am about to tell you that may change your mind about the whole process of voteing and electing a president. 
5222	Here are a few points I am going to cover in this essay about Electoral Colleges: over sixty percent of people do not agree with the electoral process 
5223	it it outdated and not accurate 
5224	the electorers have proven to be untrustworthy in the past. 
5225	Most people dont really understand what the Electoral College is, or what it is about, so let me just inform you about it a little. The Electoral College is a process that was established in the constitution and it is a strategy that we use to elect out presidents. The citizens vote for the president, but so the the electors in the Electoral College. There are over five hundred members of the Electoral College, and if a canadate wants to win presidency, he/she has to gain 270 of the Electoral College's votes. Each person running has a set of their own electors 
5226	Many people believe that this should not be used as a way to elect a president because in the past, the Electoral Collage made Gore loose the presidental election because although he had more popular votes than Goerge Bush, he has less electoral votes. 
5227	Another reason why I dont think that we should keep the Electoral College is because so many people disagree with it 
5228	Everyone has their own reason for not liking it, but sixty percent of American voters agree that we should not have it and we need to find a new system for electing presidents. Most people lost repect for the Electoral College after what happened with Bush and Gore, but many people think that it is old and outdated, and that it doesn't really make any snese to use it and that it is irrational. I'm not saying that just because a lot of people don't like something, that we should change it, I'm just explaining that if only fourty percent of the nation agrees with something, then maybe the majority should win! 
5229	Some people might say that the Electoral College was put in the consitution and that we should keep using the process because we've had it for so long, 
5230	but with time, things change, and just because we've used something for a long time, doesn't mean we shouldn't upgrade. 
5231	This is why I think that we should get rid of the Electoral Congress, too many people disagree with it, there are many flaws in the system and it is old and outdated. I hope that I have swayed your opinion and that you are part of the sixty percent of Americans who are hungry for change.    
5232	It would give pupils a chance to interact with others and create a foundation that could prove to be helpful to them as a reference in future situations such as going to college or finding a job. 
5233	As someone already participating in high school sports and tutoring my peers, I think it is safe to say from my perspective that little things like this do make a huge difference in who you are as a person and as a studen 
5234	However, the electoral college is flat out taking away our right to share our thoughts about the future leaders of the nation. The electoral college is irrational, and unfair.  
5235	The most basic reason why the electoral college is unfair to our country is because not everyone is fairly represented. 
5236	For example, there are 55 representatives in California to represent 35 million voters. As you can see, it is an unfair ratio. It is impossible for the House's votes to reflect the views of the people in California. That also means that since each state only has one fianl vote, a state such as Wyoming, who has 500,000 voters, would have as much say as California, with 35 million. California has more people, and my making every state have equal representation, it is messing up representation in states like California. 
5237	In the system we have today, it is very easy to have a dealocked election. 
5238	In 1968, a mere 41,971 votes would have caused a major deadlock in the election. The same thing happened again in 1976, if 5,559 votes in Ohio and 3,687 votes in Hawaii decided to vote differently. In both cases, and few thousand votes could have caused a serious disaster. History tends to repeat itself, so if the almost exact situation happened in the span of less than ten years, what makes you think it won't happen again? 
5239	If the people are barely being represented, and a state with less than a million voters has as much say as a state with 35 million voters, then it doesn't matter if the process gives a clear winner. 
5240	The electoal college may have been a good idea back when it was first created, however, times are changing and the number of people being able to vote is growing day by day. The voters want to give their opinion through voting, and by having the electoral college in place, it is making voting unfair, irrational, and nearly impossible to do 
5241	Like if you play sports and have practice from right after school to about 5:30 and then you try to do community service. 
5242	The electoral college has been around for as long as our nation has reined over this land. I fervently believe we should keep the electoral college as it is. We, as people, are not ready for the responability of choosing our next leader directly viva popular vote. Some of us might be ready for this responability now, but the magority of America cannot handel this responibity. The majority has stared riots over lost football games, acknolaged said riots and justifyed them then turn around and see a riot about a kid being shot 6 times by an officer and send in swat teams and start throwing smoke bombs. Because of these actions and the many like it, 
5243	I whole-heartedly believe if we leave the responability to chose our president in the magority vote that this country will become more unstable than it already it 
5244	most people already do not vote 
5245	I  belive that my state senator should remove the electoral colleges. To change the election by popular vote for the president of the United States. 
5246	For the fact that voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors. Who can always defy the will of the people. 
5247	It should also be removed because its simply unfair to the voters. There votes may or may not be counted 
5248	may vote for the wrong person or oppsite party. 
5249	Also the problem comes up that the candidates do no go to there state thus never seeing them. 
5250	For the reson that voter are not voteing but for a slate of electors. Who then elect the president, 
5251	"for example ""if you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for John Kerry. You'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry.""(qoute form source 2) Those 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry may not win the statewide election. The voters also are not always able to control who there electors vote for. ""Legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people."" (qoute form source 2). So there a chance they may change there mind and the president they wished to win may not win because the legislatures do not have to vote in there favor. In some case seventeen states didn't even see the candidates at all. Some states including Rhode Island and South Carolina, ""and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" "
5252	"For example the winner takes all system in each state. Candidates don't spend times in the states they know they have no chance winning. ""It can be argued that the Electoral college method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state."" (qoute from source 3). "
5253	But then what happens to the people in that wants to vote for them but can't because there votes go toward a slate of electors that votes for the other party. They focus on the swing states mostly. 
5254	For Instance a Presidential race that happen were the electoral votes caused a certain party to win was. In 2000 U.S. presidential race, Al Hore received more in dividual votes than George W. Bush nationwide, but Bush won the election, receiving 271 electoral votes to Gore's 266. 
5255	The electoral votes need to be removed because it causes problems in elections which makes any side able to win even though they don't have more individual votes. 
5256	"Another example is ""Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast on him."" (qoute from sorce 3) .  Study shows that 60% of voters would prefer a direct election rather then what they have now. "
5257	On the other hand having the electoral votes may not be such a bad thing. The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. The Electoral College also restore some of the weight in the political balance that large states. 
5258	If you elect a good representive that you belive, and trust that will vote to your liking. Someone that would not turn his back on the will of the people then it would not be that bad. The process they go throught maybe difficult and hard to understand. So it could be a good thing they take the hard work off our backs and do it for us to save us the time and hardwork. The Electoral Colleges requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal rather then a single region appeal. 
5259	To conclude I belive that my state senator should remove the electoral colleges. To change the election by popular vote for the president of the United States. For the fact that voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors. Who can always defy the will of the people. It should also be removed because its simply unfair to the voters. There votes may or may not be counted or may vote for the wrong person or oppsite party. The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational.    
5260	One reason students like I and others should be required to perform community service is because right now in this economy its very hard for people to make ends meet for their family and themselves. 
5261	People are becoming homeless, going days without eating, nearly starving, wearing the same clothes everyday and they cant do nothing about it because there are no jobs that they can take. People are being laid-off from their jobs which are leading to those events. If we have community service we will be able to make sure they don't go to bed with their bellies empty, we could make sure that they have a roof over their heads at night, and give them clean clothes to keep. This can really touch peoples hearts and if you were in the same position you would want somebody to do the same thing. 
5262	Another reason students like I and others should be required to perform community service is because we need to clean up our community. 
5263	"Its like now of day people just litter and like nothing happened. In my mind i want to scream out "" do you know you are killing the earth""?. So it would be a good thing to clean up our neighborhood because we live here too, along we the people who litter. People also Vandalize property out on the street that don't belong to them. We should go around cleaning up walls with spray paint remover because nobody wants to walk around and see that. It remind you that you can even have nothing without it getting messed up and at times make u feel unsafe. "
5264	The canidate wouldn't have to worry about losing even though he won the popular vote, 
5265	it would be less likely to get a tie 
5266	the canidate would have to campain in every state because there wouldn't be a winner-takes-all situation. 
5267	Most importantly the canidate wouldn't have to worry about losing even though they received the popular vote 
5268	The reprsentative electors have the final say in who is elected because they are the ones that put in the votes. An example of this is Al Gore back in 2000. According to some polls Al Gore lost the election thanks to the electoral college because he won the popular vote but still lost the election. Al Gore had recieved more individual votes than George W. Bush but still lost. Geoerge W. Bush had 271 electoral votes to Al Gore's 266. However, this is not the last time this will happen and voters can expect to see it happen again in the future were the popular vote winner loses the presidency. 
5269	Not only can they win the popular vote but still lose the presidency, they also risk the event of a tie were the vote would then go to the House of Representatives. 
5270	In the event of a tie meaning that each canidate got an equal number of votes from the electors the House of Representatives would have the oppurtunity to vote for the president. This is not a fair system in any way because that would mean the representative for Wyoming who is only representing 500,000 thousand people would have as much say as a representative from California who is there representing 35 million voters! There has been many close incidents of a tie so it is possible for this to happen. In 1968 a shift of 41,971 votes would have put the election in a tie. In 1976, id 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 in Hawaii would have voted the other way then the race for presidency would have gone into the hands of the House. 
5271	Furthermore the canidates would have to campaign in every state because there wouldn't be winner-takes-all which means the winner of the electoral votes gets all the votes within that state even if some of the residents did not vote for that party 
5272	"The canidates would have to campaign in every state rather than just the ""swing"" states which are people that have not yet decided which way they wanted to vote. the cenidates dont campaign in a state if they know that they have no chance of winning the electoral votes in that state. During the 2000 election a remarkable seventeen states did not see the campaign one time nor did the people in the 25 largest media markets see a campaign ad whether it be on t. v., in the newspaper, or over the radio. If the president was elected by popular vote than every state would be considered a swing state. "
5273	I am writing this letter to you today to talk to you about Electoral College and election by popular vote. I feel very strongly on this topic as it is something I  know I  will come in contact with when i have the right to vote in the near future.  As we look back to the very day the Constitution was written, it has been a comprise that between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizen that fifve hundred and thirty eight electorshave a meeting for they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress, as stated by the Office of the Federal Register. 
5274	it will give them a harder drive to make good grades and do good in school 
5275	Then again some of the teams best players may not be able to make a B average. this will make teams much small and sports not near as exciting or fun for the spectators who watch these games. very many parents my not be happy about their child not being able to play on a team, 
5276	but school should be more important to these parents who's kids are not achieving a B average.  
5277	On the other hand their will be many mad students and parents because that student is not able to play the sport that he or she may love. and also the coaches may get mad too because one of his or her best plays may not be making the grades that he or she needs to make to play this sport. 
5278	This would probably only happen for a couple of years or sport seasons but after awhile everything would be back to normal and it would be just like anything else in the world and people would begin to grow to the B average rule that the principle has. 
5279	I think in the end that this would be a good thing because it would make students want to try harder in school if they really like a sport and wanted to bring their grade up to be able to play this sport. Then again i think every school should have to have this rule because it would be unfair to one team if the other team did not have the players they wanted because of this rule. I think you could take this rule and put it into school systems and see improvement all over the state then maybe all over the country. So yes i think that even though it would cause a lot of trouble it would be a good thing to raise grades all over the country. 
5280	I believe that human driven cars will soon be a thing of the past, and that the development of these new vehicles will be the new normal. 
5281	Vehicles without human drivers is the next big thing in society. 
5282	Many car companies and other organizations have decided to fund a driverless car. 
5283	I beieve that it is the right thing to do, and that all will benefit from the experience. At some point, many will realize that computers are smarter than humans in many ways. Even though many think that the computers will have internal failure and create issues, I do not think that is the case. Companies involved in this new technology will test the product far before the release of any of their final product. The last thing they want is to have a disaster of driverless car failure. The fact that people support these ideas rather than oppose them shows that the majority of the population will want these vehicles on the street. The advancements that are currently being made and the support of the public make a point. Completely driverless cars will be here soon, and it is only a matter of time before everyone is introduced. 
5284	Autonomous cars are soon to be here, and soon everyone will recognize the new technology rolling around the streets. The acknowlegement of this accomplishment is astounding to all that try to understand it. This is the new normal, and it is sure to go on for years to come. Everyone will want to see a car that no one has to drive. This is how far technology and understanding has gotten people. Never in anyone's wildest dreams did they think of a car without a human behind the wheel. Now, people do not have to try to believe it. They are going to have to accept and understand that it is happening 
5285	Electoral College has been an efiicient way that has been around for years to select reperesentatives in each state that may have a bigger chance in politics in the future. As the people of one country, we are able to get our voices heard throughtout the world. The Electoral College contains people who you are able to trust, the people who can express their political views very clearly, and that it provides political balance throughout.  
5286	As common technology improves and computers get smarter, sensors get more accurate, and technology becomes more reliable, the driverless cars stand more of a chance against the roads of today. 
5287	The current technology, used to make driverless cars a possibility, is good enough for easy going roads and still rely on a driver to take overat times. 
5288	"In the passage it states, ""Further improvements in sensors and computer hardware and software to make driving safer are also leading to cars that can handle more and more driving tasks on their own"". This points out that as time goes by and things move along in sensors for safety, things in the driverless catagory are getting more accurate to prevent mishaps. Driverless cars are also helped out by the fact that they can get to the point of being able to drive far more accuratly that any human driver, but it may take some time for technology to reach this level of accuracy. "
5289	Semi-driverless cars are a thing that can just be in the backround to aid drivers in situations and provide them with a way to get away from the stress of traffic, making them better drivers. 
5290	Most lawmakers are against the use of driverless cars on public roads because of a safety concerns, 
5291	but the developers have said that anything that exists today are still not entirely drivereless and cannot handle most things that apear in driving. 
5292	"In the passage is says, ""...but so far, Google cars aren't truly driverless; they still alert the driver to take over when pulling in and out of driveways or dealing with complicated traffic issues"". This means that things are not perfect and still require a driver behind the wheel. If everything worked perfect, the driverless cars would be the best drivers on the roads today due to their inceaced accuracy and speed at which they can make decisions. "
5293	Driverless cars should be allowed to operate on public roadways. The technology behind them, once perfected, will provide the safest cars avaliable today by avoiding the crashes. Times change and the laws should be changed to follow time and the new technology that follows. Even though the newest technology isn't the best right now, it should be given time to grow and mature into the technology of tomorow to provide the safest driving experience. 
5294	Driving a car can be very difficult sometimes with all the traffic, getting a phone call, not seeing a pedestrian and many other things that a driver has to be aware of when driving. As technology keeps improving these cars keep improving as well. These driverless cars could make driving easier for humans, more enjoyable and more safe and they could also change the world and the way we live by providing us with all these advantages that are not available at the moment. Manufacturers should keep improving these cars and the states should change the law and make the driving of these cars legal.      
5295	I believe your second policy on cell phones is the best choice. From being a student and experiencing what students do, your second policy is the right choice 
5296	I think that if you allow students to use cell phones during free times, they will abuse this rule and sneak their phones to class 
5297	My second reason is that students must pay attention to their school work, rather than their friends 
5298	my last reason is that students will get into trouble being allowed to use them in school 
5299	From being a student in school for many years, I know that your second policy is the better choice because kids my abuse the rules, won't be concentrating on their work, and they will get in trouble. 
5300	If students are allowed the use of cell phones during free time only, most would abuse this policy. 
5301	During lunch or free time, children will have conversations on their phones with their friends. After lunch, these students will still be in a conversation and will continue it. Students will be sneaking their phones into classes just to finish talking to their friends. This policy will be abused by these kids and more and more kids will have phones in class than intended. 
5302	Banning phones in school is the right choice because school is a place of learning. 
5303	If students do use their cell phones, they will not be paying attention to the teacher or what they need to know. Without the second policy, students' grades will drop lower and lower because they are not learning what they need to. This is just one more reason why the only way to go is to ban phones in schools at all times. 
5304	If cell phones are allowed in school, there is a chance that children will get into trouble 
5305	Many stories have been heard on the news about teenagers getting hurt from cell phone use. If students are allowed to use cell phones, who's to say they will always use them properly. Phones should be modified by parents so that their children are safe. The second policy is the only choice because it will prevent the dangers of phone use from happening. 
5306	As a current student in middle school, I have learned how children use cell phones. If you are reconsidering the cell phone policy, I believe the second one is the only way to go. Children in this school may sneak their cell phones into class without the teacher ever knowing if they are not banned. This will also lead to students doing poorly in class because they won't be paying attention to the teacher. Also, the use of cell phones in a wrong way can cause a student to get hurt. Overall, I believe your second policy to ban cell phones in class is the best choice because after being a student in school, I know what will happen if they are allowed in school. 
5307	"Accoriding to bradford plumer he qoutes that "" The single  best argument against the electoral colloge is what we might call the disatser factor"" (source 2). Even though electors votes it can lead to more of an unoraginized distaster. it can mainly lead to a lot of confusion and miss counts. a lot of people do not like the fact of electors being one just like the presidnet of untied states. "
5308	Dear Florida senator, we should keep the Electoral College. The Electoral College has been around for decades, produced by the founding fathers, it was made as a compromise between the two different ways the president should be elected. One way being by a slate of senators, and another by simply popular vote. It was made so that citizens could still have their vote, but more politically advanced senators could make a decision. 
5309	I favor the Electoral College instead of popular vote because it helps avoid run-off elections, 
5310	gives equal oppourtunity to smaller states. 
5311	Run-off elections, as known as, the gigantic issue with a popular vote election system 
5312	In 1968, Nixon, and in 1992, Clinton, both only had about 43 percent of the popular votes which was not enough. This is a problem because it complicates the presidential electon process. This is where the Electoral College comes in hand; the outcome of the votes becomes very clear this way 
5313	". Instead of dealing with tricky numbers and percentages, the electoral college uses the ""winner-takes-all"" method. "
5314	The winner-takes-all method is as literal as it sounds; the winner takes all. For example if someone was running for president and they got 301 votes and 370 electoral college votes, they would win (you only need a majority of 270 votes to be elected. 
5315	Lastly, using the Electoral College benefits smaller states 
5316	Think of this, you live in Maine, or Hawaii, or somewhere with a smaller population than Florida or California- your state would not have really that much of a impact on who wins the electon. Although, you cannot choose who your state senators in the end vote for, there's a greater chance of your state having a bigger impact. It naturally balences out some of the more heavier politically impacting states. Even though things are equal, in the long run larger states (population wise) will get more attention than states with a smaller population. 
5317	I think that it isn't right to change the school policy because some students cant pull there grade up to a B or higher. 
5318	i think that it should stay the way it is because a C is still a passing grade and its hard to focus on 2 things at once 
5319	I beleive that students will benefit in many ways from more schools offering distance learning as an option to attand class from home. 
5320	It gives students, at home sick, the opportunity to keep up with the pace of the class, instead of missing a day. 
5321	Many schools are currently integrating technology into learning wherever possible, with adding this option other perks come with it such as extra help from teachers after hours and the ability to partake in discussion. 
5322	Distance learning also benefits students that may suffer from social anxiety or bullying, they would now have the option to learn from a very comfortable and familiar environment. 
5323	When students miss school due to illness, they miss out on the lessons taught that day and are put in a position where their education is rushed and this affects how well the content is learned 
5324	Many schools recently have prioritized integrating technology in the classroom wherever possible, and have seen the benefits from doing so. 
5325	Students who suffer from social anxiety, or are bullied in school may also benefit from distance learning. 
5326	We should keep the elcetoral college 
5327	it has been around for so long that it would be difficult getting use to the change. By keeping the electoral college we keep a non-democratic way of voting for out presidents 
5328	it has become apparent to me that some kids are not on board with the idea of it and think its to much work for to little pay-out. How-ever I do not agree with them 
5329	the kids that say these things are the slackers they are board at school don't do their home work get bad grades and so-on, 
5330	but community service is a good thing to do 
5331	I do think that kids should be able to chose how much they do with a minimum amount of 3 hours. 
5332	This would let the kids who challenge themselves continue to do so, and let the slackers become more used to the idea of work. 
5333	Now i' m not saying that there isn't a little bit of slacker in every one 
5334	but to be successful in the job market these day you want to be a hard working individual who doesn't mind doing something for others. 
5335	Dear Senator: I'am writing you this letter to inform you that I argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College. Why? 
5336	Well, I think all the students from fifth grade and up should take on the responsibility of doing community service for their school 
5337	community service should not be required in school, 
5338	this is because some people who do not have a lot of time on their hands would go crazy trying to perhaps juggle school projects, homework, out of school jobs that take up most of their day. 
5339	So tell me how all of our students who do all of these things and then would have to put community service on top of that i think not Mr. principal sir. that is just wrong. 
5340	So what I am thinking is to go to every teacher in the building and see what students work there hardest and what students don't and try to see who have after school jobs and who doesn't. and the people who do not work hard all day every day they should be the students doing community service not the hard working students.  
5341	Helping the community is very important, and I'm sure many people think that. There are many citizens that volunteer for community services such as picking up litter, tutoring children, helping in soup kitchens, etc. 
5342	As important as community service is, I do not believe it should be mandatory 
5343	Many students have other extra curricular activities, and jobs in or out of the house they must participate in. 
5344	Therefore, I'm sure these students don't have the time after school to do community service. If those kids had to do community service, it would most likely add stress to their lives and give them less time to do homework, so their grades could begin to slip. On the weekends is when kids relax and have fun with their friends and family, so it wouldn't be a good idea to make community service time on the weekend.  
5345	The Electoral college is corrupt and needs to go away. 
5346	The people of America dont like the Electoral college and want something new. 
5347	"Stated in source 2, "" Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore-thanksto the quirks of the electoral college- won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent off voters would prefer a dirt election to the kind we have now."" In short, people were so unhappy with the election and the way it ended. people would rather have direct voting than to continure with an Electoral college. "
5348	"They can lie, cheat, they go behind the backs of the states citizens and not  even vote for who the citizens want. In 1960, segregationists in the lousiana legislature tried to get rid of the democratic electors. They wanted to replace them with people who would oppose John F Kennedy. Sourse 2, number 11 says ""In some vein, faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whoever they please..."" This means that with an Electoral college, the person you want to vote for may not even get picked cause of lying electors. "
5349	Even though the electoral college is a pretty bad thing, there are still a few upsides. The Electoral college avoids te problem of neither candidates getting a majority of the votes. 
5350	In conclusion, The Electoral college may not be the best thing for our society, and also can we even trust that our votes even matter? either the Electoral college cant be trusted and it needs to be gone for good, or something needs to change.    
5351	Imagine the following scenario: you wake up in the morning and there is two feet of snow on the ground. You turn on the television and your local news station reports that your school is closed today, so rather than spending a wasteful snow day doing nothing and having to make up seat time later in the year, you log onto your computer and connect with your teachers and classmates via video chat. In many schools in the United States, this situation is quite common. As technology becomes readily available to more and more people, some schools offer the option for students to learn without being at school by way of the Internet. Those who oppose online school argue that technology is harmful to learning and that the best learning environment is the classroom. While it is ideal that the student be in the classroom, sometimes technology is helpful when the student cannot physically attend class 
5352	It is imperative that people abandon their old fashioned ideas about technology and school and recognize the benefits that online school may provide. Distance learning and online school would benefit students and schools 
5353	Distance learning is a viable option for students so that when school is cancelled, the missed day is not a complete waste, especially in regions that are succeptable to severe weather. 
5354	Teachers usually set lesson plans and assessment dates far in advance, but when weather interferes, their entire schedule is thrown off and their plans have to be pushed back. When school is canceled for more than a few days, holidays become regular school days, and sometimes students have to attend extra days in the summer to make up for the lost seat time. Furthermore, sometimes driving buses after a severe weather event can be hazardous due to debris or ice lingering on roadways, even once school is back in session. Online school eliminates these issues with school wide cancellations because the student can simply attend classes at home no matter the weather. 
5355	Online school may benefit students that have conditions preventing them from coming to school. For instance, a student may have health conditions 
5356	that keep them at home or even in the hospital, and that includes mental health conditions as well. Some students may have a disease or disorder so debilitating that they cannot get out of bed some mornings. These afflictions may be long-term and may keep them bedridden or even in the hospital. 
5357	Many childrens' hospitals have school-like systems already in place and communications with a patient's school so that no one falls behind in their studies while they receive treatment, 
5358	Additionally, students that come from less fortunate backgrounds may have duties at home to perform, like caring for family members or working to make money for the family 
5359	Some schools recognize the responsibilities a student may have at home and supply them their papers and materials, 
5360	but then again, very few offer that type of compassion. 
5361	While the student receives the school materials they need, they do not get to participate in discussion or attend lectures that help to solidify the information. But with distance learning, the student is able to participate in class online while they cannot be physically present. 
5362	It is proven that students show the most success when they are present in the classroom, but that success is not limited to being physically present. Technology is the solution to wasteful missed school days caused by severe weather, health, and home conditions. Students can get around the things that hinder them from achieving success in school by attending classes online. Of course, the goal of every institution is to make sure that their students receive the information they need for their future so they thrive, so it is absurd that anyone would put down the idea of online school. In fact, technology connects people to one another. The world is constantly growing and changing in terms of technology, so why should our schools be any different?  
5363	In the American Public School system, education is primarily compromised of students physically attending their school and learning from teachers in person. However, with the rise of technology and the internet in the 21st century, students at most public schools are able to participate in learning both online and via video conferences, allowing them to effectively be educated from home. Distance learning in this way permits students to work on school subjects, even when away due being ill in some manner, and allows students with mental health disorders unable to attend classes the opportunity to achieve the same as someone attending school physically. Additionally, students working a job outside of school to support their family/self now have the opportunity to attend school from home/work and still be able to provide financial support to dependents/themselves. 
5364	due to sickness 
5365	careers clashing with school scheduling. 
5366	The first and likely most prominent way in which students benefit from distance learning is the case in which they miss school for an extended period of time due to illness. 
5367	Distance learning allows these absent students to still work on school subjects and stay on top of their work, while also reducing the risk of other students receiving the same illness due to the student continuing to attend school. Students attending school while still sick is a prominent issue in public schooling, caused by the lack of support for students unable to attend school. This issue would be eliminated due to the reduced need for sick students to continue attending school due to distance learning allowing students to stay at home while continuing to work on school subjects.  
5368	Speaking from personal experience with family members and friends with mental disorders, public schools can often be a breeding ground for self doubt, anxiety, and general depression to occur for mentally unstable people, regardless of counseling opportunities available. Working on school subjects would allow for mentally unstable students to pursue their education, while also allowing them to maintain a healthy mindset in the comfort of their own home away from mentally unhealthy stimuli. 
5369	A final example of the benefits of distance schooling for public school students would be the opportunity for students working job/s outside of school to simultaneously pursue an education and support themselves or their dependents. 
5370	Many lower class students or students with parents unable to work feel the need to obtain jobs outside of school, ranging from part-time summer jobs to full-time year-round jobs that inhibit the ability to pursue an education. Distance learning allows these students to do both at the same time if they have the desire to do so, instead of having to go to a program such as night school in order to catch up on work they usually do not have time to do. Distance learning essentially unlocks the ability for students working outside of school to continue to pursue academics while also maintaining financial balance for themselves or others. 
5371	To sum up, the opportunities for students with work hours interfering with school, mental health disorders or various illnesses are all benefits for the usage of distance learning within the American school system. Although some find distance learning to only further complicate the process of education for students due to some not having reliable access to WiFi or internet, different accommodations are usually available locally for students to use distance learning as a tool to further their education. Distance learning serves as a universal golden opportunity for students unable to attend school to continue to receive and education regardless of outside circumstances. 
5372	Some may argue that the people's votes don't necessarily influence the outcome of the election since electors can still change for whom they vote for, so they request that the popular vote  determine who becomes president. 
5373	This idea implies that all eligible citizens in the U.S.  to vote in the election when truth being over half of the nationwide population does not cast a vote, with the leading cause being apathy. Also it is implied that all citizens are informed about who they  vote for. 
5374	The electoral college was established to help the election proces run smoothly and it has worked for decades without any major flukes or flaws. So why change now? 
5375	"Back then, presidents wouldn't accept the Electoral College. ""What have Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO all, in their time, agreed on? Answer: Abolishing the electoral college!"" "
5376	"""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters."" It's because of the winner-take-all system that happens also on each state. "
5377	with all do respect I want to tell you why you shouldn't require all students to perform community service. 
5378	First of all I think its not necessary because some people are doing it already ,and the ones that are not they have a reason not to be doing it! 
5379	I know it is something important for everybody to do ,but it is also important for you to understand that some people just don't have the time or just don't want to do it. 
5380	I have some friends that are too busy to be doing community service because they have jobs or are taking care of siblings. Please do not require us to do it there are many people that don't want to . 
5381	They are the kids who really don't want to do it ,and that means more meetings with you .Now I know you really don't want to deal with that ,so why bother do the requirement . 
5382	Some things we could do are cleaning up liter and making our Earth healthier. 
5383	Another thing is our community can make a garden and plant vegetables, trees, flowers and other things 
5384	Our community can also donate to homeless families and families that live in shelters and that would need things for their family or themselves. 
5385	We can give them things like, clothes, toys, food, make up, blankets/sheets and other things a person would need. Everyone needs someone to take care of them and look out for them and they always will need someone there. 
5386	I feel most should do community service and that it is better for the earth 
5387	It helps stop waste and pollution. It is safer for the world and its people. Without pollution the world and humans can go on living healthy lives and lifestyles. Not taking care of the world is not taking care of ourselves. The world could end as we know it because of pollution. It isn't safe. 
5388	Also, community service teaches valuable skills and lessons that one may need later on in life. 
5389	It teaches how to clean up after yourself and after others, how NOT to litter, and respect towards others. If we do not learn this earlier in life we won't have the knowledge and care to do it later in life. Teaching this lesson about community service to children could cause a chain reaction. They could teach their friends the lesson, and they could even teach their children in the future. 
5390	Another reason community service is important is because it gets children out of the house and doing something active. 
5391	Most students spend their time playing video games, or on the computer, or even watching television, and soon enough, it will become daily activities possibly for the rest of their lives. Kids can break away from the electronics and be outside getting fresh air in their systems. They could even meet new friends. 
5392	I think community service is a great idea, but not all may agree. Although it may stop pollution, teach life lessons, and break them away from brainwashing electronics, they should be able to make their own choices. Therefore, i feel doing community service should be optional. 
5393	Presidential elections provides the United States of America with an opprotunity of unification. The process of choosing the next leader of the United States always brings the people of the country together knowing that all of them play a role in the election. This is present in the popular vote, a vote consisting of the general population. However, the popular vote is not always accurate, as anyone of any background can vote as long as they hold proper citzenship. The electoral college on the other hand, is a process that serves as a compromise between Congress and the rest of America. 
5394	because it unifies Congress and the people of America 
5395	is part of the country's roots.  
5396	To begin with, the electoral college, more than anything, unifies the people. The electors were once, as everyone in the nation is, an average citizen. 
5397	"The general population, though average citizens, are somtimes not as qualified as Congress to make unbiased, beneficial decisions on behalf of the rest of the country. However, knowing that the next President could be a part of Congress, sometimes sways the decision in favor of a particular candidate. In this paradox of the qualification of Congress and the average citizen, the electoral college is used to fill the void. The electoral college has been used since the founding of the country. The founding fathers of America (George Washington, Ben Franklin, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, etc.)must have developed the electoral college process for some reason. According to the Office of the Federal Register, ""The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" More than anything the electoral college is a mutual and nuetral process that represents something inbetween the biased politics of Congress and the average citizen. The average working class person is the greatest example of American integrity. This person shows that in this great nation, if you set a goal and are willing to work to acheive that goal, it can be acheived. "
5398	While there have been a few flaws in the electoral college throughout history, this decision making process still unifies the people of America and is still, most importantly, part of its roots. More than anything, the electoral college process represents the two sides of the country: Congress and the average working class citizen. So, rest easy knowing that the next election, there is a process between Congress and average working citizens that works to make the decision that is best for the people of this great nation, the United States of America. 
5399	In my opinion i think that all students shouldn't have to participate in community service 
5400	because some kids have important things that they have to do, not want to do, have to do 
5401	For example what if a student had siblings that were younger than they were and couldn't take care of themselves, so their older siblings would have to take care of them. Then the student couldn't take care of their community service hours. Another is what if a student participated in sports and had an important game to go to. That means that they couldn't finish their hours as well. Another example is what if students had a big test to study for and it was worth half of their grade, then they would have to study instead of community service. That also means that another student could not fulfil their community service hours. 
5402	It's not just three or six students that could not fulfil their hours. The whole class would have to study for the test and more that six students have younger siblings that they have to take care of and finally, more that six students participate in sports or other extra curricular activities which means that all of those students could not perform their given community service hours. Since they could not perform their given hours then they would have to face the consequences even though it wasn't the students faults. They had more important things they had to do, not want to do, had to do. 
5403	In today's world, technology is everywhere. Technology helps assist in everyday tasks and brings about new levels of creativity. In this new age of innovation, smart cars fit right in with all other aspects of our digitalized lives. Not only could driverless cars help in many other ways regular cars can't, but they also allow for an increase in safety potential. 
5404	Overall, driverless cars will be beneficial for the modern world. 
5405	The use of driverless cars can vary from ecofriendly transportation to customization for individual scheduals. 
5406	Driverless cars would also help communities everywhere with safety. 
5407	Since these smart cars are loaded with sensor technology, they can help limit the amount of crashes that were regularly happening. The protypes of driverless cars have gone millions of miles without crashes and could help stunt the commonality of vehicular crashes and deaths. Driverless cars could also aide with the safety for learning and elderly drivers. Oftentimes, teenage drivers and drivers with slow reaction times are the causes of accidents that could have been avoided with easy assistance. Smart, semi-driverless cars could be the answer to these costly problems. 
5408	Ultimately, driverless cars would have an extreme influence on today's society. The assistance from technology has changed the world we live in and will continue to do so. Driverless cars are the step in the right direction for driving innovations all across the world. 
5409	I think we should end the Electoral college because it is not fair to each american. 
5410	It's not fair because voters can't control who they pick, and the person they vote for end up losing the presidential election 
5411	You should definitely take action and have SCHOOL_NAME students do community service work, at least a few hours a week, so SCHOOL_NAME, and SCHOOL_NAME can become a much better community. 
5412	"Some excuses might be, "" I have too much homework to do after school"", or "" I already participate in many after school activities, isn't that enough""? "
5413	The idea of a Electoral College adds a sense of competition persuading a candidate to influence states with a high number of electoral votes making the race for interesting. 
5414	I do not think that every student should be forced to do community service. 
5415	All community service is voluntary work, if its not voluntary, then it is just work 
5416	People who do community service enjoy and want to help the community, if they are forced to do community service, they would not perform to the best of their abilities and waste their time. This would not be best for the schools and the community.  
5417	The concept of community service is that you go do your work that you got and you do it for free because you wanted to and you feel good about yourself. 
5418	The Electoral College, established by the Founding Fathers within the Constitution, was meant to serve as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and a popular vote of citizens. What the founding fathers failed to see was the many outstanding flaws within the Electoral College. For many imperative reasons that cannot be avoided, 
5419	elections must be changed to the method of popular vote, and the Electoral College must not be a part of the United States' elections any longer.  
5420	The first and foremost reason why the Electoral College should no longer be kept in the U.S is because it will only lead to negative consequences. This has been observed in the past, and it must be prevented from occuring once more. One element of this disaster factor is that electors could defy the will of the people. 
5421	"Source 2 informs readers that state legislators are are technically responsible for picking electors. These electors could very easily decide to vote upon who they would like to see in office, rather than who the citizens want. The impact of this would be trecharous when the wrong person is elected as president. Source two quotes, ""Back in 1960, segregationsists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the democratic electors with new electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy."" This means that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy. How is that for a compromise between Congress and U.S voters? "
5422	"Furthermore, another way in which keeping the Electoral College would be disastorous would be seen in the case of a state sending two states of electors. Bradford Plumer reminded those in favor of the Electoral College that this has happened in Hawaii in 1960. Luckily, enormous downfall was avoided because Vice President Richard Nixon, presider over the Senate, validated his opponent's electors and did so ""without establishing a precedent."" However, America may not be so lucky the next time this may take place. Senators in each and every state must open their eyes and really see what is happening in their country. The U.S must change its elections to the popular vote system, where all of these impacts will be avoided. The Electoral College does nothing for its citizens, and states may send two states of electors to it, and for these reasons, America will face a very unhappy situation if we keep this system. "
5423	Popular vote is a much better system than the Electoral College because unlike the Electoral College, it is actually fair for its citizens. America, which has suffered greatly to acheieve equality and liberty is held back by one thing-- the Electoral College. This is suffered by the United States' citizens because of the College's winner-take-all system. 
5424	"Through this, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. Source 2 refers back to the 2000 campaign, saying, ""...seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all...and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" How can a president be properly elected with this system in place? "
5425	"Source 3 attempts to discredit this claim, aguing, ""Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign..."" "
5426	In addition, as far as being unfair goes, there are also unpredicatable scenerios that may occur in elections. These scenerios are far from fair to anybody. For instance, there is always the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. If that were to happen, the election would be thrown into the House of Representatives where voting would be handed over to state delegations. 
5427	"Plumer quotes, ""Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the House's selection can hardly be expected to...unfair."" This would not happen if the U.S adopts the popular vote method, where the most popular candidate will win and reflect the citizens who placed him or her into office. The Electoral College is nothing other than unfair to the citizens who rely on it to elect their president. "
5428	For many reasons, election methods must be changed to popular vote, and the Electoral College must be disgarded. It will only lead to a profound disaster, and it is also extremely biased and unfair. The United States must take action, one state at a time, to reverse the negative path it is on. This is the only way the U.S can finally reach its long term goal-- complete prosperity.    
5429	I personally do not think that community service should be required by all students. 
5430	Yes, community service is beneficial to the community, but students need to focus on one thing, and one thing only. School. 
5431	I believe that community service can be an extracurricular activity outside of school, if anything.  
5432	You see, I know how it's like to be a student, as do you, and I think we can both agree on how hectic situations can get throughout the year. Homework becomes burdensome at times, schoolwork becomes tedious. Your life is bifurcated between school and outside of school, leaving almost no room for anything else.  
5433	If you were to make community service mandatory at school, how do you think that will unravel? For all you know, petitions could be made by my fellow classmates. I'm sure some of my peers agree with my point of view regarding this topic. 
5434	Dear state senator, I think that we should change to start voting by popular vote 
5435	it will be easier for the voters 
5436	is a more realistic way of voting.  
5437	When voting and following the rules of the electoral college, many voters get confused. 
5438	"As is says in source 2, many voters vote for the wrong person. They also don't always get controll over who they vote for. Say they voted for one canidate to be their state senator, well with that one person comes many people that have ""pledged"" themselves to that canidate. They would be voting for the canidate and these many people that have pledged themselves to him and they don't even know it.  Also as they say in source 2, the election of 2000 was a huge mishap in presidential election history. In states like Louisiana, they had people replace democratic electors so that the popular vote that would've went to one of the canidates, didn't actually go through. "
5439	Although the electoral college is good for getting exact numbers and helps solve disputes( source 3) 
5440	it is an uruly and untrustworthy way of voting and should not be used anymore. Voters are easily confused when voting and many do not follow up on what is happening during election time. 
5441	I think that a better way to votee would be to vote more often and give the electors another chance to be relected so that after a few months if voters changed their mind then they could reelect someone else. 
5442	Popular vote is a much better idea not only becuase it is more realistic, but because it is easier to understand. Even some of our presidents like Richard Nixon and Bob Dole have thought that this was the way to go. Not only do they believe this, but they lost their presidency votes becuase of the electoral college. I think that they are just trying to scam voters and pick someone that would be best for them, not for our country. I think that by using the electoral college method, they are cheating into picking the winners, but if we used popular vote, this wouldnt happen. 
5443	"A Certainty of outcome. It is stated in Source 3 that it is less likely to have a dispute of electoral votes than popular votes. And it's because of the winning candidate's share of popular votes. Everyone's President. It's stated that the Electoral College requires to a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. The South and Northeast region don't have enough electoral votes to elect a president. So Romney had no incentive of campaining in the South. Swing states. The winner-take-all method is popular in each state in the U.S. Giving the winning candidate to win the presidency. The ""toss-up"" states are more likely to pay more attention to the campaign. 4 Big states. Larger states are more likey to have more electoral votes than smaller states. In contrast, Florida and Wyoming. Florida has 29 and Wyoming with only a mere 3 electoral votes. Avoid run-off elections. The electoral college avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. "
5444	"Walking into the voting booth ""...every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November"" (Office Of Federal Register 6), the people of the United States of America expect their vote to count. Although, the president is elected in a more indirect way, by the electoral college, which does not represent the people, and is not fair "
5445	The president should be elected by popular vote from now on.  
5446	The first problem that the electoral college faces is the fact that it does not truly represent the opinion of the people. 
5447	"First, voters can walk into the booth and ""...get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate"" (Plumer 10). Not every voter is educated on exactly how the electors and candidates are represented on the ballot and that may lead to an accidental win. On top of this misconception, almost decietfully, an elector promised to a candidate can change their vote at a moments notice(Plumer 10). Even Posner who writes for the electoral college admitted that it is possible, and he claims that it is ""rare"";however, it has happened before in 1960 (Plumer 11), and not even Posner can control the actions of an elector, legally anyway. Also, when a candidate wins a popular vote, which is the true mind of the people, that candidate still may not win the electoral vote, overall, loosing the election. This happened just a few years back in the 2000 election between President Bush and Gore(Posner 16).All in all, the electoral college does not represnt the people. "
5448	Looking deeper into the subject, elections by the electoral college are not fair. 
5449	"The first example appears in the method of the ""...""winner-take-all"" system that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate""(Office of Federal Register 7). Because of this system, Presidential candidates may not feel the need to campaign to all people, just those of the states with the highest amount of electoral votes(Plumer 13). This goes against the american concept of ""all men are created equal"", leaving voters feeling undervauled and not important. Second, ""A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes-538- is an even number.."" (Posner 18). Although this tie is claimed to be ""highly unlikely"". However, an election by popular vote would make the conundrum even further unlikely by the general logic of the fact that it is a lot less possible for the opinion of an entire nation to be split down the middle than that of 538 electors. "
5450	Another issue with a tie in the electoral college lies in how that draw is resolved. 
5451	"The  tie-breaker is left to the representatives in congress, and ""Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming...would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California..."" (Plumer 12). This simply does not give all the voters equal say in who wins the election. All of these topics and more compressed together represent how un fair the election truly is.  "
5452	Inflexibility is one of the most common sources of failure for most people in large organizations. Public schools happen to be classified as large organizations, so the statistic mentioned previously obviously applies. Many students have a difficult time at a physical school, whether it be from medical problems, social anxiety, or even if they are just away on personal leave. Advancements in technology have helped to solve these difficulties at school, such as: easily-accessible internet, affordable personal computers, and large-scale organization software like Microsoft's Office 365. These advancements make up a new kind of education: virtual schooling 
5453	Virtual schooling allows students to access the same education as physical students while being away from the actual school. Schools should utilize this new type of schooling 
5454	for students who cannot attend school due to medical problems 
5455	students who are stressed by a public environment 
5456	students who are away from school due to a large-scale world events. 
5457	Medical issues can frequently cause students to miss school and fall behind the other students in terms of their studies. While they are usually acquitted from late penalties, students with many health issues usually have to make up schoolwork on their own time, after the medical treatment has concluded 
5458	With online schooling, students can complete lessons and assignments while recovering from a treatment in the hospital, offsetting the amount of schoolwork that they have to make up for later. 
5459	Without online schooling, recovering students do not really utilize their time in the hospital, usually using cellular devices or other forms of entertainment. However, with online schooling, students can utilize their time efficiently, to save time and effort that would hurt them later. 
5460	Along the lines on medical issues, some students have social or mental disorders that bar them from attending school like a neurotypical student would. 
5461	Disorders like Social Anxiety or Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) can cause some students extreme stress under a social environment. Online school is a remedy for this, as it allows these students to access the same classes, but under a much less stressful environment. These students would also perform better online, as the negative stress that would otherwise affect their grades would be missing; therefore, with online schooling, students with social or mental disorders would perform better in terms of grades and attendance.  
5462	Large-scale world events can also cause students to miss school. 
5463	With these large-scale events, it it usually large groups of students that are affected, with some events causing an entire school system to shut down. For example, in early 2020, there has been a viral pandemic of a certain Coronavirus, with Asia and Europe most affected by it. In Italy, school have been shut down across the country, including schools affiliated with the U.S. Military Overseas School Program. One high school that has been shut down has began to utilize online schooling with video chat features for lecturing. All students at the school utilize the online schooling program, so that their school year is not interrupted by the pandemic. 
5464	As the world becomes more technologically advanced, online schools have become more prominent at a high school and college level. Online school provides education to those who cannot attend a physical school, whether it be from medical issues, social issues, or mental issues. Large-scale closings of school due to world events are also remedied by online schooling, keeping school going while the physical school is shut down temporarily. These benefits outweigh the minimal cost of online schooling. The low cost and high reward of online schooling definitely benefit both the student and the school. 
5465	"So if you live in a state like Texas for example, your votes goes to 34 Democratic electors that you don't know and this can create confusion about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate. The best argument about the electoral college is the disaster factor. It happen once in 1960 where ""Louisianna legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who oppose John F. kennedy,"" Which means that those popular votes for Keenedy would not actually gone to him. Bob Dole says the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. "
5466	When Mars Orbiter Camera team snap pictures it was ten time sharper than the original Viking photos¨. This means that when Viking snap the picture it was not as clear as this one. Then, when it is not clear you assume something by the way it shape like in this situation. 
5467	Imagine walking into a classroom where as soon as the teacher turns to the white board the students pull out phones and other devices and begin using them. Because they are allowed to have phones during free times they can't get into as much trouble for having such things on. Have you ever tried talking to someone who is texting and they don't even respond?  Despite many pleas about how it would cut down on texts during class, 
5468	I believe the no phones at all during school to make much more sense. 
5469	The no phones condition would make the school not responsible for any stolen phones 
5470	stop almost all texting during class  
5471	and make test scores higher. 
5472	 In our school I have sometimes seen problems where kids will steal each others stuff including phones, if the teachers or kids don't know who stole it or can't get it back the I can see many an angered parent suing the district or the school.  I know for a fact that I have once suffered as I thought someone had stolen my phone and I wouldn't get it back, I knew that if I would tell a teacher the whole class would be punished until someone came forward and even then my parents would be mad unless that person would get suspended or expelled. 
5473	I know that in the district handbook said it wouldn't be responsible for any lost items but if you allow kids to bring electronics to school you are making yourself responsible.  
5474	This would also cut down on texting during class as if children are caught with a phone even in their pocket they would be in trouble. 
5475	Once before in Spanish class I was caught texting but it was only because the phone was in my hand that my teacher could prove it, had I slipped the phone into my backpack as I saw her coming she would have no reason to think that I had been texting in her class beside vague suspicion. Another thing it would do is if a teacher heard a phone ring in class they used to go easy on people because their only fault might have been forgetting to turn it off. With this new policy in place kids could be punished just for having it there not just on. 
5476	Another good thing no phones would do would to make test scores higher. 
5477	Without as much distraction caused by drama such as how 'PROPER_NAME and PROPER_NAME are dating' or 'how cute is so-and-so' they would be able to focus more in class, learn more and test better. The other thing is kids wouldn't have it as easy if they wanted to cheat on tests and therefore make their tests invalid. For any school that strives to make itself better a 'No Phone' policy would help them a lot. 
5478	"Another argument, according to source 3, paragraph 23, is that the Electoral College method of choosing the president, ""may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state. "
5479	The Electoral College, all-in-all, has helped us a lot, yes, but it is high time we go back to the popularity vote. It would make most citizens, and many potential voters, happier to know that they are accounted for, and we won't have the potential of the popularity winner, the one the people actually voted for, to lose on account of the electors. It should be the people of America's decision, not a group of government workers, to decide who runs our nation 
5480	e could have other options on having a better vote system that is more accurate and fair to the the people/voters.  
5481	 Secondly, this is not the greatest way to vote because first the voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, which in turn elect the president 
5482	Third, according to the Al Gore-thanks to the quirks of the electoral college- won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of the voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now 
5483	What is the electoral college?  The electoral college is a process which consists of the selection of the electors, meeting where they vote for president, and the counting of the votes.  The real question is, is the electoral college helping us or is it just bringing our government farther towards disaster? 
5484	The electoral college should be diminished 
5485	it is an unfair direct election 
5486	the disaster factor.  
5487	To begin, by keeping the electoral college we could avoid run off elections.  This would help our governmental system 
5488	"because as noted by Richard A. Posner, ""There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast.""  By keeping the electoral college, we could help resolve run-off elections. "
5489	What we dont know is if it will permanantly work for our governmental system and is it worth the risk 
5490	Although that is true, that is only one problem that would be resolved by the electoral college, and olne benefit is outnumbered by the numerous disadvantages to the electoral college. 
5491	Moreover, the disaster facor has a huge impact on the electoral collage. 
5492	"The writer states, ""The American people should consider themselves lucky that the 2000 fiasco was the biggest election crisis in a century; the system allows for much worse"" (Plumer).  This disaster was not the first disaster to happen in the system.  According to Plumer, the system has had much more effect and damage on the United States and this should not be repeated again.  The writer also says, ""electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please"" (Plumer).  This goes to show, not only is the electoral college unbeneficial, but they can be sneaky.  The electoral college should be abolished because of the atrocious outcomes it is capable of doing to our government. "
5493	Not only is the electoral college capable of the disaster factor, but it also has no direct election.  
5494	"As stated in ""What Is the Electoral College?"", ""... when you vote for your candidate you are acually voting for your candidate's electors."" (Office of the Federal Register).  This means, voters have no control over whom controls the country.  That is outrageous that the lives of these people will be affected by someone they did not want in the overpowering decisions of their country. Writer Plumer states, ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair too voters"" as well as ""The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational"" (Plumer).  Both of these point go to show that the electoral college is lowering our hopes for the government.  The writer also notes, ""candidates don't spend time in states they have no chance in winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states"" (Plumer).  This proves that the electoral government thinks about their winning chances instead of our countries government.  Are we going to sit here and let them take advantage of their power that will lead us towards disaster? "
5495	All in all, the electoral collage should be banished from the government.  Who wants our government to get weaker and more unfair to the citizens?  By taking away the electoral college our government would gain back its strength and become the hard- working government we know it can be!    
5496	Most people who reach the age of 16 are elated to be able to learn how to drive. When they reach that point in their lives, they feel independent, responsible. They would not like to have that priviledge taken away from them. In fact, though most teens start to question authority more around the age of 16, they would do anything to stay out of trouble and would never risk the chance of having their driving priviledge revoked. Driverless cars would eliminate the entire experience of learning how to drive and all the pleasure one feels from it. 
5497	Driverless cars are an brilliant idea and would reduce the number of casualties and deaths that are caused by car accidents every year.  They would also, however, bring up new problems that would need to be solved. 
5498	Not everyone would be able to afford a driverless car, 
5499	If there were to be a mix of car types on the road, there would be the issue of accidents caused by cars with drivers. 
5500	Another issue that would arise would be NASCAR. 
5501	Driverless cars would eliminate some jobs, but also create some others. 
5502	Driverless cars would both solve and cause problems in the future, should they become the norm. If not everyone could afford the new, expensive cars, who would be blamed for the car accidents that are bound to happen? Sports that include car racing, such as NASCAR, would be eliminated and thousands of people would be left without jobs and, potentially, on the streets. Though the new cars would create new jobs as well, they would also cause new thefts by employees in companies to better the flow of there income. Driverless cars would cause more problems than they would be worth in the long run. 
5503	one way is that they can put on headphones to relax and work hard and listen to some music. Some teachers hate when students have their phone out or when they are listening to music so begin at home may cause the student to focus more by listening to music because every student has a different way of studying and one student might be more focus if he or she loves listening to music when working or studying. This also makes the student more relived that he or she can listen to music. Students who are always trying to bust a joke or make a noise causes problems for a student who is trying to work to get her grade up this makes it very hard for a student to focus on what their are supposed to do. Students can benefit from listening to music because for me when I listen to music while I am working I feel great and energetic making it easy for me to knockout my work at a fast rate. 
5504	Some students can't catch the bus because the bus is too far away from their house this makes going to school very difficult because without a reliable ride to school everyday you may be coming to school very late making it hard for you to study or work on assignments because you are worried about how you will get home because you do not have a reliable ride to school to home. This makes a student stress a lot thats why working at home you would not be worried about who would be taking to and back from school. It also makes the student more productive because they would not have to find a ride all the time they could study and get their work done faster than other people. Also coming to school late makes it very hard to understand what was taught in the classroom making a student very stressed over it because a student grade might go down because he or she failed the test cause they came late to school so that student might not have understood what was taught. 
5505	sometimes teachers may go through the assignment very quickly making it hard for a student to understand the what he or she or supposed to do. Also teachers may not give as much time for students to finish assignment working at home makes it easier because you have as much time as needed for you to complete your assignment and also for a student to revise over their work before turning it in to the teacher students may not be able to turn in assignments on time depending on the assignment this makes a student very stressful because they do not want to turn in the assignment late and get a late grade for it. Sometimes students worry about things like this especially when a student grade is flunking and they need to get it up to graduate or move on to the next grade level.  
5506	if you could a student could work from home that would change the way a student studies and complete assignment because they have time on their hands and also the are relaxed they would not have to sit in a class for over 55 minutes. Working at home could be very beneficial because It could be very difficult for another student to learn at school because they might be that one student who is making it hard for a student trying to focus or a student might be stressed because they might not have a ride to and back from school and worried that they might not enough time to finish their assignment and get it turned in on time. Working at home may not stress a student because they would have enough time to complete an assignment. This is why working on assignments at home would benefit a student.          
5507	Some clubs or sports have a positive influence on students, such as meting new people. I was on the cross country team for three years in a row. I met some good friends there. If community service was mandatory then this would not exist and students would miss very valuable opportunities. Another example is that sometimes, clubs help the school. At my school we have the helping hands club. You can tell by the name that this club helps the school. This club would have no time after school and our school would not be the place it is today. 
5508	Community service should be a choice, not mandatory. Sometimes students serve the community with the little things they do every day, like RELATIVE_NAME's challenge says. Clubs and organisations are important to a student too and with community service around there would be no time. Some students might not even do the service at all. And it takes too long which may result in sleep loss. I hope you take my views into consideration. 
5509	Electoral College is a process that help the United States over many many years. So my question now is, why are you trying to get rid of it? They made so it a vote from Congress would go towards the President and a popular vote from cictizens. Without the Electroal College barely anyone's vote would be heard and Congess would be making our choice for us 
5510	By popular vote, we should change the election process to The People voting directly. 
5511	"According to my knowledge, the Electoral College isn't fair to voters. I know that many people such as, Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFC-CIO agree with me on this. For instance, in the second passage on the first paragraph, it says that and much more. ""They're not alone [Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter...]; according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore - thanks to the quirks of the Electoral College - won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" Suggesting by what this satement says, a lot of people disagree with our system of election "
5512	We should be able to vote directly ourselves and not have electors do it for us. How do we know we can trust them? Yes, they're a part of our government, but that doesn't mean a thing. 
5513	"The Electoral College was originally founded to be exactly what it is today; a vote that is held in Congress that is made by popular vote by citizens. But it has changed more than you think.  In article one in the 6th paragraph, it tells exactly how the Electoral College is run. ""The presidential election is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in Novemeber. You help choose your state's electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors."" This paragraph is saying that the person you vote for is basically supposed to be voted for by his electors. In the second  article, what the author is saying is that even though this certain person will get popular vote, they won't agree with it and they'll go against the votors decisions. This isn't the right thing, obviously. I'm sure that no one knows for a fact that's true though. Even though, this is still a messed up way to vote. "
5514	This country is about freedom and the right to do what we'd like, as long as it's rational. This is not rational. We need to be able to vote independentley. 
5515	There are many things wrong with this aspect of our government. Even though people don't think much of it, we're being treated unfairly. 
5516	"In the second article, in paragraph 2, Plumer (the author) makes a very good point. ""Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party's central committee, sometimes the presidential candidates themselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes."" This makes us realize that we don't know who, for a fact, the electors are. It also shows that we don't know who the electors will vote for. Usually, they would probably vote for the person that were made to vote for.  "
5517	None of us know what goes on in the Electoral College. We don't know if they vote for who we tell them to vote for. We don't know if they practically cheat us from getting the president we want. 
5518	"In article one, paragraph 8, there is something that the governor does that maybe is supposed to reassure us. ""After the presidential election, your governor prepares a ""Cerificate of Ascertainment"" listing all of the candidates who ran for President in your state along with the names of their respective electors.""  This is just them saying who was all voted for and who all ran. It also says who the electors were. They give us this probably just to notify us but maybe it's also an idea to make us think that Electoral College is proud to help us get who we want. "
5519	They are incapable of responding to accidents that happen to other vehicles, let alone reacting to an accident or a possible accident to themselves. 
5520	They can have navigation errors or may react to what could be seen as an oncoming car, but it might just be some animal or a harmless object. 
5521	Even in movies, the driverless cars end up having problems or malfunctioning quite a bit. 
5522	even with all the technology put into them, the cars still are not actually driverless.  
5523	Even if driverless cars are mass-produced, they will still have to move alongside many people with normal cars. 
5524	"Driverless cars will be of little entertainment interest to people. Drivers would ""get bored waiting for their turn to drive,"" (Driverless Cars Are Coming). "
5525	Due to all the money put into the driverless cars, they are going to be very expensive and out of the ordinary worker's price range. 
5526	"With all the technology put into the discovery and creation of driverless cars, there is a going to be an extremely high cost. Sometimes the technologies required to make these vehicles are ""simply too expensive to be practical,"" (Driverless Cars Are Coming). Very few people would be able to afford these cars, so there would be little buyers for the companies. They are using devices that at one point in time ""cost two hundred million dollars,"" (Driverless Cars Are Coming). Companies would end up losing more money than they would gain if they invested in driverless cars. "
5527	Although many arguments cannot be proven until they are out and on the road in regularity, driverless cars should not be created for normal use. They can cause many problems on the road. They are unsafe and unentertaining to the occupants. They may have navigation issues when faced with and accident or a work zone or some form of traffic diversion. If driverless cars are produced, they may not stay popular for any long period of time. 
5528	I believe all students must do tasks to assist the community. Students should participate in helping the community 
5529	it helps our community and city possibly even our state look good 
5530	it will make the children performing the tasks more responsible. 
5531	Most kids helping with the community will feel good about themselves 
5532	they will think to themselves wow i really did help make a difference in my community. They will often take pride in their work. We should help our communities. 
5533	The children of OTHER_NAME should help clean our streets, help the needy, raise money for the city parks or even tutor the children in OTHER_NAME elementary schools. By doing this, the tourists will begin to say good things about the city of OTHER_NAME and the city of OTHER_NAME. We will receive more tourists and people interested in moving to OTHER_NAME or OTHER_NAME. 
5534	We could even assist the needy, if we assist the needy we will look like a community that cares about our residents. When we help the younger we are helping our future lawyers and doctors even our future engineers with their education. 
5535	we will feel depended on and we will most likely feel thankful. We will feel good about ourselves and we will want to participate in more activities to help our community. 
5536	i hope you have come to an conclusion that you should encourage students to participate in community service, not only for the good of the people but for the good of the hearts of the children. 
5537	Community service is a way to distinguish selfish people from selfless people. Some people do large amounts of community service such as working at a soup kitchen and donating food to a food bank. Some even take it to the next level by going and helping out in places like Africa. Unfortunately not all people are open to helping people. 
5538	It is a very moving experience when you give food to someone who is hungry. It teaches you to be appreciative of what you have after you see someone who has nothing. It also makes you feel good inside. Having community service might change the attitude of some kids at your school. 
5539	Many students in the world are placed with the issue of whether or not it would be beneficial to actually attend school in a brick and mortar setting. Some find it beneficial, allowing the students to have a taste of freedom an independence in their work environment, while others think of it as an excuse to stay home and slack off. Pushing that agenda forward, many schools offer students the opportunity to take some of their classes off campus at a different location such as a community college campus or even in the comforts of their own homes. With that being said, more students are choosing to take their classes at different locations instead of the traditional setting. 
5540	Students can benefit from taking classes away from the traditional settings of a school 
5541	by letting them get a taste of their own educational freedo 
5542	by lowering their stress levels while letting them become more comfortable in their own work environment. 
5543	Students can benefit from taking classes away from the traditional setting by giving them a taste of what their own educational freedom is like 
5544	Many college students around the world use online schooling in comparison to physical schooling on a campus. In the United States alone, many college students choose to use online schooling for a number of reasons. Online schooling may be used by them to help balance their lives, choosing to be able to do their work at their own time, compared to being in a building or university, where the deadlines are strict and there is possibly a hard time balancing their lives and school if they have a family. Having that type of educational freedom is very important in that sense, as to help students, no matter how old they are, achieve their educational goals in less of a strict environment.  
5545	Students can benefit from taking classes away from the traditional setting by helping lower their stress levels and being more comfortable in their own work environment.  
5546	Many students face the intense pressures of being in a brick and mortar school environment and often can't handle it, becoming very uncomfortable where they are and losing sight of themselves in the stress. By pulling those students out of the environment that hinders their ability to learn and retain information properly due to their stress and lack of comfort, and placing them into an environment where they can prosper, retain and possibly learn faster can truly help students become better and more confident in themselves and the work they put out to the world. When students are constantly stressed out in their school setting, it makes it harder for them to excel in their studies, even when it isn't a subject that is particularly hard for them, so allowing them the extra educational freedom of choosing how they want to take their classes, whether it be completely at home on the computer, completely physical in a brick and mortar buliding, or some mixture of the two, students can combat their educational stress. 
5547	Not all students face the problem of being stressed in the school setting, some quite like how the curriculum can be set and like the challenges of strict due dates and lectures. More often than not, though, students do find it hard to juggle their schoolwork and their lives. Giving them the option to be able to replace the way they learn and their schooling in general can pave the way for them to become comfortable in their work setting, more dedicated to their work, and overall much happier students than they were before. By grabbing their attention with the benefits of schooling in ways that are seen as less stressful and easier, they can put more effort into their studies and get higher grades, all while getting a taste of all the different ways of schooling in college are like in the world.                                                                                                                                                                  
5548	I believe all students should perform community service 
5549	People that don't help out don't get far in life . Life isn't just about what you want or need . Some people don't get anything they want because they are busy helping others . If people help out the community it would be much cleaner and safe for other children . If there was a park that was dirty and we had some older kids from school help clean it up , it would be a lot safer for those younger children 
5550	You want every child to have a good future and if they learn earlier its much better . Say your child is in the 5th grade and there school is helping clean a beach . Well , later on in life they will be thankful they helped out because everyone wants our beaches nice and clean . 
5551	Some people are to lazy to help out . If we teach children to help out now they won't be lazy in the future 
5552	Some people don't care about their community . That's why people say it takes up to much time because they are being lazy . Helping out the community should be something fun and it doesn't matter how much time it takes up . If its boring to you get a friend to come along with you and help out . The more help the better . 
5553	In the future we don't want our community to be filled with trash and things laying everywhere . We want a nice place to live and grow old . We want a even better future for our children, but if no one helps out then it won't be nice . It will be dirty and unsafe . The more we clean up and help now the better our future will be . That's why I think community service should be required . 
5554	under the electoral college system, voters vote not for president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. a dispute over the outcome of an elecoral college vote is possible, it happend in 200 but, its less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. The reason is that the winning candidate's share of the electoral college invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. The electoral college requires a presidential candidate to have transregional appeal. 
5555	Since the electoral college is so old I think it is time to ebolish it!    
5556	because students sometimes have issues at home were they cant stay after school for activities 
5557	One reason they might not be able to do community service is because they might have a love one that is sick at home and they have to be there for there aid. Second reason is because a student might have financial problems at home were they may have to take on a part time job after school to help around the household with payments. The final reason is that student there self may have health issues forbidding them from doing any community service. Those are the reasons why a student may not be able to do community work after school because of personal issues. 
5558	Also students shouldn't have to perform community service because they might have other activities, clubs, groups or sport related things happening after school. 
5559	One reason is they might be too busy after school everyday to do anything else on the side such as being on a sports team for the town or at school. Second reason is because they might be in a church group that meets everyday to sing or study. The final reason is because a student may just be busy doing regular things like watching a relative after school while their parent or guardian is at work. 
5560	The winner-takes-all is also a big problem. 
5561	Why does electoral college still have its defenders, Abolish the electoral college!... Electoral College was a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. 
5562	I am writing to the state senator of florida to argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College. 
5563	The Electoral College is a way of certainty of outcome. 
5564	Swing states 
5565	Aviod run-off elections. 
5566	The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates. Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign to really listen to the competing candidates knowing that they are going to decide the election. The most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.  
5567	The Electoral College also aviods the problem of election in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 are good examples, they both only a had 43 percent plurality of the popular votes. Some potential voters who have no hope have less in centive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular votes. 
5568	I realize some people may think that community service is a waste of time, a distraction from work or friends and family 
5569	"but I can assure you that community service is greatly needed. It doesn't matter that it may take time away from work or other jobs, we all need to give back now and then. We ,as a community, cant have a ""well-someone-else-should-do-it"" attitude, because if we all thought that then nothing would ever get done "
5570	In these times, when some people are working two jobs just to feed their family, and we have so much extra, it would be selfish and greedy of us not to give back. 
5571	For example, you could go to a animal shelter and help walk and feed the animals. Or you could go to a nursing home and play games with the seniors there. I'm sure they would also love to have someone sit and just listen to them tell a story or two. There are lots of fun ways to help out that don't include getting dirty or being outside. 
5572	They could help clean up garbage at a beach. They could help redo a local park by putting in bark dust or planting trees. Also, they could find a nice local garden or farm that had some jobs that needed to be done. There could be non-profit organizations that need some volunteers with events or charities as well. 
5573	think that if you didn't have the students at our school do community service you would be doing them a great injustice. When we are so privileged to have a nice home, clean water, and a meal on the table every night we should at least be able to go out for an our or two and help someone else who isn't as privileged. Its hardly a great burden to get up from the computer or desk you are at, put on a pair of old jeans and a t-shirt, and go out and help. So I ask only one thing of you; please set aside one day, one measly day, to have all of the students in our school wander out into the community and help someone. 
5574	Though I have not been alive to see most of it, I am sure that the debate on keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote has been going on for ages. Now, the words of a fourteen year old might not mean much to a state senator, especially since it will be four years until I am legally allowed to vote, but please sir, hear me out 
5575	One, if the president was decided by popular vote, our president might not be the best one for the country. 
5576	Secondly, if it were up to a popular vote, the president might win, or not win, simply for being a regional favorite. 
5577	"As stated in the third article, paragraph 20, ""The winner-take-all method of awarding electoral votes induces the candidates... to focus their campaign effors on the toss-up states."" As you know, toss-up state's make the final vote. Therefore, people in these states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign, and they will be the ones with the most information. If it were up to popular vote, then anyone over the age of 18 could randomly pick a winner. Let's be honest, the majority of eighteen year old's will vote on whoever their friends or family vote for, or even the candidate representing their group (Democratic or Republic). Many people, if the president was decided by popular vote, would make an uneducated decision on one of the canidates, not studying their choices as much as one would with the Electoral College system in place. "
5578	"As stated in the third article, paragraph 19, ""...because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president."" Also in the paragraph, it states that no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. If the president was decided by popular vote, however, can you imagine what it would be like? Take Romney, for example. He was a solid regional favorite in the South. Romney knew that there was no incentive to campaign heavily in the South, because he would not gain any electoral votes by increasing his plurilaty in states he knew he would win. If popularity decided the president, residents of the other regions might feel like their vote would not count, and that the president would have no regard for their interests. Say that popularity did actually determine a winner. While most regions might vote for a certain presidents, the ones that did not would feel like that the man running the country wasnt really ""their president"". However, Mr. Senator, if the Electoral College was to stay, this problem would never exist. With the system we have now, the people vote for your state's electors when they vote for the president. Most states also have a ""winner-take-all"" system. Therefore, the canidate with the most votes in a state win's that state's electors. This lets the voting be even, fair. A popular vote would make the voting unfair to those who did not want that president. "
5579	"Now, of course, the other view has to be adressed. As stated in the second article, ""Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning... During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all."" This quote shows that the canidates might not go to a state they know they have no chance in winning. "
5580	I can see how this could support changing to election by popular vote, and how it could be reasonable. If our president was chosen by popular vote, then he would visit all of the states, trying to win them over. However, there are some strong arguments against this. To begin with, one man would have to visit 50 states, and even if he only visited the majority, there is still a posibility that the state will not vote for him anyways, in the end. If we keep the Electoral College, then the majority of votes in a state would count, not his popularity. As a fourteen year old, I can relate this to highschool. A student can be the most popular student in the school, but they can also be the most rude and mean. And while another student may not be popular, they can be the nicest in the school. If the president was chosen by a popular vote, he might just end up being the worst thing that could happen to the country. 
5581	In conclusion, Mr. State Senator, I think that keeping the Electoral College is the best thing for our country. If we changed to election by popular vote, the man (or woman) might not be the best for our country, and the best man might not win because he is not a regional favorite. I hope, sir, that you will take my letter into account when you go to vote on this topic.            
5582	I would first like start by saying that community service is a great thing. without a good community and those who help we have no community. I agree that students should be required to perform community service. 
5583	The whole purpose of democracy is to create a government that reflects the desires, opinions, and attitudes of the people being governed, but how can this be achieved if the people aren't fairly represented during election time, presidential or otherwise? This is the problem with the Electoral College system; it puts all of decision-making power in the hands of our electors, not the citizens themselves. 
5584	To begin with, the electors selected by citizens are capable of defying the will of the people they were chosen to represent. 
5585	Next, in the case of a tie, the opinions of millions of people would be overlooked. 
5586	When it comes to something as serious as the fate of our country, citizens cannot put their faith in the such a corrupt system as the Electoral College. 
5587	"First of all, the Electoral College system creates a window of opportunity for ""faithless"" electors to take advantage of the power given to them by society during the voting process. "
5588	Under the Electoral College, voters do not vote directly for who they want as president, but instead for a slate of electors, who in turn select the president. Although these electors may pledge themselves to a particular candidate, there is no way to determine whether or not they end up casting their vote according to the will of the people who put them in charge. Such an unpredictable turn of events could be avoided if only the outcomes of presidential elections were determined by popular vote, not through an Electoral College. 
5589	Secondly, if a tie were to occur, the opinions of countless citizens would be ignored. 
5590	In this case, the election would be thrown to the House of representatives, were delegates from each state would vote on the president. Since each state has only one vote to cast, a vote from a state containing 500,000 people would carry the same weight as a vote representing the opinions of 35 million. Given that many voters vote one party for president and another for Congress, the selection made by the House of Represenatives can hardly be expected to respesent the will of the people.    
5591	The reason being is because it still needs a driver. 
5592	It watches the driver instead of the road. 
5593	And you have to be alert at all times. 
5594	"This ""driverless car"" should not be called a driverless car. This car still needs a driver. "
5595	This car also watches the driver. 
5596	No, distance learning would not benefit the student 
5597	it would make it harder to make meaningful relationships, 
5598	the courses would change 
5599	it would be easier to become distracted during schoolwork.  
5600	My first reason for why students would not benefit from distance learning is that it would make it harder to make meaningful relationships. 
5601	For example in my own life I have made some of my best friends through the public school system. In third grade I met a kid named Generic_Name and over the years because we went to the same school we became close friends and he even hooked me up with a job last summer. In seventh grade I had a less than desirable English teacher whose monotone voice made him sound like he came straight out of a charlie brown cartoon. Because of him I met a guy named Generic_Name who I quickly befriended because our shared hate toward our English teacher, and now I get a free movie sometimes when Generic_Name is on staff at the Regal movie theater, who I never would have meet if we didnt go to the same school. 
5602	On the other hand there are people that believe it is possible to be connected and make new relationships online, and even though it is possible to do so 
5603	their reasoning is flawed due to the fact that it is always easier to make new relationships through face to face physical contact. 
5604	Someone who exemplifies this fact perfectly is my friend Generic_Name who I met in middle school. In middle school Generic_Name was my best friend, but this changed when she moved and her parents decided to have her take an online schooling program. While she does well in the course she has told me that she misses going to a physical school where she can actually see people because it is harder to make friends due to the nature of the online course and because of the online course whenever I do get to see her she is way more socially awkward than she used to be. All in all distance schooling not only makes it more difficult to make meaningful relationships but because of the lack of those meaningful relationships it makes it even more difficult to learn the intricacies of social interaction.  
5605	Another reason for why students would not benefit from distance learning is that the nature of the courses that we take would change for the worse. 
5606	For example In my ninth grade biology class we had to dissect a frog and organize it's organs. During the assignment I learned more about that frog than I could anywhere else because of the hands on nature of the assignment. This just goes to show that if we started using distance learning courses they would miss out on the hands on portion of learning. 
5607	On the other side of the argument there are those that believe the hands on portion of learning is not very important, and that might apply for some people 
5608	however buy in large the hands on part is extremely important due to the fact that everyone learns differently whether it be auditory, visual, or hands on. 
5609	Someone who demonstrates this fact excellently is my friend Generic_Name. I met Generic_Name sophomore of high school in my chemistry class, and during this class we were given a lot of lab assignments with a paper packet to go with it. During these assignments I would understand most of the work given to us while Generic_Name was a little more lost, and while I tried to help him through the packet he could never fully contemplate the complex design of the stapled pieces of paper, but this all changed once we got to the hands on section. As soon as we got to the hands on portion of whatever lab we were doing it was almost as if he was a completely different person, I would stand back and watch in awe as he took perfect measurements, solving complicated math equations, and just dominating the lab overall. So in the end distance learning would not only take away amazing hands on activities but by doing so would prevent us from learning how we learn whether it be Auditory, Visual, or hands on. 
5610	My last reason for why students would not benefit from distance learning is that it would make it even easier to be distracted from working. 
5611	"For example whenever I am at home doing my math homework and I am getting particularly bored with it it is very easy to ""take a quick break"". This could mean anything from a two minute glass of water or a five hour nap depending on how I am feeling. So if I took a online course I would have to face this same dilemma with every assignment I am given. "
5612	On the other side of the fence there are some people that believe that they are very studious and would never have a problem like this. 
5613	because even if they are the most studious person in the world that temptation to become distracted will still always be there. Someone who demonstrates this perfectly is my friend Generic_Name. Generic_Name is probably one of the most hard working people I have ever known, not only does he take high level courses for his age but he also does track all while being home schooled. Not only will he deny every offer of a hangout but he will also stay up way later than he should just to finish his latest assignment, but even though he does all of these things I will occasionally catch him logging into Minecraft when I know he shouldnt be, and because of this he usually has awful time management skills. This just goes to show how distance learning not only makes it easier to become distracted because of how convenient it is but also how it enforces bad study habits because of the lack of a classroom.  
5614	What have Richard nixon, Jimmy carter, Bob dole, and the AFL-CIO all, in their own time, agreed on? They all agreed on abolishing the electoral college 
5615	I believe that the Electoral College should stay. 
5616	I believe this because even though many people think of it as a horrible way to have presidential elections, it's probably more effective this way. 
5617	The Electoral College seems as though our government wouldn't stand for this. 
5618	I assume that the entire voting system, no matter how much we change it for better, will always be flawed and have the most flaws because we are choosing the leader of our nation. 
5619	Someone somewhere will always do something wrong or figure out how to cheat the system in some way. The Electoral College is going to be the best way to handle this situation for a while. The people need to realize that their vote does matter 
5620	I am aware that you may take the action of making community service a requirement to all students. This action is inevitably going to cause controversy among students 
5621	I for one am very against this upcoming decision. 
5622	We already have physical education to make us do physical work for a letter grade. Although P. E does this to some extent community service would be outrages. Sweating for an A ? I quite frankly do not think so. 
5623	Dear state senator, I am wriitting you this letter to argue about removing the Electoral college. 
5624	Using the electoral college has caused some disrruption when its it comes to the votes. 
5625	"From the article ""The indefensible electoral college"" it says that ""under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors"". Who are the electors? well anyone can be an elector not holding public office. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? no. these are one of the reasons to remove the electoral college. "
5626	Also, the electoral college should be removed because of the 2000 voting fiasco that happened. 
5627	"from the article ""The indefensible electoral colllege"" it says it was the biggest election crisis in the century"". Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for  picking electors, and that those electors wioll always defy the will of the people. If we the people vote for our choice to run this country their should not be any of these fiascos. "
5628	Next, even presidents, AFL-CIO in their time have aggreed with this. they all want to remove the electoral college. 
5629	"according to the article a gallup pole in 2000, taken shortly after Algore thanks to the quirks of the electoral college won the popular vote but won the presidency, over 60 percent of the voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. Electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner take all system in each state, canidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. "
5630	after that 2000 fiasco why would you still have have the electoral college.  
5631	If students dont live near any schools that can provide a good education they can do online classes for a better school, 
5632	If a student is sick they dont have to miss any class work and have their grade effected, 
5633	And if a student has to leave their town they would be able to keep up with their work.  
5634	Some students who live near lower quality school wont get a very good education, But if they had online classes they would have an opportunity to learn at a higher level. 
5635	Generic_Name lives in a low income area of where he lives and his education is not going the best but with online schooling he could receive education from elsewhere. There are millions of students just like Generic_Name that just want a better education, and with online school this is possible. This isnt just low income areas many schools in higher income areas give poor educations too. Generic_Name lives in north Dakota and there are NO schools in his area but with online classes he could attend online school in a different state. Rather than living near a low quality school Generic_Name dose not live near any schools at all. With online schooling Generic_Name could get the education he needs to be a success in the modern world. In conclusion online schooling give learning opportunities to those who would not normally receive them. 
5636	Students all over the united states and the world get sick everyday, But with online classes obstacles such as these would not be as detrimental. 
5637	In October Generic_Name missed two weeks of school because he had the flu and couldnt leave his bed but if he would have had online classes he could just have done them from home and not have had his grades impacted so severely. Like many others Generic_Name had become sick and had to miss school and many assignments if he would have been able to do his classes online There would have been little to no impact. If more schools would pick up online schooling there would not be incidents like this anymore. Generic_Name recently got back from a trip to France with his family and unfortunately was infected with COVID-19 ( Coronavirus) and now he will have to miss an extended period of school and be quarantined meaning he cant receive an education, But if he could do his work online he would be able to continue to receive an education while quarantined. This being a much more serious scenario of missing school that as of right now schools should start to take into consideration, none the less having online school would solve one of the problems this child is facing. Both of these students could have their grades remain intact if there was online schooling. In conclusion there would be no more need for sick days if when a student is sick they can just work from home. 
5638	If a student has to leave town for one reason or another they would still receive an education along as they had access to a computer 
5639	Generic_Name went on vacation to Generic_City with her family four days before spring break started so she missed a little bit of school, But if she brought a computer she would not have to fall behind. Generic_Name had to miss school but she had a computer with her so there would be no problem if she could do her work online. This might seem silly to some schools but it would be very helpful to students. Generic_Name had to leave Virginia because her grandmother was diagnosed with cancer and her family wanted to spend time with her in her final months if there was a computer there Generic_Name wouldnt have to miss any class work. Some scenarios of students not being in school are much more serious and the make-up work could be solved while they're away. If there was online school Generic_Name would have one less thing to worry about when she returned. In conclusion online school could help students with catching up on missed class for any reason. 
5640	In conclusion if students could attend school online it would solve problems such as, Not living near any schools or any decent schools, students falling ill and being un-able to attend school regularly, And finally If students needed to miss school for family matters. Some might say that having students learn online would encourage them to procrastinate or just skip but not all students are going to just skip school and procrastinate this would actually solve a big problem for many students. In conclusion schools providing online school would solve many more problems than it would create, and it would create new teaching jobs. 
5641	Because of the winer takes all system in each state it's unfair to the voters and it's unfair to me so changing the election by popular votes for the president of the united states would be best. 
5642	can make a student gain confidence, 
5643	This is great for those who have to bend their schedule a some to fit in some class time during the week. Not only that, but online classes have even been shown to allow students to get jobs and make some money while they are attending these classes for things they need to advance in life. Online classes can even be scheduled nowadays, but that feature is only at some schools. This flexibility may come in handy for when you need to get a check up, or even if you have a serious medical issue and need to find out what it is. 
5644	Shyness is something students have a lot of. In fact, almost 60 percent of students have some shyness in them if not at all. This shyness can affect if not ruin the class, making new friends, and even doing classwork with other students when needed. Online classes can solve this as they can give a sense of friendliness towards strangers. 
5645	Though many complain that they are not shy and need to talk with someone in person, 
5646	This allows even moderately shy students the ability to focus on their class, or classes, and not worry about having to be shy towards teachers and fellow students. 
5647	Multitasking is a crucial thing in life for you will need to do it most of your life anyway. From running errands to visiting your doctor on the same day, online classes are able to allow time for multitasking. In 2009, they found out those who did online classes multitask better than those who were always on campus to take the same class. This is very good since multitasking is a crucial life skill, and online classes can help this at home. when at home online classes can allow a person to do his laundry, clean his house, and even do dishes and still be in class. 
5648	Another reason for multitasking is that it can improve your flexibility by at least 25 percent, and that is great for those who need to fit in time for other things in life such as exercise. 
5649	As I mentioned, online classes are popular and do benefit students. They do this by helping cut costs and help save them money for things they need most in life, flexibility to make up work and to do things that they need to in life, help a student build or gain confidence, and allow for multitasking. This all helps a student get through a class by improving the class conditions, or by making it more comfortable for them emotionally. Though online classes aren`t in person and some classes are not very flexible, they can help shy students feel less worried. And as I mentioned as well, there are a lot of schools that may offer the same class with better flexibility than the school you want to go for that class.  Overall, online classes can help a student get through a class cheaply, confidently, with flexibility, and with the ability of multitasking.  
5650	due to the extreamly dangerous potental the driverless car has. 
5651	If you were to get in a car accident who would be to blame ? The car or the driver ? 
5652	The computer of the car could have so many errors that could potentally injure another human on the roads.  
5653	The dangerous potental the car has is, it can accelerate on its own. 
5654	In that car crash you have to give the poliece your insurance redgerstration ext. When you file the insurance claim whos fault it the accident? Yourself or the car manufacturers? 
5655	Technology fails everyday so why put it in a car and put human lives at risk? 
5656	however it could also fail resulting in the faitality of another human 
5657	 Admitting that technology is a great advantage and is used everywhere today. The point is greater technology than what we have now should stay off the roads. Keeping technology off the roads can save lives and prevent accidents waiting to happen. The danger of auto accelaration, heads-up system, and not knowing whos fault the accident was your's or the car's, is absalutely not worth the life of a human.           
5658	When considering whether or not to allow children to participate in sports or other activities without an average above a C, what one must remember is that everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses. Yes, many people excel in academics, but there are others, who math and science just don't click with them. By saying these more athletically inclined individuals cannot participate in their medium, you take away one of their great pleasures. Some kids get a rush when they find out they aced their midterm, but others take greater pleasure in scoring the winning touchdown or participating in a club where you help others. 
5659	Without something for the non-academic children to shine at, their confidence may be slashed leaving devastating consequences throughout the rest of their lives. 
5660	There are many speculations and theories as to why some kids can't perform as well as others in school, and so they turn to sports or other clubs. 
5661	Many of these theories include that they just have too much energy and can't stay focused, or these children have bad time management and so they don't do their homework or complete their assignments. Clubs and sports can allow the underachievers to get out some of their excess energy, so they can stay on task and perform better. When they are practicing four days a week with games on the weekend, kids don't have times to dilly-dally, so they learn time management and perform better in class. 
5662	By taking away clubs and activities unless they have a certain grade, one may be removing the one and only aspect of school that certain individuals enjoy. 
5663	Some say that sports cause kids to not focus on school as much and that by forcing them to have higher grades before they can join you get immediate results, 
5664	School sports and clubs should be allowed no matter what the students grade is. 
5665	Also, with the embarrassingly low voter turnout the USA has already, having a confusing, old-fashioned and unfair system of electing leaders will only decrease the amount of citizens that actually go to the polls. Studies like the one published September 1st, 2012 by the American Research Institute, have shown that the average American person doesn't know very much about their country and how it works. Those that do are a minority. So, why would the government that is supposed to be looking out for, protecting and listening to its citizens still use a system that only deters already ignorant people from participating in elections? 
5666	Secondly, the electoral college (in addition to putting down the voter) has been proven to be faulty. 
5667	Driverless cars could be the future of our generation. Many car companies have taken this idea and are trying to pursue it. They are cars that, eventually, will drive by themselves. It seems like a very creative and speechless innovation. However, there are many questionable aspects of the car that need to be taken into account. 
5668	Drivers today have to go through intensive studying and classes just to gain a license. They think of it as the first step into adulthood and freedom. If driverless cars do take over our population, that will disapear. 
5669	"Teens will look past the greatness of being able to drive, and will look for another way to gain the freedom that they are desperatley seeking for. They also will not have anything that they are in complete control of. In the article it says, ""He envisions a future with a public-transportation system where fleets of driverless cars form a public-transportation taxi system."" If this happens, teens would not be in conrol of the car, the car would. That leaves kids to rely on yet another thing in their lives. Teens already have to rely on many things everyday. I think that if we add another one, and take away that sense of freedom, we will be taking away a big part of life. This is one reason I do not think driverless cars are a good idea. "
5670	"Technology should not be relied on for big tasks like driving. Car companies are being thourough and making sure they are safe, but technology, even today, still seems to occasionally mess up. In the article it says, ""Most drvining laws focus on keeping drivers, passengers, and pedestrians safe, and lawmakers know that safety is best achieved with alert drivers."" I agree that the best way to ensure safety is with a driver that is focused and knowledged. These driverless cars could potentially be dangerous to us. If the car messes up even once, or the company makes a mistake in the programming, we could definately be in great danger. Safety is the most important thing, and because we can never be 100% sure that technology won't mess up, we should not have driverless cars in the future. "
5671	". If a regular car gets into an accident, we have laws that say who should be at fault. Also, it can already be complicated to figure out who should take the blame today with regular cars. If we all drove driverles cars, a new stack of laws would have to be made to support them. Getting used to those laws would be hard because we have never lived in the world of driverless cars. In the article it says, ""If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?"" This is a good point. If there is an accident where someone gets injured, not everyone will agree who should take the fall for it. There will be riots and fighting between manufacturers and individuals, and overall, it is not worth it. We should not destroy what we already have for something this risky. "
5672	These are the reasons that I do not think driverless cars should be pursued by car companies. I do agree that they would be very cool, but they are in fact, to good to be true. With the many complications that could come up, to the lack of freedom in teens, driverless cars take away more than what they could be bringing. Instead of investing in this innovation, we should use the investments to pursue more practical products, and to continue to make what we already have, better. Driving comes with a great responsibility that technology does not have. That is why I do not think driverless cars are a good idea for the safety of our generations.           
5673	While most argue that the Electoral College is a violation of freedom, I strongly believe that the Electoral College premotes equality 
5674	for the candidates 
5675	the people. 
5676	Opposers might say that our votes don't even matter due to the fact that the popular vote doesn't directly determine our nation's President. 
5677	This is far from reality, because the popular vote is vital to the Electoral College. 
5678	"For example, in ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,"" Bradford Plumer whines about how, ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters,"" going on to say that, ""Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states,"" (Plumer 13). "
5679	"However, Richard A. Posner makes a fair point: ""The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal. "
5680	"Overall, the Electoral College is a symbol of our freedom of speech. I do hope you take my thoughts under consideration. The Electoral College may be called ""outdated."" But as the saying goes, ""If it 'aint broke, don't fix it."" "
5681	Many school systems now offer an option of attending online classes either in conjunction with a students school year classes or during summer break. Though this opportunity may presumably appear to provide many advantages, there are many typically unacknowledged resulting consequences that lead me to argue that this type of schooling does not compare to hands on learning in the classroom. 
5682	Students would not benefit nearly as much from online classes than in the classroom 
5683	it allows easy potential for students to struggle to comprehend material but lack teacher assistance 
5684	education at home provides far more accessibility to distractions and cheating than in a supervised classroom 
5685	requiring students to spend long hours comprehending difficult material can become increasingly straining and taxing on both the mind and body. 
5686	Online courses are not beneficial to students learning as without an educational professional present to guide them, students can easily struggle to comprehend difficult concepts. 
5687	I myself enrolled in an online geometry course during one summer and although there were occasional scheduled conference calls, a majority of the course was done independently and free of assistance. Working at your own pace isn't so appealing once a student has been presented an overwhelming amount of difficult material to learn with no other guidance, requiring many more hours dedicated to struggling to comprehend material than if they had a qualified teacher present. Additionally, these courses usually require a specific amount of learning to be completed each day, so the idea a student can leisurely complete assignments is a huge misconception. 
5688	Another reason online classes are not as beneficial as they may appear is that students face constant distraction and opportunity to cheat at home than if they were in the classroom. 
5689	It's easy to think there would actually be less distraction in the quiet of your own home than classrooms that can sometimes be full of loud and troublesome students, subsequently making it hard to focus at times. 
5690	However, schools often implement strict regulations on phones, food, and talking as they know how much these things can be a distraction to a learning environment. 
5691	At home with no teacher supervision, students may find themselves easily distracted by electronics and the accessibility to get up and do other things in the comfort of their own house. This results it it taking even longer to get through material and presents the risk of students missing out on important information. Moreover, without teacher supervision it may become tempting for the student to cheat on assignments as it is far more easy to get away with and there would be no one present to enact consequences. I've heard many student discussing taking online courses for the sole purpose that they know they can find answer keys and other materials to cheat online. In my particular situation, only my midterm and final exam were monitored in a public setting, leaving opportunity for other students to cheat on any test, quiz, or other classwork assignment. 
5692	Lastly, online courses typically require a large amount of material to be learned each day requiring long hours at the computer and subsequent negative health effects considering the strain on the students mind and body. 
5693	but in combination with having to read a screen for hours, the student must also be actively trying to learn difficult material, which becomes extremely straining on the eyes and taxing on the mind. 
5694	School educators were trained to provide the best possible education for a student, and by eliminating that invaluable resource by taking an online course, you have know placed an unqualified student in charge of their own self directed education. Any presumable benefit provided by an online course, has a subsequent consequence that is usually not considered. To this day I regret enrolling in that geometry course, as it moved at too fast of a pace to where I consequently find myself struggling to grasp those concepts today. Online courses simply cannot effectively supplement for a students present education in the classroom. Taking online courses does far more harm than any good to students by allowing easy potential for students to struggle to comprehend difficult material without teacher guidance, education at home provides easy accessibility to distractions and cheating without supervision, and long hours of comprehending massive amounts of material can leave the mind and body drained and exhausted. Teachers will always provide the best possible learning experience, and students should always take advantage of that resource. 
5695	I can just imagine how the near future ahead may look. From time to time I ask my great grandmother questions about the life she had growing up and im always amazed by the comaparison to the life that I live. I have grown up with technology at my fingertips, techonology from the alarm that wakes me up to the music I listen to on my ipod when I go to sleep. Growing up I don't remember getting lost and having to ever ask for direcions when traveling out of state with my family. We simply used our GPS system. I like watching movies on the car when we go places, and I life the rear camara on the car that helps us drive safely. These new techonologies have made our lives much easier and thanks to those bright minds that have created and innovated the techonlogy we have.  As time goes by, we as a society must make progress, and its clear that we have. Along with progress comes some disagreements and possible dangers thanks to time and acceptace from our society we have made great improvements from, lets say the time my great grandma was just a young girl. 
5696	The improvents cars have made have been done for own advantage 
5697	yes, one could arugue the dangers of having a driveless car, since a driveless car is not the same as just having better brakes or a Google car that still has a human in control of it 
5698	but it's evident that since the past there have been innovations made to cars and our everyday lives that has only led to greater things through out the decades.  
5699	These new cars have challeges to overcome and these challeges are the reason some oppose the idea 
5700	To this day auto makers are continuing their work on the assuption that problems ahead will be solved and as a member of the future I look foward to those soutions and the positive changes it may bring and I want to be able share progress stories one day of how far we have come. 
5701	Many citizens in the United States vote for whom they believe will acheive the goals and standards of serving as the U.S President. People think the process of voting is simple, but is it really? In the U.S, there is the Electoral College, which is'nt such a good thing for some people. 
5702	voters can't control whom their electors vote for 
5703	"The Electoral College process allows citizens to vote for an elector in their state whom they believe will choose their prefered president. If the elector of their choice wins the statewide election with 87 votes, the elector votes for their prefered president along with the 87 votes. As stated in source 2 ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always."" "
5704	"When the elector votes for their prefered president, all the votes used on that elector counts for the president. Instead of going through this whole process, would'nt it be less of a struggle to just have citizens vote for the president of their choice and win by popular votes? Also stated in source 2 ""Do voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candidate? Sometimes."" This shows how the Electoral College is difficult to understand for some people. The Unites States consists of many people who come from other counrties and speak other languages. This makes it even more complicated for some to understand even if the process is translated, and just by eliminating this process, it could make Presidential elections less complicated. "
5705	"The people make the decisions, the people vote for what they want and the people should be able to elect a president they believe will give them that! According to source 3 ""... it is the electors who elect the president, not the people."" Why can't the people be the electors? If the people in the United States don't have the freedom to vote for a president of their choice, what say do they really have? Electing a president is like raising money for charity, the president does all the work but all they money that is raised goes to charity (the people). The people want someone who will help raise the money for them, not screw over their charity. Just like when signing up for a job the boss needs to see your resume, is like the people needing to see what the president can do to help their country. The citizens should be the ones making the decisions with help from the president that they believe could help with such decisions, not from electors who believe so. "
5706	Electing a president is very important to the country. Electing the president that people think could help support the U.S is also very important but very difficult as well. People should be able to easily vote for their prefered president with no difficulty, which happens to be caused by the Electoral College. By aborting this process, voters could control who they vote for and have a say in their country by voting for their prefered president. Having citizens tricked into voting for an elector is not the way to elect a president. Should'nt people in the Unites States have a say in who their president should be without being tricked?                         
5707	Everyone loves the idea of being able to stay home and complete all of their work from home. Sounds good right? Well it might not be as good as you think it would. Being home schooled, as some would call it, is not as beneficial as someone would think. Yes, the idea of having to wake up in the morning and go to school is hard for most people, but in reality going to an actual physical school can help you in many ways. Some people argue that even though this might be true it's still better for kids to do their work at home. 
5708	Most students dislike the idea of waking up in the morning and going to school, but they don't realize that school will eventually help them prepare for the real world. 
5709	In every single class offered at school, from math to art, each class is able to teach their students something valuable that will help them succeed in the future. For example, it's very important that everyone no matter their age has good communication skills and is able to work well with others. If kids don't attend school then how are they going to be able to strengthen these important skills if they're at home. It's very important for someone to have these skills in order for them to function in the real world. Imagine getting a part time job at your favorite cafe and then getting fired because you can't communicate well and work with your fellow employees. That would be horrible and could potentially happen again because of the lack of basic skills. By going to school we can assure that kids learn these skills and will be able to do well on: job interviews, be able to communicate with others, and work well with anyone they meet. Time goes by fast and sooner than later kids will grow up and venture out into the real world we must make sure they are ready; and this can only be done if they attend school regularly. 
5710	We all have that one subject that stresses us so much our heads feel like they're going to explode any minute. Well by attending a physical school it may help you get some of the stress off. 
5711	Schools have a day where both teachers and students can meet in order to do missing work or get the extra help they need. My school for example offers a specific class called lancer time where kids get a pass from their teachers and go to them for any reason possible. If you still need help then you can stay after school on a specific day and there is transportation provided. This is very convenient because if at any given moment a student needs help with something they can go and get it. Home schooled students don't have this option because they are being taught at home and arent' attending a school. This is very inconvenient because what would happen if a student needs help with something, they won't be able to get the help they need. If you attend a physical school then it's going to be very easy for you to get the help you need whenever you need it. Another way is by going to a class full of people you can get someone, like a friend, to help you and then you can both compare work to see if you are doing it right. If you're home schooled then you don't really have the option to have your friend help you or have any way of making sure your work is correct. That being said it's better for students to go to an actual physical school, so that they are able to get the help they need in order to succeed. 
5712	That being said if students are able to attend classes from home then they will be able to self pace themselves especially in classes that are hard for them. 
5713	Let's say they're not that good at math, if they're at home they can take their time in order for them to fully understand the concept. By allowing them to do the work at home we are helping them more, than by sending them to school and watching as they don't understand anything because of how fast the class pace is. 
5714	where one can barely focus due to how loud some people can be. This will have a big impact on how they function, at school they might not focus due to all of the noise,and fail, but at home it's quiet and they will be able to focus way better. We all want our students to do well in school and the only way to ensure that is if we allow students to attend classes from home.  
5715	In conclusion, students will not benefit from attending classes from home because they aren't going to be well prepared to venture out into the real world. Everyone needs an important set of skills in order for them to function and this can only be done by attending an actual physical school. We should all make sure that every single students is well prepared for the world. We want them to accomplish great things and be able to feel happy about what they accomplished. That being said the only way for students to feel that way is by sending them to school. Even though the idea of being able to attend classes from home sounds really good it will not help you prepare. It's more important to go to an actual school to learn the necessary things you will need than by doing classes from home and not be prepare for the real world.     
5716	Another factor is getting more sleep. Typically when teachers ask how much sleep their students get at home the in my experience the usual response is five to six hours. The recommended amount of sleep teens should be getting at least is eight hours and at most ten. The teachers on the other hand aren't surprised by those numbers the students come out with due to how many of them play sports and take AP classes. This can also cause a lot of stress like on test days, important sports competitions, or cramming in assignments last minute because other classes are assigning multiple projects due in the same week. 
5717	In conclusion attending online course could be beneficial to those struggling to attend school while dealing with bullying, stress, and or depression. It can also help work on their independence in the future with colledge or a day job. Even though it can also cause a few problems like laziness, it can easily be solved through motivation. Overall it should be provided by more schools so that parents can consider it an option. 
5718	I think this because it help out our country. We will have less trash all over the streets. 
5719	There will be more stuff we can put in the recycling bin instead of throwing it away we can renew it save on killing in trees that we killing in rainforest. animals in water will not die if we don't throw things in sewers. 
5720	If we tutor little elementary kids that will help them improve their grades better in their classroom. 
5721	We can go to the elderly hospital and help the workers with their jobs. 
5722	The senior citizens might would like to talk to some young kids every once in a while. 
5723	We should help some adults 
5724	Phones are also great for emergencies, whether it's to call your parents about a school bus running late or if it's calling the police for a wanted criminal taking you hostage at the school. 
5725	What harm would it do to allow students to use their phones during their lunch and break times? Class wouldn't be disrupted, teachers wouldn't be annoyed, and the students would still be able to have the phones that they enjoy using every day. By changing the phone policy, the school would be taking our rights away. This is also very unfair to those who use their phones outside of class. If we can't be trusted with phones only during our break times, then the school would be showing us great disrespect 
5726	In the real world, employers are not going to wait around for whenever their employee wakes up, they are going to set a time when the employee should be at work and expect them to be there. Employers aren't usually looking for candidates that show up late to interviews or employees who show up late to work every day. Not being punctual can not only hurt people in their professional lives, but also in their personal lives. Friends, family members, and significant others are going to want to invite their loved one to breakfasts, lunches, parties, and more and are going to be upset and angry when they show up late or not at all, which could end up with that person losing a lot of people whom they care about 
5727	People who attend online school may feel like outsiders in these groups of students of which all go to the same public school. To add to the social skills provided by public schools, students even attain social skills just by showing up and interacting with their peers, teachers, and administrators. Students who are schooled online may not know what type of relationship or the nature of interactions they should have with future employers or coworkers because that is something that puclic school students practice every day without thought, therefore it is not in the curriculum for the online students to learn 
5728	Branching off of social skills, online school students may not know how to interact with those who are different than them due to only being exposed to their family and neighbors on a daily basis. 
5729	Public school students encounter people of many different races, religions, sexualities, ableness, and neuro activity. Because of this, these students have no problem facing the real world with all the people who are nothing like them. Online students may experience a type of culture shock when they go to college or enter the workforce and meet a person who is a different race than them, someone with a disibility, a person on the autism spectrum, or even a person who practices a different religion than they do. This is a sensation unknown to most public school students because of how they are exposed to many different and diverse groups of people at a young age. This type of culture shock could cause problems for these online students in our increasingly open-minded and progressive world. 
5730	Consequently, the new technology that made online school an option also created a new type of bullying, cyberbullying. Even attending school online cannot prevent one from being cyberbullied as it is through the very technology the use for their education. 
5731	In public schools students can learn how to deal with bullies and how to react when people are less than nice to them but online school students may not know how to handle cyberbullying and become unstable. This contradicts the argument that online school is better than public schools for the mental health of students. Many public schools now have zero tolerance bullying policies and have student clubs and organizations that conduct in-school activities to counteract bullying and provide safe spaces for students.  
5732	Ultimately, there are benefits and disadvantages to both online and public school and all students are different so it is up to parents and students to communicate and find what is the right choice for them. The question I believe should be posed when deciding between an online school and a public school is, how are people supposed to adapt and learn from the world if they are sheltered from the very world they are meant to grow with? The answer is very simple, they cannot.  
5733	I disagree with your idea to require students to participate in community services. In my opinion we should have a choice in those sorts of things. Not only that but, what about homework, family, and other school or home related activities? 
5734	There are some up sides to that idea and i understand that it would help the environment and make the neighborhood look a lot better. 
5735	I'm positive that there are some students that may want to do that and that is great. Let those individuals choose what they would like to do. 
5736	When would the students have time for the community service? Would it be during or after school? In my point of view either way would be interfering with either grades or home. 
5737	If we have community service it will make our community a nicer place to be with happier people. 
5738	Lastly it will help out our environment. this town needs it. 
5739	For an hour we could do things like clean up garbage. We could do things for the people and help our senior citizens, help the children of working parents, or even help people who are having dangerous though and who are unhappy. Also we could build something, maybe help build a park or even a new building. If any of these things were done it would benefit the community tremendously 
5740	There is garbage on the sides of highways and streets that have been sitting there forever. We could clean up parks and make them safer for children to play on. Also we could wash graffiti off of buildings by paint over them or scrubbing it off. This will only take one hour a week and will be something fun that all of the middle school kids can do together with their friends. Also it will make all the fun places around town safer for everyone. 
5741	There are things that animals will die if they eat, like gum for instance they will choke on it and die. Also many birds die each year from those rings that hold soda and beer cans, they usually wrap around there necks and kill the animals. Lastly if we put the garbage in bins the animals may not come into neighbor hoods and then will avoid being hit by cars. Just one hour of our time can save the lives of many animals. 
5742	I would argue in favor of keeping the electoral college 
5743	I remeber My sixteenth birthday I woke up bright and early and went stright to the BMV. I was about to get the best gift that could be given to a teenager a gift of freedom,trust,and responsbility I was going to get my lisence. I was so excited to begin driveing I loved it driverless cars would take the joy of driving away. 
5744	There will always be need for human alertness in the vehicle. 
5745	What happens when there is a crash who is responsble the manufacture or owner of the smart car. 
5746	With driverless cars there would no longer be any excitment of getting your lisence.  
5747	Driverless cars are so expenseive its not practical to own one 
5748	If you were to buy a driver less car you would expect to relax during the car ride. 
5749	Actually driveless cars still and will always require human assitance. 
5750	These driverless cars arnt really driverless the will always require human alertness and asitance while in the vihicle. 
5751	What will happen if you are in a smart car and there is a crash. 
5752	The devolpment of driverless cars is a waste of our time and money. Cars will always be somewhat dependent on humans the will never be truly driverless. there will be many liability issuse if an accedent takes place. And what will be the fun in getting your lisence to just sit in a car that drivers itself. I want my children to feel the same way I did when I turned sixteen. I want to be able to give them same gift my dads gave me the gift of reponsbility, trust, and freedom.        
5753	Many adults are suspicious of students if they call in stick. This suspicion is not unfounded either, many high school students feign sickness to get out of tests or to escape an impending due date. But for some students, feigning an illness is not an option. For these high achieving students, being sick could mean a week of catching up on missed material, even if only one day of class is missed. 
5754	Although some students may try to take advantage of a long distance learning system, it can greatly reduce the stress of missing class and keep students from falling behind.  
5755	Implementing a long distance learning approach would reduce the stress of missing class commonly felt by high achieving students. 
5756	High school schedules can be so packed with classes, missing only one day can lead to a week or more of trying to catch up on tests, assignments, and notes. These students, to avoid missing class, often downplay illnesses that otherwise would have kept them at home. A long distance learning approach would allow students who are sick to stay at home while still learning, participating in class, and getting any important dates or other information that may have been mentioned in the class. This will reduce the time the student must spend catching up and encourage the student to stay at home when they are sick. This, in turn, will keep diseases like the flu from spreading rapidly through the school system as fewer students come to class sick. If the lessons are recorded, a student missing school for an event can catch up on classes at times teachers are usually unavailable. Many students choose not to attend academic competitions, extracurricular activities, and other important events during the school day because of the fear of missing class. Recording lectures encourages these students to pursue academic enrichment outside of the classroom as they do not have to worry as much about catching up on classes. They can play back these recordings during times when teachers are not commonly available which decreases the time it takes students to catch up on missed work, thus reducing the stress of missing class. 
5757	Adding a long distance learning system to the classroom would also prevent chronically ill students who cannot attend classes regularly from falling behind. 
5758	Many students with illnesses such as Lyme disease are forced to skip class due to their illness. If too many days are missed, the student can fall behind in class and many be forced to repeat a class or an entire year. This causes an unneeded burden on the student, the family, and the school system. The aforesaid parties would greatly benefit from a remote learning system as the chronically ill student would be able to keep pace with the class from home. This reduces the probability that the student fails the class and is forced to repeat it. By making lectures available online, these students, and all students for that matter, would be given the chance to earn a higher grade as working outside of the class is more efficient. Students who want to study for an exam can go back through old lectures to ensure that they know all of the important information presented in class. This would result in higher grades, fewer failing students, and a better chance of success in college and later in life. 
5759	Implementing a remote learning system may encourage some students to skip class for no reason. 
5760	High school can be a time of great stress on students. The level of performance mandated by some classes requires students spend more time and effort than ever before to maintain academic performance. Given that, it is important that all students are supported at this stage in their life. A bad or stressful experience in high school can discourage students from pursuing college or other challenging achievements. Implementing a long distance learning system at the high school level would give students the support they need to make the best of their high school experience and continue learning throughout their life. 
5761	"In 1976 NASA released a photo of a landform on Mars resembling a human face. Not everyone was easily convinced that it was only just a landmass though. Conspiracy theorists believed that it was, ""Bona fide evidence of life on Mars."" In the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars,"" the author, Garvin, believed that it was only a mesa. "
5762	There is a large amount of proof in the article that was confirmed by NASA that this face is only a landmass, nothing more. 
5763	"In paragraph two of the article the author claimed that mesa's were ordinary in Cydonia, area the mesa was located, according to scientists. The only difference between this mesa and other mesa's found on Mars is that it had uncommon shadows over it illustrating eyes and a mouth. Since mesa's are common in this area it is very unlikely that this, ""face,"" was anything different than just an average mesa taken at an odd angle with a low quality camera. "
5764	The author also stated in paragraph seven that in 1998 that the photo was retaken with a higher quality camera. 
5765	According to paragraph ten in the article, the picture was taken one last time of the landmass revealing the same thing, an average mesa. 
5766	Mesa's also are found commonly in the american west as said in paragraph eleven. 
5767	but the only reason the mesa on Mars has a face is due to the angle at which the picture was taken as I said earlier in my piece. 
5768	The two oppsing sides in this argument have evidence to argue their opinion. The belief that the mesa is actually a face is inncorect due to evidence in the article and my essay. Mesa's are common in the area the picture was taken and the face was caused by shadows along with a low quality camera. Whichever side you are on I believe I have brought forth enough evidence to change your opinion or strengthen your opionion that there was no alien lifeforms yet found on Mars. 
5769	i believe that the students of this school should be required to do community service. 
5770	doing community service helps learn about the responsibilities of being an adult. 
5771	it does this by teaching them that you don't always need to get something in return for what you do. 
5772	it also can help build self-esteem, 
5773	because it makes you feel good about helping your town and the people in it 
5774	it also allows you to pass high school 
5775	because there is a required amount of hours of community service to graduate from high school. that is important because if you don't graduate from high school you will never be able to go to college and you won't get a good job to support you and a family. 
5776	Parents are always looking for new ways to give their student the best education possible, but for some, the options available are not suitable for their student. Distance learning is a possible new option in which students can learn from home using online classes and possible video contact with their teachers 
5777	it will allow students who are often absent to miss less of the curriculum and allow for easier catch up if work is missed 
5778	llow students who struggle with social situations to learn and ask questions in a stress-free environment 
5779	give students the time they need to learn material or complete certain assignments. 
5780	Online classes will allow students who have frequent absences to attend class and make up work with more ease 
5781	Students miss school for many reasons, such as illness, travel, or family struggles, and each of these possibilities are often unavoidable. Classes at home would allow more flexibility for these students. In all cases, the ability to be at home would also allow these students to work when convenient, whether it is when they are feeling better or they have down time on a trip. Students should still be allowed absences in certain circumstances. If they miss a class, rather than having all of their work piled up and having to schedule time with each teacher, they can do the work from home, not having to worry about the schedules of anyone but themselves. A great example is students with poor immune systems that get sick quite often. Depending on the severity of the illness, students who are home sick could attend classes without the fear of contaminating others or getting exposed to worse germs, and allow them to avoid a place that houses countless bacteria and viruses that could cause an illness at any time. 
5782	Not only this, but on a day that a sick student stays home from school, they often have periods of feeling better and having more energy, so these periods could be utilized for working on classwork, a luxury that is not available in a school building. If this same student were taking classes at school and missed an assessment in class, they would have to schedule time outside of that class and coordinate to find a time that is available for both them and their teacher to make up the work. However, if this student missed an assessment that was online, they would be able to make it up any time that they are free, not having the restrictions of seven hours of a tight packed schedule or specific times in the day 
5783	Distance classes would allow for less absences and missing work, improving the experience of both students and teachers. 
5784	Anxiety is becoming increasingly more common and that anxiety is often caused by social interactions. For students with such stresses, asking questions in class and asking teachers or fellow students for help is very difficult. The ability to ask such questions online will make them more comfortable and able to learn. If a student is unable to ask a question in class because they fear that they will be judged or make a mistake, they will continue to be confused about whatever it is they had a question about 
5785	If the class they are taking is online, that student could ask their teacher a question privately, with the ability to edit their phrasing, and get an answer the way they can understand it. Students would not have the everyday interaction of a usual classroom atmosphere, but students that choose at home classes will have greater benefits and can seek connections in a more comfortable setting for them. 
5786	Giving the option of at home classes would allow students to get a more personalized education. 
5787	Every student has a different way of learning, so, many students struggle through classes because they are not being taught the way they learn best. Some students learn best by taking notes, while others learn by doing hands on activities. Some students can hear something once and be able to understand fully, while others take more time to process. At home classes gives students the ability to take the time they need to learn material and complete classwork. One student may only have to listen to a teacher lecture and take little to no notes to understand a topic. Another student may need to listen, take extensive notes, and reread or write their notes in order to gain a fraction of the understanding, but they are not able to do this in class. If the expectation in a class is that you are able to complete an activity after 30 minutes of a teacher talking, but that is not how some students learn, those students will be lost and fall behind the others. With classes at home and online, they would be able to take the time they needed to grasp a topic before moving on to use what they just learned. At home learning allows students to practice the learning style that helps them learn the best. 
5788	Distance learning should be an option for students because they are able to stay on top of their work when they are not at their best, have a learning environment that works well for them, and have the time needed to learn material. Just like any other new way of learning, there are concerns, but the benefits of distance learning greatly outweigh those concerns. This type of learning is only one of the many options for parents and students to choose from in order to get the best education and though it may not be best for some students, that should not take away the option from others. 
5789	Driverless cars are a thing of the future. They would be very useful especially if they use less fuel than normal taxis, but in stituations where there is dangerous road conditions, like snowing flooding, and high winds, how will the car react? 
5790	With the weather always chaning will the driverless car be able keep up or will everybody just have to stop what they're doing? The weather influences driving greatly. You have to be able to drive in any condition, thats why driverless car aren't ready. If the driverless car needs someone to take over when theres road work and accidents, the same thing would happen in dangerous driving conditions. The car could not tell that there is ice on the roads. Sometimes cars hydroplane, the smart car would not be albe to right the car but, just spin out and take the impact and put lives in danger. This would increase accidents or even deaths 
5791	These cars aren't safe to drive in conditions like these. The smart car isn't smart enough to be driving in different types of weather or situations.  
5792	There are times in traffic that traffic ligths go out and people have to make decisions. The car can not think to stop at a flashing ready light and then yield to oncoming cars. 
5793	There are situations there a person is the best option. Unless the car can think for it self. The drivrless car is too unpredicatable and can put peoples lives in danger. Accidents occur all the time, i don't believe a driverless car can avoid an ongoing accident. Then there are situations with police, or stolen cars. Would the car give away its owner if they were on the run from the police? How would traffic stops work, would the car be so perfect to not break the law? The car could be harboring fugitives or runways or even kidnapped victims. The car wouldnt be smart enought to know, its going to do what its told and drive. 
5794	i dont believe that self driving cars are ready for todays society nor will they ever be. The road is alwasy changing and the car would not be able to keep up. 
5795	Some kids look at community service as a bad thing. When you think of community service most people would think of picking up trash. Say a student hated picking up trash but for community service made him pick up trash. He would learn form this to mot litter because there are people that go around and pick up trash and now he know what it is like. Another example is say a student helping out at a nursing-home. this student could of not like to be around old people. now he would be able to see that the elders are not that bad. 
5796	The development of a new, self-driving car that functions efficiently is being tested by various different companies, like Google and General Motors, but what practical purpose would this development solve? Some argue that these smart cars would increase traffic efficiency and could facilitate a new age of safe motor vehicles. Others argue that we cannot place our trust regarding safety solely in a machine. 
5797	The creation of driverless cars should not be further developed, despite potential increase in safety, due to the increased dependency on technology it would facilitate, as well as liability issues regarding crashes or other potential accidents, both of which could negatively impact other aspects of the future.  
5798	"Despite the issues of liability and dependency on technology, the development of new cars could potentially reduce safety risks associated with full human control over vehicles. Because ""the information from the sensors [of the driverless cars] can cause the car to apply brakes... allow a far better response and control than a human could manage,"" driverless cars may reduce potential for crashes of other incidents. Advanced sensor technology is indeed an asset to this new development "
5799	"however taking this concept while maintaining human control could prove to be more benenficial, due to the lack of issues such as liability and also keeping humans active and engaged. The problem is that most people would nate place full trust in technology, thus eliminating the purpose of a ""driverless car"" being completely driverless. Ultimately, this potential asset is far outweighed by the costs of producing driverless cars. "
5800	Younger generations of people in our modern world are becoming increasingly attuned to smart technology,with developments such as the smartphone, smart watch, etc. spreading throughout the nation. The introduction of a driverless car would further stimulate this already existing dependency, which could lead to problems down the road. 
5801	"As of right now, ""...none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless."" This means that someone must always be in the driver seat to ensure safety when the situation requires them to take over. This, however, contradicts the purpose of the ""driverless car."" In addition, because the point of these cars is to drive safely without human control, people could have this in mind while in a driverless car. As a result they may give little regard to the road, and rely on the car to keep them safe and get them to their destination. Then, if they are not prepared for an alert or a need for human assistance, because they expected the car to handle it, their dependency on the car put their safety at risk. "
5802	"The liability issues if such an accident were to occur could be tremendous. If there was an accident, the question would arise, "" who is at fault- the driver or the manufacturer?"" "
5803	"This could lead to court trials and lawsuits that would either harm the consumers in the auto industry, or the producers. Either way, the costs would have an increasingly negative impact on the economy. It would not be logical to assume that these cars would be one hundred percent safe, as there is alway room for error, and ""presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver..."" Because many people refuse to place full trust in technology that could have potential flaws, if an accident were to occur, the industry of self-driving cars would likely crash, as people would more and more see this technology as danger, and place the blame on the auto industry. "
5804	If further developments were to be made so that these cars truly don't need a driver, while it may reduce safety risks, ultimately the costs regarding user dependency and liability would outweigh benefits. Increased dependency could actually create more safetly problems, and liability issues could result is a crash of the auto industry's smart technology branch. If the concept of this Driverless car were changed to, rather than have no driver, help the driver, then the outcome may be more beneficial. If people still drove the car, but with helpful alerts, warnings, or displays, traffic safety would go up, and the liability and dependency issues would be lessened or dissolved altogether. A new age of technological innovation is here, and utilizing this idea in this moderate waycould pave the road to a brighter future. 
5805	but they could also fail at any time and turn into a bad situation. 
5806	However it could be a good idea to always add safety things to the car, 
5807	It is not a great idea If you let a car do everything for you because that could be dangerous. 
5808	"In conclusion, the Electorial College needs to be replaced with a more fair, balanced system. It has the potential to allow the electors to defy the will of the people who voted them in, invalidating the people's votes and making them pointless. It also has candates only focusing their ads and visits on the states with more votes and the states biased towards their party. Finally, it has almost all the states have a landslide ""winner-takes_all"" style of awarding electorial votes. This means if one side of electors only wins by a slim margin, the other side gets nothing, even though since they lost by a small number they clearly have a sizeable amount of voters for them. The Electorial College needs to be removed before someone takes advantage of it's serious flaws and takes the votes of the people and makes them useless.    "
5809	To conclude, Electoral College should continue to decide the president rather than popular votes becuase Electoral College avoids run-off elections, and Electoral College is more fair than popular votes. Why should we change the way we elect president if this method has been working for over 200 years? Electoral College should continue to decide the presidency for years to come because it works so well. That's why Electoral College will stay as the way to elect the president. 
5810	Changing the electoral college would not be an great idea due to the fact that it has been around for centuries and would negatively impact the voting system. Some believe the voting system is a very unfair and outdated system because of the electoral college. When changing the system to popular vote it will affect many people, it may also come out worse than the electoral college. 
5811	The landform on Mars is quite interesting, and there could be many thoughts on how it came to be. With already known knowledge and knowledge that is soon to come, people like to guess 
5812	Like Earth, Mars is a planet just with different features. Our earth forms mountains and hills due to erosion and our plate tectonics. It's naturaly formed by the planet. No living organism created the rocky mountains 
5813	Earth, unlike Mars, has an atmosphere. It keeps in heat, but changes. Earth also has water and life. If this were to be a cause of the rocks, hills, and mountains, then it could be said that the face on Mars was not created by erosion, water, or anything like that 
5814	My first reason is we can talk to our parents. If you let your parents know your lunch time during the day, they can call or text with information you may need. 
5815	A second reason is that it does not disturb or harass or learning environment, so why shouldn't it be aloud? 
5816	Lastly, it is a way to chat with friends at other schools who are also at lunch. In this time period, cell phones are a major way to keep in contact with those who do not live in the same state or town as you. 
5817	What do we do if an after school activity is canceled and we don't have a ride home? Are they supposed to walk home and freeze? During lunch we can let our parents know that our after school activity has been canceled and instead of walking home they can pick us up. Also, we can let our parents know what time our lunch is so they can call or text us if they need to let us know our pick up spot has changed or if they might be a little late picking us up from school 
5818	Letting us have cell phone during lunch could turn out to be very beneficial for parents and students. 
5819	Cell phones do not make any difference in a lunch time setting. They do not disturb anyone around us, and they do not harass the learning environment. 
5820	How do we talk to people who live in other towns or go to another school? Most teens will call or text them from a cell phone. If a friend from another school or town is at lunch at the same time as you, it is a good time to text them and have a small chat. 
5821	A teenagers social life is very important to them. Facebook, Twitter, and cell phones are the number one way we keep in contact with each other. Giving us time during our day to talk to eachother and keep in contact is very important to us. We know that during class is not the time, so if you give us time during lunch to chat we would also be quieter during classes, which would make our teachers happier.  
5822	In conclusion, kids need time to talk. Giving us that time during the day could not only help you but it could help us. We could talk to our parents and solve small problems. We could enjoy our free time a little bit more. Finally, we could talk to other friends and just have a good time in general. That is why i think the cell phone policy should change so we can use our cell phones during class and free times. 
5823	I believe that the way our elections are run are not what is best for the United States. The Electoral College is changing the way that we originally set out to vote and is making things unfair for the citizens who vote. 
5824	I propose that the Electoral College is taken away all together in order for elections to be more fair, and more like the original intention of the U.S. 
5825	With most states following the winner takes all idea, the winner of the general public may not be the candidate that wins the elections. These times are rare, but they happened before there is nothing that is stopping them from happening again. 
5826	A lot of voters who are not very well educated may not even understand what the electoral college is or what they are actually voting for when they vote. Instead of voting for the candidate that they want as the next president, they are voting for a group of electors that decide who will win. Sometimes, the electors that are assigned to that candiadate will not vote for them. This process also seems to disriciminate against the less populated states because they don't have as much a say in the college and are often forgoten in the rush of propaganda and aren't really aware of who they should pick and why they should pick them. 
5827	In The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong by Bradfor Plumer, Plumer explains that one of the best arguments against the Electoral College is that the rate of disaster is so high. In 2000, there was a elctoral crisis based upoun the Electoral College, because Al Gore recieved more individual votes, but George W. Bush still won the election. 
5828	Another reason that this process is so unstable is the way that it makes voters feel about voting 
5829	In large states, where this a majority of either republican or democrats, voters may think that if they are in the minority, and the other party will surely win the election, what's the point of voting. If there was no Electoral College, the votes that they put in could contribute to the greater pool of that parties voters, while with Electoral College the votes are pointless and basically disapear. That, to me, is robbing the citizens of the U.S. of thir right to vote. According to Richard A. Posner, the Electoral College restores some of the weight that the large states hold in a presidental election. However, the large states may not have all of one party and those other votes can really make a difference. 
5830	It seems unfair that the president of the United States, the most important man in the country, is not truely picked by the voters, but by the Elctoral College. The Office of the Federal Register says that the electors that are selected are chosen by the candidates political party but that stae laws differ on how they are specifically selected. This way does not seem like the best way of performing the task and I can see how it results in issues. Trusting the weight of the United Stated on the the backs iof only 538 electors is not the most stable way to perform an election. Why trust a select group with this descion if the whole United States can contribute to it 
5831	I think that it is criticall that we change the idea of an Electoral College to the idea that all of the people in the United States are able to contribute equally to who should be the next president based on what they believe is right 
5832	Bradford Plummer believes that one of the most worrying thoughts is that there will be a tie with the electors. If that were to occur the elction would fall into the hands of the House of Representitives, resulting in all the states, no matter what their population is, having the same amount of votes, casuing a president that may be very far away than what the majority of the United States actually wants. This may seem unlikely but in fact there have already been many close calls. In 1968, only 41,971 votes would have deadlockes the election. In 1976 a tie would have happened if 5,559 voters in Hawaii, and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted the other way (The Indefensibel Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong, by Bradofrd Plummer.) A tie may occur and if it does, A lot of citizens would be very upset that the president did not win by popularity, but by the Electoral College. 
5833	There are many reasons that the Elctoral College is unfair to the voters of the U.S. State inequality, diaster, ties, and people loosing the urge to vote. The list goes on and on and if this doesn't make you see what is wrong with this system than I don't know what will. I hope you take this information to good use and use it to tear down this unfair system once and for all. If we really want to be a democracy, than we have to do away with this system. Many of Americans believe that this is the best way and several have published interesting papers on that topic that may chaneg the minds of people who are still for it. I hope this dream to get rid of the unfair and terrible system that is the Electoral College is accomplished soon. 
5834	I completely disagree with your proposed policy change that if passed would not allow students to participate in sports or other activities unless they have a B minimum average. This policy would be unfair to students. 
5835	It is unacceptable because sports or other activities besides academics are valuable to students. 
5836	Non-academic activities are important in school because children need to be stimulated in all areas, not just academics. 
5837	Non-academic activities are also required because those activities can help improve students' performance in academics. 
5838	Overall, Principal, you cannot put this policy in place. It would contradict the purpose of school, and it may degrade the academic performance of students. 
5839	i think that everyone should be required to do community service at least once a week. 
5840	i believe that with at least one day that each student does it, it will help the school and our community. 
5841	If you approve of this our school will become cleaner and our library will become more organized and the kids from the elementary school would really appreciate if we could lend them a hand. If we all could participate in this program our student will think twice about throwing a piece of wrapper on the floor. 
5842	Most student disagree with me because they say that it isn't their responsibility to pick up after someone else. 
5843	They also say that they don't get anything out of performing community service 
5844	but i think that if each student does community service that maybe we could raffle a prize out every month or so, so that they could get motivated to do the service. 
5845	The driverless cars, aren't even close to driving themselves, they still need to have the driver's attention 
5846	"Driverless cars, should be as the title states, cars that are driverless. These cars, will give you warnings when it is going to need you to take control again. The author states, ""In fact, none of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when theroad ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" If these cars were really driverless, they wouldn't need a driver to help them navigate. Are these cars really driverless? No. "
5847	This process should be abolished as soon as possible for it is corrosive to the American peoples opinon. We should instead switch to a popular vote by eligble American citizens to decide presidency.  
5848	Now some fellows might argue that the Electoral College is favored by the people. 
5849	"When in fact, as Bradford Plumer points out in paragraph 9, ""60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now"". "
5850	Some people may also say that the Electoral college ecourages the president to visit all states, 
5851	when in fact smaller states still are not treated the same as states with more electoral votes. 
5852	A president would rather spend their time investing and giving information to a state such as Californa who have 55 electoral votes, who feel more inclined to think about their decision due to their involvement, rather than a state with 3 electoral votes who dont invest as much thought into their votes. 
5853	If your princible wanted to figure out what color the students wanted their yearbooks, she would not elect people to decide for each class! In the Bush and Gore election, Bush recived less votes by the American people but won presidency because he accuired more Electoral votes than Gore. That means that more American people wanted Gore, but the fate was chosen by 271 people, who selected Bush as the winner! 
5854	The Electoral College also increases the risk of a tie 
5855	if one occured, the election would be disrupted by the unorderly process of which we would have to take to decide the president. In 1968, a change of votes from just 41,971 people would have tied the electoral votes due to the even number of 538 Electors. 
5856	because we don't want to live in a dirty community. We also don't want viruses. If we keep this community clean then maybe a lot of people won't be sick and live longer. 
5857	We should also have more tutors because we want the kids to have a better life and not be poor in the streets. 
5858	The environment helps us by giving us air to breathe i think it's time to give back to the earth. Yes, it might take too much time away but we are doing it for a good reason and it is to live in a healthier, better community. They could do all they want during the weekends but it is better to help now while we can than to later on when we can't do anything about it. Also people that have asthma would help clean up the community because they don't want to get another asthma attack because people are polluting the air. If some people don't want to do community service that's fine because sooner or later they will regret it. We want people that have some kind of sickness to go outside and enjoy themselves. Most people that are sick or have heart conditions have to stay inside their home because it's too dangerous for them to go outside because we don't help keep the community clean and they might get an infection. When we go to school we should clean up after ourselves. Since people don't do that i think that they should do community service. I know everybody could do something even though if it's little it can still help out the community. 
5859	Just incase more people choose to not do community service I think that the people who do want to do community service should still have a chance to help out. 
5860	Someday someone might thank them for helping out. I think people who are sick would really appreciate what we are trying to do for them. Also pets could catch diseases that are in the air. When we leave food behind it creates maggots and maggots find a way to get into your house and when you at least expect it somehow they will end up in your body and start eating your flesh that's why we have to pick up after ourselves. Also when we go to school some people leave the food on the tables and it creates flies and mouse's and we don't want to a cafeteria that has animals that are infected with rabies or some other diseases. And I think that's why we should have community service. 
5861	they will be able to create a more personalized education, 
5862	allow for more free time to explore things outside of the academic world 
5863	the change in environment will lead to a better mental health for these students. 
5864	One of the biggest benefits of online school is that it lets students work at their own pace rather than having them stay on pace with everyone else 
5865	This allows for the kids to get a personalized education that fits best with how they learn. If one kid needs more practice, they are able to practice while another kid may be ready to move onto the next. This way the one that is moving on isn't being held back by the kid who might want a little more time on a unit or topic. Students create their own education plan which is also good for the teacher because sometimes it may not be easy, in a classroom setting, to spot when a kid needs a little more attention and work on a topic because they have to move as a group to finish all the units before a final or AP exam. Personalized education through online classes would allow for kids to finish everything before these exams but still learn the way they see best fit. 
5866	Because students are able to work at their own pace, they also are given more free time than in school education accounts for. 
5867	This free time is also beneficial to students as it is an opportunity for them to explore career choices and other things that interest them. Free time gives these students a chance to be involved in the community more through different things such as volunteering, having a job, working for an internship, and so much more. For example, one online student I know likes to volunteer at the animal shelter when she can because she wants to become a veterinarian. Her free time allows for her to learn more information and develop the skills for what she wants in the future. It sets kids up for success rather than failure by allowing them to find interests in high school rather than switching subjects every year in college. This free time lets them create a more lasting impact on their community while also finding out more about the real world and what it hold for students when they graduate. 
5868	Mental health is one of the biggest issues for teenagers in today's society. Many students feel trapped in school where they have nowhere to go and malice is inevitable. Students feel stressed, anxious, and depressed from traditional school which leads to their mental health deteriorating. But through online school, students will have a more open environment where they choose who is in and out of their life, so they are no longer forced to be around the people that hurt their mental health. It will decrease in mental health issues but it also allows for more time to be spent with the people they love and care about, which in turn builds their mental health up. Schools force kids to be with one another even if the none of them want to be there. Online school solves this by letting kids have more freedom with the social aspect of their life and do what they feel is best for their mental health. 
5869	Do you want a messed up system to control who is voted for president, or would you want to vote for who becomes president? In my favor, I would choose the most popular vote for president. In my defense people should vote for president and not have higher ranked people vote for president. To be clear with you, 
5870	I understand how you feel about community service, and I too agree it is very important. But some students have things to do like baby-sit for their parents or extra- curricular activities and sports. 
5871	I do not think community service should be required but it can be an extra-curricular activity 
5872	I also think it could be a punishment for students who misbehave 
5873	And students who choose not to pick up trash on their free time shouldn't have to be forced to did it 
5874	If they want to pick up trash, it should be because they want to and not because they have to 
5875	To me the country has it all wrong, I think we as US citizens should let our votes decide on who should be president. Even though things may get done quicker I think everyones voice should be heard. 
5876	"Like the example in ""whats wrong with the electoral college"" it saiys that ""if someone lived in Texas and they wanted to vote for John Kerry you'd vote for a slate of 34 democratic electors pledged to John Kerry and then John Kerry would have 34 electoral votes.""  If it were based on popular vote the points would be split to the person based on the number of votes they got. "
5877	"The ""winner-take-all"" method happens in swing states like Florida,us and other states have a big part on who we choose to run our country we usually pay attention to all the debates and campaings because we think our leader should know what he's doing swing states and big states are places a presidential campaign would take place the like to ensure they get their votes where it counts to guarentee a lead. "
5878	I think that it would be a nice change to help students get better grades. 
5879	It would also help our school to be a better, smarter school 
5880	Students would also push themselves so they won't have to face being kicked off their team.  
5881	If you change the policy then many students will be willing to push themselves for better grades so they can participate in school activities. 
5882	The students who are very dedicated to the sport or activity that they love would definitely push themselves for better grades. I believe that some of the students who participate in the activities at our school do not have a B average. Most likely because they are so dedicated to their sport that they forget about the schoolwork. If one of these students found out that you are changing the rule then they would change their attitude towards school so that they will not get kicked off their team.  
5883	Our school would be a smarted school if all the students participating in school activities all had B averages 
5884	There are a lot of students in our school's activities so if all of them had at least a B average that would be very impressive. We would not only be smart but look smart to other schools. Parent would want to send their children to out school. That would be pretty awesome. 
5885	Society is no longer in the era of the stereotypical paper and pencil. New advancements in technology offer a wide variety of options for a student's education. With internet, there are limitless opportunities as far as how and where a student needs to be in order to get a proper education. Home-schooling is a new trend that is gaining more popularity throughout the world each and every day. Other than the people that would be in a school, this system provides the students with all of the necessities that a student would have access to as if they were in a school. 
5886	Although some may believe home-schooling is a superior alternative, the motivation and socialization that would be present in a classroom would be nonexistent at home. 
5887	Motivation is a trait that many young adults need more of, whether it is waking up on time for class, or not procrastinating on a school project. Waking up early is something nearly everyone will have to do in their lifetime, so it is better to get used to it while you're still young. 
5888	If a student has been home-schooled their whole adolescent life, waking up early will be something that they struggle with as an adult. Procrastination is something that many students have a hard time avoiding during the school year. The root of procrastination is a lack of motivation. Part of a teacher's job is to keep the students on task and make sure that they are completing everything in a timely manner. Home-schooled students do not have the availability of a teacher to motivate them and make sure that they are doing their work. It is all up to them if they want to stay on task or fall behind. If no one is there telling the students what to do, they will struggle to find the motivation within themselves. As well as teachers, peers also help to encourage their fellow classmates to stay focused. This leads into the next topic of socialization. 
5889	High school is a period in one's life where they should enjoy their youthfulness while still working hard in school. It is important to balance the two out as they are equally as important. 
5890	A school is the central point of socialization, whether it is working together to complete an assignment, or just conversing during your lunch break. Many long lasting relationships are established within a school environment. Home-schooled students cannot relate to in-school students in this sense. Not only is it important to form friendships, but it is also important to get comfortable around large crowds of people. Talking to people is an inevitable fate in everyone's life, this might be giving a presentation at work or publicly speaking in college. While it is a burden to most, starting earlier in life will provide more confidence for when you need it later in life. 
5891	Students might get anxious around a large crowd for many reasons. For one, self conscious people might get anxious because they think that people are judging them for their appearance. Others might have a hard time building up enough confidence to voice their opinion in front of numerous people. 
5892	While home-schooling would eliminate the fear of social anxiety, I believe that it is better to face it and get used to it, rather than hide from it. 
5893	Another reason to argue for home-schooling is because of reduced stress. Some may say that the levels of stress will be greatly reduced in the comfort of home without the constant distraction of other students and the demands placed on students by teachers. While this partially might be true, more stress is caused when a student does not know how to manage their time wisely. Home-schooled students are at a greater risk for this because their are also many distractions at home such as cell phones and social media. 
5894	Many things are taught in school other than just math, science, history, and language arts. School teaches many important life values that teens will need for when they are an independent adult. Some of these values are impossible for home-schooled students to learn, simply because it is a different environment. Although the idea of home-schooling sounds like the most beneficial option, many people do not realize that home-schooled students have to face their own type of challenges that they will have to overcome. For these reasons I cannot stand for home-schooling. In this case, I will admit that old school beats new school. 
5895	Extra community service has the possibility of being a new way of punishment for students who misbehave. 
5896	Mandatory community service would be a great way to aid other people.  
5897	I personally think that the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. 
5898	Imagine, not being able to play in the biggest basketball game of your life because your grades were not as good as the principal would expect them to be 
5899	I find it very unfair that students are not allowed to participate in school sports or other activities with a C average. 
5900	not allowing the students to play in the game may cause the team to lose an important game 
5901	In Red Silver, New Jersey, RELATIVE_NAME, who was very good at basketball was unable to play in the championship game because his grades weren't that well. As the game was close come to the fourth quarter,  RELATIVE_NAMEs team couldn't hold onto the game. RELATIVE_NAME was averaging 22.9 points a game, 12 rebounds, and 10 assists, and those statistics in the championship could've made his team possibly win as they lost by 20 points. RELATIVE_NAME missed being eligible for the game by one point in his average.  His average was an 82, which is a C, and  B average is an 83. RELATIVE_NAME missing the championship game affected his team for the worst, as the Red  Silver could've won its first basketball championship ever.  
5902	"RELATIVE_NAME, tall and corpulent, was very good at football, yet not a great student. RELATIVE_NAME was being scouted by Division1 scouts from colleges such as Florida. Being a C+ student was his only fear from making the ""big colleges"" in the nation. In Maui, RELATIVE_NAME dominated the football season. Unfortunately, he was forced to sit out of the biggest game in his career because he was not academically eligible. RELATIVE_NAME was affected so greatly on this incident, all of his Division1 scholarships were gone because the scouts didn't want a student like RELATIVE_NAME in the school. RELATIVE_NAME was not very intelligent, but if he was to have someone tutor him, he would've went to any college he wanted to go to.  "
5903	i think that maintaining a C average to play on the school sports team or other activities the school offers. RELATIVE_NAME and RELATIVE_NAME  both were affected off of this negatively as they could have had potential in going far in life. So in my opinion, i think that the principal should let students participate in school sports, as long as they get help in the subjects they are struggling in. 
5904	I am writing this letter to inform you that requiring all students to perform community service is a great idea 
5905	"The students who don't like it say ""it takes too much time away from what they need or want to do"" "
5906	but in truth these are the lazy failing students that don't want to do anything in life. 
5907	Even so there are students who would love the idea and would go for it. 
5908	Not only do the cut down on fuel usage, 
5909	also reduce the number of accidents. 
5910	The futuristic automobiles could revolutionize the country. Drivereless cars are a fantastic idea, and could create several benifits for the country.  
5911	Driverless cars have the potentiol to drastically reduce fuel usage. 
5912	The driverless cars, that are largely computer powered, leave very little room for human error, which would drastically reduce the number of automobile accidents.  
5913	Oppontens of driverless cars may argue that these cars are not safe in the event of unforseen circumstances, such as accidents or road problems. 
5914	"However, driverless cars, as stated in the article, ""are designed to to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skill."" Thus, in an emergancy situation, the driver can take over the car can advance past the situation and continue to move along without any issue.  "
5915	Now the fact is that the electoral college works well for our country, but when the population that is voting for president is actually voting for a candidate to vote for their state, that is lying to the voters and is morally wrong. We cannot lie to the population and be a strong country at the same time. We want to vote for our country's leaders not have someone else vote for us. 
5916	We have gone on long enough with the electoral college, it is outdated and inefficient. 
5917	At one point, I believed the electoral college was a bad idea. Although, after reading this, my view on the matter as changed dramatically. 
5918	The electoral college keeps a balance in a country, a balance very much needed. I agree with it one hundred percent. 
5919	The electoral college was established as a compromise between election of the President by congress, and election of the President by popular citizen vote. The founding fathers felt it would given congress too much power if it elected the President all by itself. They also felt if citizens chose the seat by themsleves there wouod be chaos. They decided on a nice in between; they both choose, well sort of. What many citizens do not know is that when they cast their vote, they are not voting for the president, but for a slate of electors who in turn elect the President. 
5920	The problem with citizens voting diectly for the president can be broken into two categories: uncertinty 
5921	If the vote were solely based on citizen votes, the statisitcal outcome of the event would be crazy. With the majority of the electoral college applying the winner take all approach, it cuts those numbers down incredibly. It is allot easier to confirm a winner out of 538 votes then it is  to confirm one out of hundreds of millions of votes now isn,t it?  
5922	Many people think for themselves and only themselves. They are not qualified to make choices for the sake of the whole country, that is where the electors come in. These are people chosen by state conventions, state party committees, and sometimes candidates themselves. They hear the ideas of the people and manage them so that they are able to help everyone. They are pro politicians whose job in life is to preserve our country  
5923	"The U.S government lets people choose these electors so they feel important in the choices our country makes. We take time to study our favorite candidates, and if the electoral college does not agree with them, they are pushed to the side. What happens to the people who did not vote for the, ""right"" candidate? They are forever unheard. Sentenced to live in a community where they are silcenced. I do not agree with the electoral college because agree with our fore father Abraham Lincoln. He said this was supposed to be a country of the people, by the people, and for the people.  "
5924	You are wrong in so many levels sir. the electoral college does not exclude democracy, it promotes it! 
5925	Every citizen of legal age uses their god given right to express their political preference in the hopes of improving our country. The electoral college prevents regional rulership over areas that prefer one political side. It re-elects every four years to let everyone know, though your thoughts may not have been used in these past times, know that they have surely been heard. 
5926	I think community service should be something everyone does to help others, or to help the Earth. 
5927	when the air is polluted, and more people get sick per week or day from it, it is time to start cleaning up are community 
5928	I think the help of the elementary kids would be great for them, so they can get work done, and not just have to ask the teacher for help, but they can ask their tutor also. 
5929	they can go home after school, and have no work with a tutors help. The tutor would feel good at the end since the student they helped enjoyed the help of the work, and also enjoy meeting someone new to them. 
5930	The community need to be cleaned up so our air pollution can get better than what it is right now. 
5931	We should have a couple kids clean up places during study hall hours, and after school. Also, the lakes, rivers, and oceans are getting polluted from all the junk in the water. So all the fish, turtles, and other sea creatures are dying from the pollution thrown onto the ground, which can get blown into the water, or thrown into the water. I think we should have kids recycle paper and other recyclable items to reuse them, instead of cutting down trees for the paper, and make the new items. 
5932	The schools should have a Recycling competition where the Study hall class that brings in the most items to be recycled, 
5933	get a free day party for the study hall the whole week. The competition goes on each month. After each month, they have an assembly to get all the items collected, then they put them together to see how much they recycled that month. It would encourage kids to recycle more often, and give a little bit of a competition for the school. 
5934	If we didn't have community service, our community and planet would be a wreck. We need more people to help for community service so it can go by faster each day, and makes others feel good about where they live. If we didn't have community service, you would mostly be walking on trash every step you take, since some people throw their trash on the floor instead of a trash or dumpster. 
5935	Some people dislike community service since they like to be inside the whole day either in front of a television, on a computer, or playing a video game. So they think community service is boring and not worth their time, 
5936	but they need to learn that they can save the environment by just picking up a wrapper on the ground, and spending time away from the electronics, and go outside with friends, or pick up trash in their neighborhood. 
5937	The people that do community service, should be proud of what they do to help others, and keep up the work they do. 
5938	So I think all students should perform community service so we have an excellent environment, and more people can look at teens, and not think of them as a bad reputation like adults do right now. They think of some teens as trouble, bratty, and they don't do anything. But other teens are getting looked up to by doing different amounts of work to help out, and also adults think they are a good reputation since they help out more. 
5939	I think that raising the required grade for sports from a C to a B will inspire students to work harder for their grades and since they won't be distracted by sports it will be much more achievable. 
5940	I think this may be difficult for some students so you should offer some sort of help to get them on track. 
5941	You could offer an after school study hall or even have other students tutor them. Anything that could help get them going would be great. I'm in sports myself and i love them and can tell you if I was prohibited from them because of my grades I would immediately try to find help or work as hard as i could to bring them back up. 
5942	Again, I think that if they can't try in school they should' t be allowed to try in sports. If they aren't getting bad grades from lack of trying though that where the help should be offered. I just think that sports are important too and if they bring their grade up they can enjoy sports and grades all the more. 
5943	"""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-takes-all system in each state, candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states."" "
5944	Many people believe that giving students the opportunity to take their classes online would not be beneficial and by doing so, schools would be decreasing the likelihood of productivity in their students. 
5945	taking classes online could be tremendously beneficial in the daily life of a student, 
5946	by helping them feel more comfortable 
5947	helping them have the ability to attend while sick 
5948	even by helping them have better access to projects and other assignments that could have easily been forgotten in their home if they did not attend online classes. 
5949	For example, everyone knows that feeling of coming home after a long day of work or school. That imaginary switch that immediately turns on in ones brain once they finally step into their home, telling them they can now relax, take off their shoes and do what they want at their own desired pace. Now, imagine if people of all ages, still attending school today could feel completely at ease even while they learn in class, but this time through video conferences. 
5950	By taking online courses in the comfort of their own home, students can benefit by feeling more eager to ask all the questions they need to and not feel embarrassed nor, worry about others giving them strange looks. 
5951	Students would also have the ability to sit or adjust space for themselves once their lesson starts. From my own experience in school, I have heard many students complain about how uncomfortable the chairs are and how people keep kicking their seats and so forth. This can be a very big distraction for many students. The amount of discomfort they experience, while they are trying to focus can distract their learning and even cause them to have pains once they return home. 
5952	Waking up early for school is already a hassle for many students and being sick, while having to wake up early could make the student have a much harder time. All a student wants to do is lay in bed and get better soon, but a lot of students often worry about all the work that will be piled up on them once they return to school, making them force themselves to attend. If students do this, it can lead to even worse issues, such as having an unwanted accident at school or even spreading the sickness to multiple other students. Video conferencing can help students stay on track with their work and also help them have better access to their medication when it needs to be taken. Students would not have to deal with unneeded stress from school and could calmly focus their energy on bettering their health. 
5953	There are a few unfortunate moments in a students day to day life where they stay up late working hard on an assignment that they end up forgetting on their desk, bed, dinner table or anywhere else that is not their backpack. Forgetting to turn in work can hugely affect a students grade, but with the help of online courses, a student can have easy access to their projects and assignments without having to worry about their grade dropping over a simple misplacement. They can have the opportunity to easily locate it and have it by their side once their teacher does any kind of review where the student can also keep up and ask questions, instead of looking around the classroom or peeking at someones paper. Also, if students were to have access to their homework and other important projects at all times they are most likely to work on it until, they are able to complete it due to their conscience reminding them that there is work to be done and that the student had a lot more time to finish it. 
5954	Take many college students for example, some of them take online versions of their classes from home and they are still able to excel to their full potential. By watching lessons online, the students will most likely receive a much better understanding and visual representation of their teachers examples, since their attention will be focused only on what is being shown to them and not around the classroom. Additionally, Students that go to school already work on projects and assignments at home regularly without getting distracted, so taking online classes would be no different than regular school. A student that is determined and knows the importance of paying attention in school would try their best, whether they take online classes or normal classes.  
5955	To sum up, giving students the chance to have distance learning as an option for them is extremely beneficial in many ways. Not only can a student attend classes more often than usual, but they can also get the chance to learn more and keep up with assignments that could have piled up as their absences increased. Online learning can help a student break out of their shell and talk to their teacher more about their questions and get a more in depth experience in an online classroom. Therefore, these are the reasons why students all around could benefit from this great opportunity.       
5956	economy dropping, 
5957	the inability to drive those cars specifically, 
5958	several legal issues to think about. 
5959	Many people make their living off selling cars, advertising cars, building cars, designing cars, and even workers for car companies like Subaru, Toyota, Ford, Chevy, and more. On the radio, drivers hear tons of car sales and ads. If all the companies, all the advertisements, all the sales, all the new disigns, and every last car builder were to have to cope with driverless cars, many citizens would be out of a job. 
5960	The job market for cars would collapse and so would the economy leaving thousands unemployed. 
5961	Also, gas and oil would no longer have anywhere near as much value as it does now. Without oil and gas prices, even more poeple would be without jobs. Not to mention taxes would be brought up on everything else to try and keep the economy stable, but in reality, the rise in taxes would make everyone but the government looking for loose change. Especially people who have more importants things to pay for, like children and disabili 
5962	The inability to operate the cars would be even more an issue for people wiht disabilities 
5963	Along with the dovelopment of new cars, there would be NEED to be new laws to go with them. 
5964	Economy build up, people out of jobs, kids taking cars, disability mobility, legal documents, could all be avioded if the risk wasnt taken to make these driveless cars. They might be ffacinating and new now, but will it be worth it when the economy falls apart, when you lose your child, or get badly injured? Keep driverless cars off the road and keep moving forward in a REAL car to stay safe. 
5965	they can eliminate factors that can lead to humans crashing 
5966	they will make transportation easier for the standard person.  
5967	The computers that run the automated cars will not get fatigued, while many people fall asleep at the wheel and can kill others or themselves. Also, these cars will not be affected by emotions such as anger at other drivers, which can lead to aggressive driving and mistakes on the road. Plus, the cars will be able to see almost as much as their human counterparts as long as their radars, such as the LIDAR, are powerful and accurate enough to send an accurate reading back to the computerized vehicle. This will hopefully mean that the driverless cars will crash less because of factors such as emotions and fatigue.  
5968	The driverless cars would be more practical for some people because, if they can completely drive themselves, the passengers would not need a liscence or insurance like they would if they were driving the car themselves. However, the car would perform the same duties as a car they might own, unlike other forms of public-transportation. For example, busses cannot pick you up or drop you off at your home, so if the bus stop is not near to your house, it is not reasonable to ride the bus to work or other places. However, the taxi service would be able to pick you up no matter where you were. This would also be helpful if you were stranded somewhere and you needed help. 
5969	"Google's driverless cars ""have driven more than half a million miles without a crash."" This is an incredibly high mileage for never having a crash, and it shows that these cars are going to be incredibly safe when they are released to the public. Even thought the cars are still just being tested, they have never had a crash. Granted, the cars are not completely driverless, but the safety of the public is still the most important thing in the minds of many car manufacturing companies. These cars will prevent many people from being killed or injured in car accidents. "
5970	All in all, driverless cars are going to be something that will be incredibly helpful in the future. They help to reduce the factors that affect drivers, they will be more a very practical form of transportation, and they seem to be, in general, safer than other vehicles. The advances that have been made in the automobile industry in the last 100 years are truly worthy of our praise. We have come from incredibly basic cars to cars that can drive themselves, for at least some of the time. However, when you look at all the progress that we have made, it forces you to think about what we will come up with next. Maybe, flying cars are not that far away from being a reality. 
5971	When the Constitution of the United States was written our founding fathers decided on an Electoral College as the way to ellect the president instead of a direct vote. The Electoral College is a process that makes a compromise between the popular vote of the citizens and the Congressional vote. When citizens vote for president they are actually voting for a member of the Electoral College that is going to select their president, rather than the citizens voting for the president themselves. The Electoral College is made of 538 electors, the number of electors from each state varies depending on the states Congressional delegation. Washington D.C. is counted as a state for this process and alloted only three electors. 
5972	The electoral college should be kept in use 
5973	t simplifies the outcome 
5974	allocates more power to the larger states.  
5975	When voting with a popular vote system a debate over the outcome of the vote is very likely and will probably cause some constroversy. When the votes form the electoral college are counted the margin of victory is much higher which simplifies the result of the poll. During the election of 2012 Obama only recieved 51.3 percent of the vote, however he won the vote of the electoral college with an astounding 61.7 percent, a increase in the margin of victory by 10.4 percent. With this wide of a margin of victory a dispute over the victor of the presidential election is unlikely and  almost impossible to argue against. 
5976	Some might argue that the Electoral College is flawed because electors can choose not to vote for their canidate. It is true that this has happened in the past, 
5977	"""in 1960, segregationist in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded on replacing the Democratc electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy."" P.11. If this happened the popular vote for Kennedy would have gone to his adversaries instead. "
5978	It is true that electors can choose not to vote for the canidate they pledged to and that this has happened in the past however the electors rarely betray their party's nominee and a tie in the electoral vote is extreamly unelikely. 
5979	Additionally, the Electoral College sould be kept in today's democracy because is allocates power to the larger states 
5980	"It only makes sense that the larger states with a larger population should get more of a say in their government, and recieve more electoral votes than a small state with fewer people. With this system political infulence is restored to the larger states making the canidates focuss on the more populous areas. More power to the more populous states also means that run-off elections are avoided. In 1992 and in 1968 run-off elections were avoided due to the use of the Electoral College; ""Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority of the Electoral College"" P.22. A run-off election extreamly complicates the election process however the chance of this happening is greatly reduced when using the Electoral College which almost always produces a clear winner. "
5981	The electoral college should be kept in use because it simplifies the outcome and allocates more power to the larger states. The Electoral College avoids the outcome of a run-off election. It also greatly reduces the chance of a dispute between the victor. 
5982	Most people do not like the Electoral College because they are not directly voting for their canidate 
5983	however many people fail to realize hat it is rare for an elector to betray his nominee. Electors rarely betray their canidate because they are chosen by the canidates party or the canidate themself. 
5984	I believe the best decision is to change to an election by popular vote for the President of the United States. 
5985	If the system would change, people would feel like their votes actually matter more then they do now.  
5986	They wouldn't have to worry about the electors flipping sides. 
5987	To begin with, if the Electoral College was to be taken out of use, more people would feel like their vote matters. 
5988	"Although you may think you are voting for your choice of president, you are not.  As of now, when you cast your vote, you are actually just voting for your candidate's electors, as said in ""What Is the Electoral College"".  In the 2000 campaign, voters in seventeen states didn't have a chance to see the candidates at all.  Those candidates went mainly to the ""swing"" states, or states that were not certain on who they would be voting for.  The states unvisited, such as Rhode Island and South Carolina, were passed over because the candidates knew they would or wouldn't have their vote no matter what.  The ones who questioned their vote did not have the chance to see either candidate in their state.  In, ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"", the Romney and Obama election is mentioned.  It brings up the fact that Romney knew that throughout the South, he was going to get their vote.  He realized that there was no need to go there because he didn't need anymore popularity in the South because he had already gained their electoral votes.  Those who opposed Romney in the southern states felt that their votes would not matter because majority already knew they were voting for Romney.  If the system were to change, which I believe it should, more people would feel their votes mattered no matter what state they were in. "
5989	In addition to feeling like your vote matters, people never know if the electors would flip their desicions. 
5990	"The slate of electors is not picked by the people.  It is said in, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid jdefenses of the system are wrong"", that sometimes the state conventions, the party's central committee, or the presidential candidates themselves choose who will be their electors.  That being said, you don't know whether or not the electors will follow your choice of president or not.  For example, in 1960, some electors refused to vote for their party's candidate and they chose whomever they wanted. If we were to switch the way things are now, that would not happen.  A poll taken in 2000 called the Gallup poll, showed that over 60% of voters prefered a direct election rather then the kind we have now.  This took place when Al Gore recieved the popular vote, but lost the electoral votes.  You can see that the current system has its flaws.  "
5991	In conclusion, I strongly feel that we need to change to an election by popular vote.  Above all, it is more fair to the people.  Citizens would feel that their votes matter more than they do now.  People wouldn't have to be worried about if the electors would flip on what they had voted for.  Although some say its is absolutely fair throughout all the states, there are still the set backs that come along with keeping an Electoral College.  I agree with former presidents, Nixon and Carter, that we need to abolish the Electoral College.  All of these reasons show you the problems there are with the current system of electing our President and I know you will agree 
5992	These cars are the technology of the future. 
5993	Despite this product being a bit more of a want than a necessity for the time being 
5994	In the 1950s, General Motors created the first car that could drive without a human at the wheel. AT that time, it would have been difficult to believe that such technology of a car that could drive itself with no type of polarized track below it would have been possible. Three decades later in the 1980s, the first speed sensors had been placed in wheels in order to provide drivers with an heightened break accuracy. Not even ten years later, those same sensors had become so advanced as to now provide drivers with the added safety of a car who could respond to the danger of out-of-control skidding. Furthermore, by the 2000s, radars that at one point had costed millions, could be found in your regular old run-of-the-mill car for your local dealer ship, ready for the purchase of any regular civillian. 
5995	WIth all of this improvement in a car's safety and reliability, not only can countless lives be saved on the road with this technology, but the more it is improved upon, the less room there is for the common human error in driving, which unfortunately leads to thousands of lives being lost yearly to traffic accidents. 
5996	"While the current ""driverless"" cars still require some human skills when travelling through complex road conditions, with continuing developement, eventually the accuracy of the computers' driving skills will rival that of human intelligence. This can be predicted by looking at the accuracy and speed of reaction when looking at an automated calculator in comparison to a human arithmatic. As time has progress, so has technology up to the point where it surpasses human intelligence and reaction speed, and in the case of these new cars, would make it generally safer for the extremely accurate computers to do the driving, rather than humans, who would make a great many more faults when it comes to driving safely and accurately "
5997	"The only major issue that could arise is the problematic moment in which a ""driverless"" car's system would break. This would leave not only the passenger in the car in danger depending on the severity of the car failure, but it would also leave the other communters on the road in danger as well. "
5998	" In conclusion, if these ""driverless"" cars are allowed to continue to be tested and improved upon, countless lives will be saved and human efficiency will increase. As this fantastic technology is improved upon, the negative aspects of trial and error, restrictive laws, and cost will only decrease. As for the future, human culture as we know it will change to alot this new technological enhancement into our everday lives, and in the process, potentially save thousands of individuals with ever purchase of a new ""smart"" car. "
5999	Students should not be required to perform community service in order to pass a class or grade. Community service should not be a requirement, 
6000	because community service is only useful if the person does it with enthusiasm. Otherwise, it becomes a chore instead of a personal choice to do the right thing. 
6001	Also if somebody does, for example, cleaning up the beach as a community service project, they will likely miss trash and litter. This would be due to a lack of enthusiasm, and the person did not really contribute to society. So it is a lose-lose situation to be in, the kids complain that it eats up their time and the job does not get done. 
6002	"There is many solutions to getting students involved with community service. One, for example, is to give extra credit to those that CHOOSE to do community service. Another possible way is to promote using flyers in hope someone will look at it and say something like ""Hey, this beach really is messy, and I can help"". So "
6003	"Okay, to recap, no community service requirements, because to some kids it will be a ""chore"" and won't get done right. Community service is good, but if it is not required the job will get done right. There are other options than to require community service, such as promoting and extra credit. So you should listen so this letter so doing community service is a win-win situation. "
6004	With two types of states, swing states and big states, the candidate can get wrapped up in trying to get the most votes in one particular type of state,-typically big states- they dont notice how the oppisite type of state could benefit them in the long run. 
6005	because it lessens the time for extra curricular activities, 
6006	makes community service seem as it is work rather than something you chose to do 
6007	and because it takes time away from homework and other school work we are required to perform at home. 
6008	It's a common known fact that America has problems with obesity. Making kids do community service would definitely take time off of children's clock that they could be doing active activities like working out or playing a sport. This would increase obesity rates in America even more, causing the life span of children in this Country to shrink. 
6009	My second point is that forcing children to do community service makes it seem more like work, rather than if you didn't it would seem like something you do for fun, like a hobby. 
6010	Community service is something that should be done because kids want to help other kids, the environment or those who need help. This wouldn't only make the amount of work done plummet, but also the quality of the work. If a kid is performing community service and is really enjoying himself, he is much more likely going to get a lot done and it is going to be very good quality work.  
6011	My third, and final point is that forcing children to perform community service is taking time away from children's school work or studying at home. 
6012	There is no doubt that children in this very room that I'm writing this paper in are struggling to pass the 8th grade. Forcing them to do community service would only increase the number of failing students at SCHOOL_NAME. This would not only be problematic for the children that are failing, but would also hurt this schools' reputation of having good academic program. 
6013	In conclusion forcing children to perform community service would be problematic for three reasons, because it lessens the time for extra curricular activities, makes community service seem as it is work rather than something you chose to do and because it takes time away from homework and other school work we are required to perform at home.  
6014	Many students argue that community service is nothing that requires them, but many adults and some students feel it is an important part of our world, and it's an activity that everyone can participate in. 
6015	Everyone needs to help change the world, and I agree that community service is a big deed that students should be taking a part of, 
6016	a lot of students claim they don't have enough time. 
6017	Doing little things like walking your neighbors dog, or help babysit your cousins is enough for students who have extracurricular activities, and boat loads of homework. Many students do participate in community service, and many also do extracurricular activities. 
6018	The main reason students say that they cannot participate in community services is because they play sports, or are on the dance team, or in English festival. They participate in something extracurricular, therefore they don't have the time between games and practices to balance out there schedule and their grades. 
6019	The students grades are another important reason to either decide if or if you cannot participate in community services, let alone extracurricular activities. 
6020	Now, not all community services are giving away food to the homeless, it's a simple thing such as tutoring a younger student, or cleaning up the lunchroom so all the volunteers who prepared the lunch don't have another burden on their shoulders. 
6021	doesn't mean that they can't throw in a little extra time for the community. Go to study hall or try to get some of your work done in school, instead of talking. 
6022	Now my opinion is that all students should participate in some sort of community services and still be able to balance out there grades and conflicting schedules. Everyone needs to be flexible, and try to help out the community for a change. It should be required, and every student should be able to handle a little community services. Thank you for taking the time to read this. 
6023	Electing a new president of the United States of America has been, and always will be, a big deal. One could be a state senator, a member of the legislative branch, or even an average citizen with zero involvement in governmental jobs/issues. The one thing that ties all of these people together - is that they're all citizens. As citizens, these people will care about who is running their country, what plans they have for it, and how those plans are carried out. Therefore, on behalf of the U.S., it is important to elect the correct person to rule a nation and keep it safe. 
6024	The Electoral College is a flawed system used to elect presidents, and the American voting system should be based on popular vote 
6025	One of the things that is wired throughout all three sources, is that electoral votes basicallly overpower the votes of the average citizen. 
6026	"When the average citizen does vote, however, their vote does not go toward the president. Their vote goes to the Electoral College, who then vote for the president. ""[...] it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote"" (Posner 16). "
6027	the winner of an election can win without owning the popular votes of an entire nation. 
6028	"Basically, all that a candidate even needs is the majority votes of the Electoral College in order to win an election. ""[...] according to a Gallup pole in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore - thanks to the quirks of the electoral college - won the popular vote but lost the presidency[...]"" (Plumer 9). Collecting the votes of the Electoral College is the only concern of a candidate - therefore the only reason that candidates speak to the people is to influence them to cast votes for the Electoral College, which then cast votes for that candidate. ""[...] Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes [...]"" (Posner 18). It's as if the people are just physical steps that electoral voters use to get to the person that the Electoral college wants to be the president of the U.S.  ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always"" (Plumer 10). As mentioned in the article by Richard A. Posner, members of the Electoral College are chosen and expected to vote for their party's nominee. However, people don't always deliver what we expect from them. It is completly possible for an elector to change their mind, and cast their finalizing vote toward the opposite candidate. These members cast their votes directly to the candidate, and they can easily change their vote.                       "
6029	"""The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution "
6030	I believe that we shouldn't change the Electoral College for popular votes the way we arevoting now is working just fine and it makes it so larger states like Texas don't get more of an impact on the election because of thier population than smaller states like Rhode Island. Also the Electoral College prevents Run-off elections. Even though some believe the Electoral College as an anachronism I think that the Electoral College is still a good way of voting. 
6031	Even at the most basic level the electoral college is still unfair to voters because of the winner take all system put in place for each state 
6032	My friends father always complains about how the voting systems work here in the U.S. He believes that the electoral votes should not really matter. He strongly leans on the idea that candidates should win an election by the popular votes. Although the Electoral College has helped with many situations before, like the 2000 election, when Al Gore had the more popular votes then Bush yet, fewer electoral votes. 
6033	I'm started to believe that changing the electoral votes to popular votes would be better for elections of presidents.  
6034	Replacing the electoral college with popular votes would be better for elections of presidents because, it's the peoples choice. 
6035	For examlpe, people vote for the candidates that they more relate too and their choices. Having the electoral college around can make an impact to their choice. Say if a majority of a state vote for a candidate, but the state doesn't have enough electoral votes for that canididate to take a lead or win the election. How can they get there favorite candidate to win the election? The electoral college is blocking that way for that particular state. In brief, people need their say for their favorite candidate instead of the electoral college giving them points. 
6036	For instance, the states of california has many electoral points for candidate to win an election. I believe there are fifty-three for that states because they have many representatives. If the majority of the people in the state vote for a democrat or a republicin the electoral points goes to either one of them. Giving that candidate big points to even take a lead in the election 
6037	To wrap it up, the electoral college do have pros and cons in a election. The electoral college can give a candidate the election. But the popularity vote are for the people and by the people. I stiil stay towards to the idea that the popularity vote is a greater way for voting. Remember it does say We The People in the Declaration of Independence which was sighn by our founding fathes.    
6038	Recently it has come to my attention that there is some controversy over the potential community service requirement. Some students believe that community service is important and are very passionate about the work they are doing. However, other students think that community service will take away too much time from other things they participate in, which are of greater value to them. As you can see, both sides have valid points to make. 
6039	To solve the problem in a way that is pleasing to both sides, I propose to you a compromise. If a student keeps a grade average of an A, community service will be optional. If a student's grades fall below that, community service will be a requirement. 
6040	First, this solution addresses the wants of the first group. 
6041	They value community service greatly and think that everyone should pitch in. In the compromise, students with grades below an A average will be required to help. This is a fair number of people to help their cause. The A students have the option of community service, and I feel confident saying that many of the kids who already partake in community service have good grades. In this way, the first group has a large amount of students assisting the community. 
6042	The compromise I have volunteered also meets the needs of the other group 
6043	. If the kids that think community service will interfere with their schedule have A averages, then they will not need to do the community service. However, if their grades fall below that mark, they will need to participate. This ensures that the kids who do not do the community service are spending enough of their time on schoolwork. As the principal, motivating kids to achieve higher in school should appeal to you. 
6044	It has come to the attention of the student body that you are considering two possible plans of action to deal with the evident cell phone problem. 
6045	I will go ahead and start by telling you that taking away cell phones all together will only cause misery and sorrow for all. It is my suggestion and that of the school that you would allow us to have our phones available for use in our free time and lunch periods. 
6046	Of course they would be turned off in class as they should. There are so many reasons that we use phones as much as we do and taking them away will cause a tension like no other. The good outweighs the bad in this situation for many reasons and I am prepared to prove that. 
6047	The bottom line and one of the main reasons we should have our phones available for use is the connection. 
6048	Kids need to be connected and be able to interact with each other. It is simply part of being a growing person. We need that constant interaction to settle our nerves and keep us up on our friends lives. Obviously the class room is not the appropriate place or time for that. However, kids texting and talking in their own free time is completely acceptable. Connection is important to kids. Take it away and all is lost for us all. 
6049	As the day goes by and the homework piles up stress is immense to say the least. One of the great things about cell phones is that they are great at relieving stress 
6050	It may be one of the worst mistakes made by adults, thinking that taking away cell phones will solve all of their problems. It will only make kids made ,who will in turn make adults and teachers alike, miserable. If you haven't found out already, cell phones are actually for the benefit of all, even in a school environment. It will make life for teachers a breeze and likewise for kids. For all of these reasons and so many more I would ask you with the sincerity of my heart that you will please consider letting us use our cell phones in school.  
6051	Technology make the lives easier of millions of people.  It makes communication easier and more convenient.  People all over the world want to integrate technology into as many aspects of their lives as possible.  Schools are jump on this bandwagon by integrating online distance learning and video conferencing into their curriculum.  Some educators find this would enhance the education of students, because they can learn during most any circumstances, but some believe this would be much more challenging and inconvenient because of internet issues and the situation of students when are are absent from school. 
6052	Students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home through video conferencing and other forms of distance learning. 
6053	 When students are absent, they are absent for a reason, whether good or bad.  They are not able or willing to attend school, and they are not going to attend online classes from home.  
6054	A student who is too sick to attend school, needs to rest, and concentrate on getting better so they can attend school, not worry about the assignments they have to do or lessons they need to learn.  If school is canceled for inclement weather, many students might lose power or internet service and not be able to get work done.  Students who have to travel often due to highly competitive sports do not have time to work on assignments while at tournaments, games, and competitions, but coaches for clubs and travel programs have rules about the grades their athletes have to keep to be able to play and travel; this will keep athletes from getting far behind and from being unprepared on graded assignments on new subjects. It would not be beneficial for students to have virtual learning because, when students are not going to come to school they are not going to do school work.  
6055	 Technology often has problems and cannot be guaranteed to work and not every student does not has access to internet connection. 
6056	Technology, in some areas, does not work every day and sometimes cannot be used at all.  At Generic_School, there are countless days when the the internet is completely down and no electronic devices can be used.  Teachers who have planned to use technology for their lesson have to come up with something different to do, with no preparation time, which leads to misusing class time at the fault of the technology errors.  If a teacher assigns work over a weekend, while the school can provide a laptop, they cannot provide wifi and internet connection in the homes of their students.  Many students do not have the funds to pay for wifi and are not able to drive to a library to connect to the internet.  Even if a student has technology, there is always a large chance their technology might not work.  This is not the fault of the student and they should not be penalized for it.  Technology caused student to be more stressed and worried bout whether or not their assignment will upload on time, or if a lesson will load and play, and it is not necessary.  Technology is not practical or easily accessible for many students.  
6057	A student who comes inside on her snow day to work on homework, watch lessons, and turn everything in on time, but gets back to school and listen to the same lesson again because her peers did not learn the information, is wasting her time.  The students who do not do the assignment are also wasting the time of the teacher who made the lessons and assignments.  For the students who might attempt to do the work, there is nothing stopping them from sitting on their phone during online lectures and nothing stopping them from searching for answers online, making distance learning completely ineffective  Many students do not do the homework assigned while in class when the directions are given to them in person, so they will not put in the extra effort from home.  
6058	While distance learning may seem great, it is not practical or time effective.  Distance learning and virtual lectures may seem like a great way to adapt the classroom to more modern standards, but is not time effective, realistic or easily accessible to all.  Students will not benefit from being able to attend classes from home it would only waste the time of teachers and students who do the assignments.  Technology issues are too great a problem for virtual classrooms to be practical and when a student does not come to school they are not going to attend an online lecture of do extra school work at home.  Students are not able to get the same quality information and education from an online video as they get from a lesson given by a teacher in person that can be adapted for each class.  Online distance learning is not beneficial to students, and should not be implemented in schools. 
6059	Dear Senator of the state of Florida,  I belive there is something wrong with our voting system. Evidence has shown that our electoral system has shown some minor errors. In the election 2000 George W. Bush won because he had more electoral votes than his oppenenet Al Gore. But, Al Gore had more popular votes than Bush. 
6060	The electoral college has been a way of electing our president for years , but there is one question . Do the peoples votes really matter? 
6061	The electoral college is not fair to the voters. 
6062	"This reason is because of their winner takes all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in the states they feel they have no chance of winning. They only focus on the  ""swing"" states , the states they feel they have a chance in or feel they have to win over. During the 2000 campaign , seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all and the largest media didn't get to see a single  campaign ad. Candidates only visit states they feel are important to them which is considered unfair to the voters who actually vote for them. "
6063	The electoral college method  may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state. The fact that they feel their vote has no effect, they pay less attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote. 
6064	The people's votes should matter because it is our country these choies  affect. The electoral college method is discouraging some of the voters to vote. 
6065	Lets get rid of the electoral college and let the people's vote actuaully matter.                                
6066	I believe we should abolish it completely. I believe that we should change our voting system to election by popular vote for the president of the United Sates. 
6067	While it is a good system, it is not reliable and does not let the people truly decide who their representative will be. 
6068	It does bring some certainty of outcome but not as much as it should. 
6069	The electoral college must be abolished because it does not let the people truly decide who their president will be. 
6070	While it does allow them to vote for a slate of electors who then elect the president usually based off of the popular vote, 
6071	they do not always vote for who they are supposed to. The slate of electors that the people vote for are supposed to be trusted to vote for what the popular vote says, they do not always do so. 
6072	"A good example of that is in 2000, when Al Gore ran against George W Bush. Al Gore won the popular vote nationwide over Bush, he still didnt win the presidency because the electoral college did not stay true to their word and voted for Bush. That is because, as shown in Source 3, paragraph 15, "" When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. "
6073	So while you might think your individual vote makes a difference 
6074	it doesnt at all, for you are not choosing which presidential candidate to vote for, you are voting for someone else to vote for the president who might not always stay true to their word and vote for a different candidate. 
6075	Although the electoral college does bring better certainty of outcome than a popular vote, it does not have the certainty it claims to have. 
6076	"In Source 2, paragraph 12 it states, ""Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote."" This is a big worry because the electoral college holds a total of 538 votes which is definetely possible to cause a tie. If this were to happen, then the vote would be thrown to the House of Representatives where state delegations would vote on the president. Then the concept of the presidential campaigns would become pointless because the point of campaining is to try to win over large, swing states to ensure more votes. Because the bigger the states population, the more votes they hold in the electoral college. But that would only work if it was in the Senates hands because the amount of representatives in the Senate for each state is based off of population, whereas the amount of representatives in the House of Representatives is always two for each state. So if the vote was thrown into the House of Representatives hands, then whichever candidate who holds claim over the most states, regardless of size, would almost automatically win the election because each state holds equal say in their vote. "
6077	"""The Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational.""(Plumer, The Indefensible Electoral College) It says it all, when the Founding Fathers made the Electoral college, the country was a lot smaller than it is today. The Electoral College was needed because there was a chance that the election could be tied. Today, the country is huge. The chance of a tie 1 in a trillion chance. I feel that we should give it a try, and abolish the College. This nation stands by freedom, and voting should be a choice.    "
6078	"With our current system, hundreds of thousands of Americans votes don't matter. This mass of people is citizens of eligibility to vote. Where are there rights? What does this say about our system? The ""winner takes all theory"" ignores voters. If a state leans 51% democrat, then the entire state is accounted for the democratic party. What about those 49% of republicans. Where does their vote go? - down the toliet along with the credibility and accuracy of the electoral college. "
6079	Now, if this predicament occurs in near half of our 50 states, a candidate who did not recieve the popular vote will reign triumphant over a candidate who a majority of the American people elected to be their new president. 
6080	"According to, ""The Indefensible College"", by Bradford Plummer, Americans lose out on more than just an acountable vote. Candidates don't even spend time in the states they are certain of having no chance in winning. Logically, candidates only spend their time in the ""swing states"" where they could possibly steal al of that states eleectoral college votes (lines 13-20). Shockingly 17 states didn't see a single candidate during the 2000 election (lines 20-21). We sure did suceed and ignoring hundreds of thousands Americans there. "
6081	The counterclaim for my argument may suggest that the certainty of outcome and the expulsion of run-off elections is enough to substantiate the electoral college. 
6082	"Source 3, ""In Defense to the Electoral College"", even admits that the electoral college is a non-democratic method of selecting a president (lines 15-17). Liars, we are liars then. Americans project an image of America to the world that we are a peacful democracy. However, if the way that we select our leaders isn't even democratic, why are we portraying this false mirage. The electoral college is an anachronism (lines 15- 16). We are a stage four country on the demographic treansitions model. Therefore, our aspirations should be looking forward and not rooted in the past. "
6083	The electoral college system is a mock of the American people and an outdated idea that does not fit in with our current state as a whole. 
6084	Today, technology is rapidly advancing virtually everywhere. The iPhone, electric cars, large appliances, and many more useful new technological inventions have improved and helped assist everyone with their everyday tasks in a quick and resourceful manner. The new technology of the modern world is in workplaces, homes, and best of all, schools. Technology in school has rapidly increased especially as every student at Generic_School now has their own laptop for their own educational use. Now every student can get their work done through a computer at school, but not every student or teacher prefers it. Therefore, today, some schools offer distance learning for students to attend classes from home by way of online testing and course learning on their own. Many students and especially parents are skeptical of these online distance courses because they think that the old fashioned way of staying in school and using paper and pencil is the optimal way of learning. On the other hand, many people think otherwise, so this has become a great debate in the system of education for many counties and individual schools. 
6085	because they can still complete their course or courses task's at home even if they're sick 
6086	some students don't enjoy public school so taking courses at home is more comfortable for those, 
6087	many teachers prefer that their course be taken online at home anyway due to the course's content and structure because it can help the student perform better. 
6088	First, a big reason that a student falls behind and under performs in a class is because they missed school due to being sick and they weren't able to learn it when they got back. 
6089	Attending a class online at home is a great way to stay on pace and not fall behind because all of the information is at the student's fingertips and they can complete their tests and assignments when they are ready and able. They can still also do everything at home while they are sick if they would really like, since all of their materials is already with them on their computer. This way, the student will not fall behind in class, there is less stress, and they won't under perform on their exams because they are still able to learn the information they need on their laptop as usual. On the other hand, if a student is sick and cannot go to school that day, they miss all of their class papers and notes from that day and cannot usually make up what they missed. For this reason, online courses are a much safer and reliable way of learning that do not have the stress of missing a full day of information at school. Online courses may also have to be used for every course anyway before long due to the rapid spread and worry over the lethal Corona Virus, which can close schools and put people in quarantine for weeks. 
6090	Next, many students today are uncomfortable at a public school setting, so they are unable to perform as well in their classes and they don't do well with other people. 
6091	Some are just naturally shy and others just simply do not like working with others. For this reason, attending online classes at home is a great alternative for these students who are not socially comfortable. This way, students can complete projects on their own at home and they can stay focused on their tasks without the awkward feeling of having to worry about others at public school. Another strong quality of attending and completing an online course is that many online courses have fun and interactive lessons that keep a student engaged in the lesson, rather than sitting in a classroom and doing nothing because they are bored of the teaching or they are once again, just uncomfortable socially in a public setting. One on one online video conferencing is also easier for students to talk to their teachers if they need help because they may feel uneasy when speaking to a teacher or others in person. As a result, they also can learn things in an online course that they may not have ever learned if they were taking that certain course in a public school setting. 
6092	Lastly, many teachers prefer and advise that a course be taken online and at home due to the structure and content of the course because they believe the students will perform stronger by taking the course online. 
6093	For example, many students take Econ and Personal Finance online at home during the summer because it doesn't necessarily need a full school year to complete and it can all be self taught through interactive lessons and simulations. These simulations could include learning to complete a tax form or something of the sort that can be completed individually. Also, many English courses can be taken online and some teachers encourage it because many English classes are writing oriented, in which much of the class involves writing essays and research papers on a computer anyway. Therefore, just attending a course such as these at school can be extra work and a potential waste of a students time since it can all be self taught and completed at home online. Teachers specifically may prefer online courses a lot of the time because they do not want to repeat the same exact information to every single one of their class periods and that is usually self explanatory anyway. When courses are taken online at home, the teachers are able to structure the course into interactive courses that can be self taught and completed individually, so that the students can be more successful on their own, rather than taking up a lot of extra time that is unnecessary at a classroom in school. 
6094	Students should not be required to perform community service. 
6095	Students should not have to do community service because it is the students time and it should be up to them on how they should use it. 
6096	Students should not be required to do community service because it will be a conflict with their extracurricular and sports activities. 
6097	Athletes will have to cut practices short because they have to do community service, thus for not allowing them to become better at their sport. 
6098	"Have you ever thought the ""Face on Mars"" might be made by something extraterstrial? "
6099	"Politicts have been around for centuries; politics were made to keep the peace and give everyone a fair expresion to the people. We have all herd of people in political standpoint have been corrupt, but what if our own voting system was corrupt and our votes have never made a diffrence in selecting a president by the people. When we vote for our selected president is it really going to change or make a diffence on who gets elected... right? ""of course it will make a diffrence."" As long as your states electors dont choice by who they feel is the best fit for presidency. On another note what about the Electoral college votes. Why does one canidate always get all the electoral college votes from one state? Why cant we just revert to how many votes the canidate gets? "
6100	Garbage on the grass, gum on the sidewalk that's what we see on our normal routine to school. 
6101	The school should do community service on their community 
6102	Global warming is a immense topic to the whole entire world because it's affecting everybody from City to animal life. If we take this step in the school we would be reducing the amount of garbage in the streets which might affect everybody. We will be able to see cleaner streets, the school will even have a better image than it does right now. Now the grass will last longer and so will the trees. We would see the space we might have left from all that garbage it used to occupy, and if that space is free, we could add something that could come in handy. 
6103	Every time, theirs a student that doesn't care and leave their garbage on the floor. If we open up this program we could make students more responsible to the school. If the students see the hard work some people take to clean the school environment they would appreciate the work they done and might not want to throw their garbage on the floor like they used to. They would see that since now its them that pick up the garbage and not other people they would be more responsible and throw it the garbage can. 
6104	If the program is open up the community would have a better image of itself. The trees and the grass would look healthier, the school would even have a better image too. Graffiti that used to cover up some buildings walls, would now look even better. 
6105	Community Service has always been a debated issue between students. Some find community service an enjoyable experience while others think that community service takes up too much of their free time. I agree with community service being an enjoyable experience. It is a relief to know you can make someone else's life easier and it's an exciting feeling to know that all the hard work you put forth will be appreciated. However, some students find community service boring and something will take up too much of their free time. I do have some suggestions of how we can fix this problem, 
6106	but I believe that community service will be a value to our education and should be required by your school 
6107	In consideration to my previous statement, if we make the activities seem more like a hobby instead of a chore then students will be more willing to join in. Then, maybe, this will cause a domino effect where one student will tell their friends how exciting community service is and this will lead more children to participate. For Ex: When a group of students are going to clean the litter in their neighborhood, they could make this into a sport. Where the kids grab the trash, like bottles or paper, and they throw it into the garbage bag or recycling bin as if they were playing basketball. 
6108	Like if students help tutor kids; this will be beneficial to those kids who can't afford it or really need it. Then there's helping a teacher out, even if its just sorting her books or organizing her papers; this will make their lives easier and that specific person may start to gain a friendship with the teacher. The reason for that is you will see that teacher for quite some time and the two of you may speak to each other and carry out conversations with one other. Students can also visit the elderly which can be an amazing experience; the kid can teach that elderly person a few things and they might share their experiences, knowledge, and tips. This can lead to a friendship where both parties enjoy each other's company. 
6109	I understand that some people in this world do not care about our community at all, but it is very important to at least try to change it 
6110	Requiring students to do community service will make keep our community a clean and safe environment. 
6111	Therefore, I believe that community service should be required for students at school not everyday, but at least maybe twice a week. 
6112	By doing this, you and everyone else who participates in this should be rewarded, but at the same time take responsibility to keep on making this place better for everybody. 
6113	Some students may help with tutoring other students who needs help with schoolwork or something along the lines of that. Other people go around picking trash up of the ground and putting it where it belongs and trying their best to keep our environment clean. 
6114	Today, we still have people going around throwing trash on the grounds. I myself, have experienced people putting trash on the grounds and leaving it there. It hurts me because everyday I look at how much work people put into making schools, office buildings, restaurants, and etc. 
6115	The Electoral College has been here since the founders of this country put it in our Constitution to please both sides. This Electoral College has made a lot of history in our great nation and we appreciate what it has done for us. It's a huge part of our election process 
6116	Their have been to many instances where a presidential candidate has had the popular vote but has lost because he didn't have enough electoral votes. 
6117	"""It happened in 200, when Gore had more popular votes than Bush yet fewer electoral votes, but that was the first time since 1888"" (source 3) This may have not happened more than twice but this could easily happen again and cause a catastrophe. This is why I disapprove of the electoral college. "
6118	"because when they vote for a president they are really voting for electors. The elctors can be any citizen so the voters don't know who the electors are. Voters can rarely decide who the electors vote for which puts them at a disadvantage and is an inconvience for the voters. ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president"" (source 2). "
6119	There has been several of organizations and people who have tried to get the electoral college deleted from election processes 
6120	"including ..."" Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole , the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL-CIO"" (Source 2). These are multiple people with proven track records and are some of many who are ready for change. The electoral college has brought good and bad to our country but there are times when things should be left in the past. "
6121	Using the popular vote as the one and only way of electing presidents is needed in this country. The choice of presidents should be soley up to the american people. There should be no electoral college that can totally change the outcome of a election because one candidate doesent have enough electoral votes. 
6122	America: land of the free, the brave, and millions of proud citizens who live in a country that prides itself on its preservation of human rights and everything else that makes up a proper society. However, in order to remain a fair republic that truly takes into account the opinions of all citizens, we must make one major change. 
6123	The flawed Electoral College must be abolished and replaced with election by popular vote in order to ensure the well being of our country. 
6124	Just look at what happened in 1960, when racist legislators tried to replace the democtratic electors  chosen by popular vote in order to sabotage John F. Kennedy's chances. Then yet another electoral disaster occured in 2000. Both of these events could very easily happen again and the consequences of such mistakes are unfathomable. History has been proven to repeat itself, and this is no exeption. Who's to say that electors won't just ignore the wishes of voters or that legislators won't manipulate the system? When it comes to choosing our leade, whose actions will ultimately decide whether or not America will continue to survive and thrive, it would be a huge mistake to leave this resposibility to one group of individuals. After all, nobody is perfect. 
6125	Furthermore, advocates of the Electoral College make a major fallacy when they claim that voters in swing states are more informed on election information, therefore it's good that the electoral system causes candidates to only focus on them. 
6126	Through this one argument, advocates are essentially assuming anyone who doesn't live in a swing state doesn't care about the election as much and therefore they shouldn't have a say in the matter. This is simply not true. 
6127	In fact, these advocates fail to acknowledge that if voters in other states are not as educated or interested, it is a consequence of the Electoral College. While politicians are focusing all of their time and effort on the 'thoughtful' voters, other citizens don't get the information they need from seeing campaigns and meeting candidates. They are deprived of the opportunity to make an educated decision like swing voters and that is a fault of the college, not the voters themselves. 
6128	If a tie were to occur, the election would be determined by members of the House of Representatives, who do an even poorer job of representing the people considering each state casts only one vote. 
6129	It is also important to note that at the end of the day, election by popular vote accomplishes the goal of reflecting the opinion of the public far better than election by Electoral College. 
6130	The popular vote is a clear statement of voters' opinions and is virtually unable to be tampered with. On the other hand, the Electoral College only complicates the situation by introducing a middle man who is prone to bribery and mistakes. Why should we allow candidates to win because of the electoral vote if they do not recieve the overall approval of the public? Compare the opinions of 538 electors to the opinions of hundreds of millions of voters. Evidently, the opinions of all these voters cannot be properly represented by these 538 electors. It's just impossible both logistically and logically. 
6131	In many cases there is two sides to an arguement. When there is two sides to an arguement it could go either way. In this case the arguement is about the electoral college. What is the electoral college,it is the the process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the consitution as a compromise between election of president by a vote in congress and election of presidentby popular vote of qualilfied citizens.(stated in paragraph 1) 
6132	Driverless cars are the future of transportation. These types of cars will allow for the easy transportation of people without the need to take accout for human fatigue. 
6133	Increasing technological standards along with the development of new programs are allowing for the development of driverless cars with power and complexity never before seen. While driverless cars have been a reality for mulitple years now, the technology to be able to allow them to function is just now being completed. 
6134	Driverless cars would allow for the development of new transportation infrastructure and an upgrade to the traditional way of driving, as well as being more fuel efficient and more enviromentally friendly. 
6135	. People would become better connected in a world occupied by self driving cars. 
6136	 Even looking outside of truly driverless cars, cars that used assisted driving features, like cars made by BMW, GM, or Google, are still capable of helping the driver drive in a more safe manner. 
6137	It is important to understand why driverless cars propose a danger to us, however, because the benefit of an automated car is not gained without risks and challengs. 
6138	Driverless cars, at this very moment, are not capable of dealing with complicated traffic situations or roadblocks, and this is primarily the argument for why these cars should not be allowed on the open road. Other arguments include the reasoning that the enjoyment is being taken out of driving by allowing a computer to do the driving for you. In regards to that, I respond by saying that cars that will have automated features will also be able to be driven. Most are not completely autonomous and will allow for the driver to take control at their leisure. 
6139	In a hypothetical world where the autonomous car drives perfectly in all conditions, the driver would still be able to take control of the car and drive as s/he pleases and continue the drive as they wish it to be driven. 
6140	Some people might see a driverless car as a loss of freedom or a loss of control, 
6141	but a better way to observe the idea of a driverless car is to think of it as a car, just like any other, with a few extra features; and one of those features happens to be that the car is capable of driving itself. 
6142	Another argument not stated in the document was the issue of misuse of the self driving car. A major trajedy in our society is that people would possibly try to use its autonomous abilities to achieve a terrorist goal. 
6143	but this is still not a reason to stop the development of new technology. 
6144	We as humans can not let fear stand in our way and give up on our evolutionary duty because we are afraid that someone else will hurt us for it. 
6145	With self driving cars, the possibilities are endless. 
6146	We have the power to travel anywhere and drive anywhere without worrying about fatigue or losing your way. We could leave Chicago one night, get a good nights rest, and wake up in Washington D.C., parked at your hotel. A fully developed automated car society would help to reduce the risk of collisions and would reduce emmissions that are harmful to the enviroment. Advanced technology has become more readily available to the consumer in recent years and allows for the driverless car to be cheaper and easier to produce than ever before when technology that these cars required was but a dream. Driverless cars could allow for a safer society that is more connected with transport that is cheaper and more reliable than that of the traditional car. Greater fuel efficiency and the lower enviromental impacts would promote the development of these cars by companies wishing to see a better world. 
6147	State Senator, please realize that this is not fair or justifiable. There may be an upside to the Electoral College, however, it is in my strongest opinion based on factual content that this is not a fair method and it should be abolished. Being empathetic for the ordinary voters of the United States would provide clarity for your opinion on the situation. Imagine if you were a general voter who did not get an official vote in the presidential election; you would feel cheated also. This is why I ask you to strongly consider these legitimate words.    
6148	Chossing your president is something very important and we need a way , a method to help us pick the right one. The Electoral College is the best way of picking the right president and doing it right. If you pick your president by a popular vote it would only lead to a disaster. In our world we need a method like this one that will guide us to make the right desion and something as imporatant as our President, well we can just pick out of anything we have to do it  wise and neat so the right choice is picked 
6149	This nation is a nation of freedom and peace. Not for a bunch of people who are power hungry. The Electoral College is fair and equal, it is the government that is not. If the government would only change for the better then there would be no problem. This nation is still young compared to all the other countries. They have gotten all there issues taken care of, but we have not. The reason is that some of the officials are power hungry and do things to take care of themselves and not others, but some are not and they want to make this country better. Those are the ones that should stay and not the power hungry ones. They make it fair. So I strongly belive that the Electoral College should stay the same, and that the government should be the one to change. 
6150	the many positive capabilities of the cars 
6151	, advanced technology that is currently available and constantly being improved, 
6152	the safety features added by the driverless car. 
6153	One major consideration for the development of the driverless car is the environmental benefits 
6154	"The Google cofounder Sergey Brin says that the cars ""would use half the fuel of toay's taxis."" There is a large fear of increasing gas prices and lack of natural resources in the world today. The production of driverless cars would quell those fears as they are much more fuel efficient than the cars used today. Brin also states that the cars would ""offer far more flexibility than a bus."" This is crucial as the bus usually has a route that it must adhere to while the driverless car can go straight to the desired location. This aspect also positively impacts the environment. "
6155	Similarly, the advanced technology that is already being created also helps with the development of the driverless car. 
6156	"Beginning from the late 1950s, the concept of the driverless car was already thought of. Now, the concept is beginning to come to fruition due to the advanced technology created. The most important bit of technology on the driverless car is the spinning sensor on the roof, also known as the LIDAR. The LIDAR is able ""to form a constantly updating 3-D model of the car's surroundings."" Without the LIDAR, the accuracy of the driverless car would be greatly reduced as the car would have no sense of its surroundings. Another technology that was greatly enhanced is the antilock brakes. In the 1980s, the antilock brakes ""used speed sensors at the wheels"" to monitor when the car was becoming out of control. Back then, the antilock brakes only had a sensor to monitor the wheel's speed. Now, the antilock brakes have become more advanced to the point that they are able to ""detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers."" The antilock brakes have evolved from only having a sensor that monitors speed to sensors that can detect many dangerous conditions. The advancement of car technology greatly affects how safe and successful a driverless car may be. A driverless car would most likely not be able to work in the 1980s with the speed sensor as the antilock brakes. Now, the driverless car would be able to work very effectively as it combines a plethora of sensors and cameras to ensure safety. "
6157	Speaking of safety, the driverless cars all have a safety feature that guarantees almost the maximum safety potential. 
6158	"The reliance of a driver within the driverless car finalizes the development of the driverless car. If the car encounters a foreign situation, the driver will just be notified and will take over from there. This concept of passing over the responsibility of driving makes the driverless car very safe. As long as there is an alert driver within the car, the car is almost certainly not going to make any accidents. Car developers designed the driverless car to ""steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills."" Thus, the car will do most of the driving and when there is a difficult situation, the human driver will take over. This ensure the utmost safety of the driver and the passengers as there is an extremely low risk of an accident occuring. There are ""driver's seats that vibrate"" and the Google car even ""announces when the driver should be prepared to take over."" This increases the safety of the driverless car as the driver will be notified when to take over. Therefore, the driver will also know the situation and will be ready to handle any troubles the driverless car couldn't handle. The safety features positively affect the development of the driverless car. "
6159	All in all, the cutbacks on the usage of natural resources, the advanced technology used to increase the safety of the driver, and the many built in safety features advocate for the production of the driverless car.   
6160	electors choose the president and the vice president and the counting of the electoral votes by congress. 
6161	I have a very strongly worded, persuavive letter written for you today of why our united nation, must abolish the electoral college. I am aware that the electoral college is one of the main ways president's become elected, but it's serving an unjustice to our nations people. You must do something of the crisis that our country is facing with the Electoral College. 
6162	I have two compelling reasons of why the electoral college should be abolished. 
6163	"My first reason of why we should abolish the electoral college is because of the method it is done in.  What I mean by this is, according to Source 1:What is the Electoral College?, it says, ""Most states have a  ""winner- take all"" system that awards electors to the winning presidential canididate."" The winner- take all system is not a fair way to elect a president becuase of its biases. "
6164	"The candidates running for the presidency only visit the largly populated states in order to get their electoral points, for instance, most candidates go to Californa or Texas becuase those are the states that have for electoral points. But, by doing this all the smaller states that have less electoral points are never visited by the candidates, the voters then may have never seen an ad or campiagn for a certain candidates . According to Source 2: ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong"", by Bradford Plummer, it states, ""During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didnt see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and votes in 25 of the media markets didn't get to see a single campiagn ad"". On the contrary, it is stated by Source 3: In defense of the Electoral College, it states,"" No reigon has enough electoral votes to elect a president."" This is true, but candiadtes focus on larger states that will supply them with more electoral votes, and don't even visit or pay any attention the smaller states. I strongly negate the Electoral College. "
6165	Another reason, why the Electoral college is a disaster factor is becuase most of the United States citizens prefer a direct election to the kind we have now, Electoral College. More presiciely 60 percent of voters to dont want the electoral college, that's majority of our population! If majority of our nation is against the electoral college why haven't we abolished it? 
6166	"In conculsion, ""It's offical: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly aserations without much basis in reality"", according to Source 2.  I would like you to consider all the problems our nation is facing due to the Electoral College. I have stated two contentions of why you should abolish the Electoral College; First,the method of how its done is very bias and unfair and secondly, because the Electoral College is a ""Disaster Factor"" or  causes many disruptions in our country. "
6167	We should abolish the electoral college. It nakes voting unfair and is dangerous to the American society. It corrupts the soul of all Americans and makes people unhappy. 
6168	If we want our society to live, we should end the electoral college.  
6169	A large state gets more attention than a smaller state does... Is that what we really want in our country 
6170	Driverless Cars Are Coming is a short article that depicts the use of computerized cars that are being made. The cars are supposed to be safe and trustworthy. One part of the article describes a public-transport taxi system that would take people from place to place, navigating through other driverless cars. The idea of this self controlling, moving car can be very advantageous to people, using less fuel, prevent or stop car accident, and take people to their destination at ease. However, there are issues with the automated automobile. How will driverless cars adapt with cars with actual drivers? How will everyone acquire the self-driving car when they could cost fortunes? Also who is blamed if and when prevented accidents aren't prevented? Lastly what about car computer hacking? 
6171	The idea of the self driving car is courageous, but it will not work for our society. 
6172	First, driverless cars can drive at ease when other driverless cars are in uniform with the other cars, but when one car has someone drivng the car then the driverless cars aren't able to predict the outcome the real driver will make. 
6173	Driverless cars are very mechanical, probably costing much more than one's average car price. 
6174	If an area with all driverless cars is made, what happens when the self driving cars do finally mess up and crash into another driverless car? Who should be blamed? 
6175	the idea of driverless cars cannot be comepletely viable for safety of passengers and safety of citizens on the side of the street. There is no way driverless cars could be able to completely predict a real drivers movements. The cars could be hard for everyone to buy and adapt to. Last, you cannot find true blame for a driverless cars action when there is not anyone to blame. The driverless cars will not work in a society that is not ready for it. 
6176	How would you feel if you were running for President and only 1 party got to pick the winner ? That just seems unfair and Unorganized to me 
6177	"The People"" should have just as much an say-so in who the President and Vise president should be .Well they do but i dont think the State Partie should have anything to do with the votes. "
6178	For some students, this policy is outrageous and should be thrown out of consideration, for others such as myself, we believe that it is fully justified and would help drive students to achieve higher grades so that they may continue to participate in their sport. 
6179	To allow students to perform poorly and still play sports in the school is, in my opinion, rewarding unacceptable work. 
6180	Education should always come before sports, and if one can get by with C's or D's and continue to participate in Football or whatever else pleases them, then they won't be driven to complete their work with an effort, because they don't need to achieve in academics to achieve in their sport. Education is number one, then comes Football, or Soccer, or Baseball, or Track, and the leniency with academic performance doesn't support that basic fact. 
6181	If a B average is the minimum for participation, then it may inspire students (who would otherwise just float by) to do their work, do it well, and bring home a nice progress report every few weeks. 
6182	I hope that you take this letter into your consideration, and I hope you decide well on this policy. Some may disagree, some may downright despise the policy, but in the end, it does everyone a favor, and that's hard to argue with from a logical standpoint. In the end, it's the simple fact that education comes before all else, because it's more likely that one would become a doctor, a lawyer, or an engineer than a professional sports player, and allowing the minimum work to pass won't help the student later on in life. 
6183	More companies are pouring in more and more money trying to make the perfect driveless cars but pursuing the driveless car is a negative thing for car manufacturing should not be pursued. 
6184	it still requires the assitance of the driver. 
6185	Driveless cars have huge and complicated safety risk. 
6186	Driveless cars are not perfectly save and can cause major problems when driving in places with construction or complicated traffics or complicated driving routes and if the driver does not take control of the car, the driver and the passengers in the cars and other people can get seriously injured. Driveless cars are so doubted for their safety that certain states have limited the use or banned them from being driven or tested in their state roads, a few states who have done this is Calforina, Nevada, Florida, and the District of Columbia. Driveless cars who notify people when to take over if the emergency are still not that safe as they have no effective to notify the driver that he should take over, many companies have tried different techniques but none of them have found an effective way to get the drivers attention in case the drivers needs to take over because the car cant handle the roads or sencario it is in. Without an effective way to get the drivers attention, to take over if the time is needed, the car can have an major accident because the driver attention was caught to take over the car and the car couldn't handle the situation, leading to an accident. Even with accidents the problems do not end their, many people and car manducatures and companies do not know if you blame the driver or the manfucaturing. With this not settled out, you getting in an accident because techonolgy an compnay has put in a car was incapable of handling safe driving could make you be blamed for the accident and making you pay alot of money to fix your car and damages while the company who put this faulty techonolgy in the car, walk away with no problems. 
6187	Driveless cars are dangerous and can be hazardous to the driver and the people around the driver and also leave you to deal with the consequences of an accident. 
6188	Driveless may seem cool at first, being able to drive all by thereself and not needing the help of any real person but what does that do to the driver. With driveless cars it makes driving cars for the driver boring. 
6189	Driving without driveless cars was a joy and something people love to do but with driveless cars it ruins the experinece as you do not get to control the car anymore and just have to watch it drive itself. This has been a big problem for car companies as they have to get people to buy their car and enjoy the ride and the car and companies do not know how to do that. Werner Huber who is the BMW project manger said that with cars being able to drive by themselves they have to find new ways to attract and make the costumers enjoy the car and they can not find a way to do that without putting the driver adn the passengers at risk. The only things they have founded to make the car enjoyable to drive with driveless cars is entrainment systems or texting but all these may be enjoyable to the driver but also puts the driver at risk. 
6190	Driveless cars are cars that are suppose to be able to drive by themselves with nobodies assitance but that is not true. These so called driveless cars are not driveless car but are cars that can do basic functions of driving but when anything hard pops up, the driver has to drive the driveless car. 
6191	This is a real problem becasue having a driveless car should mean that the car should be able to drive without the help of the driver but they can not and make the driver just sit there in the driver seat, staring out the window waiting and getting bored, so they can drive the driveless car when it is in a hard driving condition and if they do not do that they are in risk of a harazardous accident. One of the most technonlgical advances car made by BMW, is a driveless car and is suppose to be driveless car but is it really, the car can only handles speeds up to 25 miles per hour and any faster and the driver has to take over and even when the car is driving itself the driver needs to keep his or her hands on the steering wheel. These self proclaimed driveless cars may look like driveless car but they are not, they require as much assiatant from a real person as non-driveless cars do.  
6192	Companies all over the world are spending money to make the best driveless car out there but is it really worth it. Driveless cars are not a positive aspect to the automotive industry but is a negative aspect of the industry. These so called driveless cars need the assistance of real life human drivers as much or even sometimes more then regular non-driveless cars, these driveless car also are extremely boring to drive and ride for the driver adn companies can't find a way to fix it, and last but not least these driveless cars are hazardous. These cars can cause accidents, can not deal with hard driving, and can leave you with the consequnces of a horrible accident. Driveless cars might sound amazing and awesome part of the future but it is an negative aspect of the automotive industry and letting that negative aspect get s foothold in the future will be disatorous. 
6193	Community service is a great opportunity to help others. 
6194	It not only helps and brings happiness to others but in ways you'll find that doing community service can help you too. 
6195	Many people do it so willingly because of the good feelings they get from knowing that they're making a difference and benefiting someone else without them having someone to pay them to do it. 
6196	It also helps people greater understand charity and service to others of which the feelings you get from doing these things come no other way. 
6197	In the end most people feel accomplished and they are sometimes helped just as much as the people they were helping. They volunteer most of the time not for money but for reasons like what i just talked about. 
6198	When forced to do something a persons natural reaction is to strike out against or oppose it. The students might start to feel this way such as convicts who are assigned community service by the state do. If this happens the service will be done poorly with little effort and the feelings that are supposed to come from it will be pushed away. 
6199	By helping and asking politely and advertising community service there will be a far better chance that students will do it, but more importantly they will want to do it. Get the students excited about it and they'll do it and be able to freely experience the great blessings community service has to offer for both sides. 
6200	Yes you will have a lot less people that end up doing it, but the people that do will be excited, motivated and ready to make a difference in the world one community at a time.  
6201	Electoral college has helped in many ways. Many people have suggested keeping the electoral college or changing to election by popular vote for the president of United States. 
6202	I believe that changing to election by popular vote for the president would be best bescause 
6203	first the more people who vote its easier to determine who would become president 
6204	because it will aviod any problems having to choose for president. 
6205	I do not think that it is a good idea to require students to perform community service. 
6206	I, for one, enjoy doing community service, but if it is required, many other students may be upset and object. 
6207	The students might be upset because maybe some don't like the community, or doing any extra work. 
6208	Other students may be unhappy with the idea because they may have to give up some of the extracurricular activities in order to find time to do community service work. 
6209	First of all, many kids at my school do not have enough time to do any amount of community service. 
6210	Some teens have sports, commitments, and maybe even part-time jobs.  Others may have to watch their younger siblings at home because their parents come home late at night and are unable to care for the little children.  Therefore, teens in these types of situations would not be able to do any community work, or they would have to give something up, like a sport that they love ,or a job that they need to support their family. 
6211	Second, some families do not like this community and do not agree with how it works.  
6212	The kids from those families would probably get in trouble because their beliefs, and would have to do service even though they don't want to.  This may cause disagreements with the school and the family.  I think it would be a bit unfair. 
6213	I know a couple of people that would never do community service, and if they had to , they would do it half-heartedly and with disdain.  
6214	To the state and the state's country, the election of our president must be seen carefully and wisely. As the citizens of the state, people must realize that choosing someone to take control of orders and regulations and the way the country evolves, is a process that needs to be thought of and taken fairly. The president is to serve the people of his country well with responisbilities that can vary to meet the needs of the country,but the electoral college seems to become more and more unfair to those who vote. 
6215	It must be changed to meet the needs of giving a responisble president, a more trustworthy election and the votes cast must be directly towards him rather than the electors. In other words, the Electoral College must be changed to become more fair towards the citizens. 
6216	"In the article  What Is The Electoral College by the office of the Federal Register, it states that the election process is held every four years along with the after election prepared by the govenor titled ""Certificate Of Ascertainment"" which sums the canadidates and electors as well as the winning canadidate. It is obvious that the voters only know so much of what they vote for and do not really get a good taste of how the presidential canadidate is like. It can be clear that as a blind election, the voters have no hints of who they might be voting towards and in the end can cause a major catasrophe if a canadidate has very little intentions for the states. In agreement to the article the text  In the defense of the electoral college by Richard A. Posner it begins to sate the election of Romney who, by increasing his plurality and possesing only regional appeal, lost the peoples desire to vote for him thinking that the man has no regards for their interest and does not have any intentions of improving their needs or helping with creating a community where the people can rely on Romney. The actions taken began to change the thoughts of the citizens and create a petrifying conclusion that the man was not on the run to be everyone's president. This dilema could have been changed around if Romney had shown that he had cared more for his state and his country and thought more about the needs he could fill and the actions he could improve, then many of the voters would have most likely shown repsect and a desire for the man to be choosen as their new president. On the opposing hand Romney had not shown any of those qualities or passion which had caused for him to be thought of as unresponisble and selfish.  The country has more than thousands and thousands of people to serve and direct. It can be understood that having a large amount of citizens can result in uncertainty towards the election and the votes cast, yet it is yet to be changed to a more reasonable way of confronting it. With many systems such as ""Winner-Take -All"" due to states titled as the ""Swing States,"" it can be an untrustworthy election fo rmany voters around the country. The election process not only need to be changed to select a more responsible canadidate, but to create a more trustworthy system of itself.  "
6217	There is very little equality when it comes to elections especially, when the states are giving an unreliable system to choose for them. 
6218	"States that are considered ""Toss Ups"" are selfishly awarded the system named ""Winner-Takes-All"" due to how they apparently pay closer attention to the campaign. In the article  What Is The Electotal College by the office of the Federal Register, the method is first introduced in paragraph 7. Stating that the purpose of the ""Winner-Take-All"" system is not only,but to award all electors to the winning canadidate. It is said to be unrelaible and untrustworthy due to it's focus on states that appear t have more attention towards the election. On a more basic level, some states such as Rhode Island and South Carolina had not even witness the campaign and even leaving a few voters to have no say. Going back to the misunderstanding of the election of Romney,the country wittnessed an iresponsible canadidate that had ran for president. With the unreliable ridiculous system ""Winner-Take-All"" some states may or may not have even experienced how Romney had acted and his intentions towards the elections and the campiagn. With very little knowledge of the presidential canadidate and with limitations of voting and campaign ads, there is very little trust given towards the election process especially with more than a few states that are not being taken very seriously, with very little say. If the Electorial College could give off more information and more become more reliable towards all states, the process would be less sinister and more apreciated. "
6219	There are many more other factors in which the Electorial College must be changed to meet the appropriate dilemas and needs of the voters and their intentions towards the campaign. 
6220	Let us say, there have been many incidents where elections have been on the edge of a major dilema. Wondering why a straight up orderly process can go to the point of a catasrophe, can all be easily explained as unfair.  All can be simplified in the article  Why Even The Best-Laid Defesnes of the system are wrong by Bradford Plumer, states back to the disater factor of the election of John F.Kennedy. It states back to the 1960's where faithless electors had pushed aside the votes and sayings of Louisiana had decided to vote for whomever they had wanted. It had caused a problem of course since the votes where not even of the people, but of the selfish sick minds of the electors who toke the process into their own hands. In the same paragraph it staes back to when the state of Hawaii had sent in two slates of electors to congress. With the unreliable actions of Richard Nixion,  had validated his opponent's electors of course to win over the campaign. once again another issue arises in the article  Five Reasons To Keep Our Despised Method Of Choosing The President, it agrees with the unfairness of the electorals by giving the example of how the Electorial College had turned off the potential voters due to the knowledge that their votes will be uncared for. In paragraph 23, it states that in the state of Texas, it was known that the votes would have know effect of the campaign what so ever. It aslo had staes that voters in politcal elections have no care rather than to express the political refrence than what the peole think or decide. 
6221	This sums up that the process is unfair to many of the states voters and must be changed to become more open and share the equality with those who are losing thier trust. 
6222	The elector college is a controversial subject today in america, based on many questionable policies that leave many americans confused and cheated. 
6223	This is why I argue in favor of changing to election by popular vote for the president of the united states. 
6224	With the electoral college way of electing a president voters arent actually voting for the president, they are voting for a slate of electors who will then vote for the candidate. There are so many things that can go wrong when electing like this 
6225	Voters can't neccessarily control who their electors vote for, you may vote for a certain slate of electors but they may still go ahead and vote for someone else. Sometimes voters get confused and may vote for a slate of electors who are for the wrong candidate. For example, in 1960 segragationists in the Louisiana Legislature almost succeded in replacing the democratic electors with new ones who would oppose John F. Kennedy, so a popular vote for Kennedy would not actually go to him. Although these things dont happen all time their is always the possibility and why take that chance on such an important event, choosing our president the person who will lead our country. 
6226	In an election their really is a process of voting and voting again. Instead of couting the number of people who want a certain president and so on. We are viewed as a state and some states having more say than other even if the votes are in the same margin. This is the reason why some states are focused on more by the candidates and are heavily educated on the topic and given more attention than smaller states whose votes wont change much. an even bigger problem is te fact that most states operate on a winner-take-all basis so even a slight majority vote one way will give that person all of the votes. A very worrying prospect as expressed in source two is the possibility of a tie. in which the election would be given to the house of representatives. Each state only gets on vote so a representative representing 500,000 people would have as much say as representatives representing 35 million people. 
6227	Although there are many arguments against the electoral college there still are people who argue in favor of it. There is a certainty of outcome with this process. There will less likely be a run off election with this process 
6228	I believe that community service is extremely important and that all students should be required to perform some community service. 
6229	Community service helps out the community a lot, so the students will be making their homes a better place to live and learn. 
6230	Next, community service will help with your education, because kids who do community service are more likely to get into a good college. 
6231	First of all, community service makes the place you live a better place, by creating a better environment to work, learn and live, as well as make everyone happier. The community benefits a lot from kids or adults actively participating in community service. 
6232	Research shows, that the cleaner and more beautiful the town or city is, the happier the people are. Who is happy when they are living in a trash can? Community service helps clean up the town, by simple things like picking up trash, or larger projects like planting trees. Education also benefits from community service, because we can teach the younger generation skills they need to grow up. Also, a better looking school, would be a better place to learn, because the students will be happier and more motivated. 
6233	This is because they are constantly helping people out, and doing the right thing. This way they will feel good about themselves, and will be a better person overall. I am a boy scout, and i always participate in activities such as, help cleaning up a state park, and help cleaning up the Connecticut River. After i do these things, i feel ready good about myself because i did the right thing, and helped out our community a lot. Furthermore, scientist have shown that students who do community service have a better chance of having a happy life than people who don't, because you will always feel good about yourself and how you have helped your community. 
6234	Another reason that community service is very important, is because many ivy league colleges, and other colleges in general, are always looking for people who regularly participate in community service and also volunteer. 
6235	I personally knew a person, who didn't have all A's in school, and didn't get a great score on the SAT's, but she was an volunteer at a hospital and part of a organization that helps homeless people. She got accepted into Harvard University because she did all that community service. Community service helps out a lot in our lives, by both building character and also it helps tremendously in applying for college. In addition, it also helps a lot with our education, because last year we won our regional science bowl, because some high school students decided to help out our them and come to our practices to teach us. This was very helpful for us and we benefited a lot because of that. They probably also felt better about themselves that they were teaching the younger generation and helping us out. People don't know how much you can learn from kids older than you. you can probably learn more from them than teachers, because you look up to them and respect them the same or maybe more than your teachers. So community service is extremely in education. 
6236	I think you should require community service to every kid in the school, Because we would be helping the environment and making our community a better place to live in.  
6237	"One good reason why you should require is so we have a city that people could come and say ""wow what a helpful city this is!"" "
6238	"We would be helping the city look nice, not only that it would bring more people to wanting to come to our city and live here and our population would grow! our people say ""Keep Austin Clean!"" and if we can make every kid do community service to help clean the city, we could have and keep Austin the cleanest city in the United States. "
6239	Another good reason would be that we would be helping the environment, 
6240	the animal shelters would be nice and the animals would be good and not suffer, the air won't be polluted, fishes won't be dyeing from people throwing things in the water, and it would make our environment safe for us and the wild animals that live in our city.  
6241	Another good reason that it would be good is that it would give us an advantage on our high school credits. 
6242	we need the credits to pass high school, so why not start now and finish it before we graduate out of high school. in fact, in high school most of the kids get their credits by community service! so this would give us an advantage for next year and you would help us reach our goal to graduate in a few years 
6243	I think you should require it, at least to the 8th graders, because we need to start taking more responsibility in everything we do, and we would be helping our city and the people and animals that live around us, and we would be helping the future people living in this city by keeping it clean for them. 
6244	i think that the Electoral College should not be able to elect the president. I think it should be a coice of the people. 
6245	"(In source 2) Even presidents want to get rid of the electoral college that is saying something. People would rather have a direct election then the kind we have now and I agree. See when the people are voting for electors they dont know what that elector is going to vote for they can only hope for what he is going to vote for. (source 2) Paragraph 13 ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. "
6246	See if we had a vote to see if we should have to electoral college i think alot of people would vote no. I dont see why we cant have this vote as a country then there wouldnt be a topic to argue about. The electoral college is a decision that was not in the constitution i believe so it can be removed very easily. My opinion is that we take the electoral college out because it is causing nothing but arguing. We deserve to pick if we want to have a president we want or not. We deserve this power atleast, we dont have any power as regular people we deserve this. They shouldnt have the right to take this away from us 
6247	I think that we should change the voting system from the Electoral college to the most popular vote. 
6248	If the voters can not get there votes in to the nominee that they want then how do the votes go to the right elector. For example,the winner take all system,presidential nominees go to the states that they know they have a chance of getting there votes from. A few states never saw a campaign ad such as Rhode island and south Carolina,voters from 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad.  
6249	driverless cars would not be a good idea to implement into society because drivers could get reckless at the wheel. 
6250	"In the text it stated that ""None of the cars developed so far are completely driverless. They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents"" meaning that at some point the driver would have to help the car navigate at times when the car couldn't(7). Which imposes that the drivers would have to be aware of his/her surroundings at all time when the time was needed for them to take the wheel again. But, doesn't that defeat the purpose of the car being driverless. No one would want a driverless car that still needs to be driven? ""Wouldn't drivers get bored waiting for their turn to drive""(8). And the most important question is, what would drivers do to pass the time when they're not driving. They could distract theirselves with their phones, music or any passengers which could cause them to miss out on any important message from the car telling them to drive or take over in the needed situation. This is where the reckless aspect of the driverless car comes in. Missing the important message could cause accidents and harm to other drivers or pedestrians. And, this cause of harm to others around leads to my next argument against driverless cars and that is lawsuits. "
6251	driverless cars would not be a good idea to implement into society because of who would be to blame if accidents did happen. 
6252	"In the text it explained how new laws would have to be created to go along with the cars when they are proved to be ""more reliably safe""(9). But what would happen ""If the technology fails and someone is injured""(9). This issue could cause many lawsuits filed against innocent ""drivers"" and many lawsuits filed against companies who were not aware of the issue with the cars technology. Sometimes things happen and because technology can not be trusted 100% of the time these cars should not be able to exist. Lives could be on the line and many people who were not to blame will take the blame for this mishap. The car could just cause a million more problems instead of solving the laziness of humans will not to want to drive. "
6253	driverless cars would not be a good idea to implement into society because of its proness to being hacked. 
6254	Anything in the world could be hacked. Anyones phone can be hacked, computers can be hacked and even intelligence units can be hacked. So, if these things can be hacked then what makes one think that this driverless car can't be hacked. And, if hacked there would be no telling what the hacker could do to the car. For example, cause it to crash or lead the car into an area the driver in unfamiliar with because they're not paying attention. These examples could all cause harm to more than just the driver and that shows why this car should not be implemented into society, because it has various accounts on how it can misfunction. 
6255	These examples of recklessness, misblaming and hacking all show why the idea of having driverless cars are not a good idea. They can mess up society and cause harm in more ways than it could help society. Although the car is a very unique way of showing advancement in the technological world, one would have tot look at both sides before concluding whether or not this is a good idea, and in this case it seems that the bad outweighs the good. 
6256	Also, it was established as a compromise between election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. 
6257	Another example is helping out the elderly people, like carrying their grocery bags or helping them clean up their back yards 
6258	Helping the elderly can help them. Maybe their too weak to carry their own bags and they need help. A lot of elderly people now a days are dying because their trying to do chores they can't really do but they have to do because no one is their to help them do them. 
6259	Think about all the sea life that's died because they got tangles up in a trash bag and suffocated because people are too lazy to put their trash bags into their trash bags. If you clean up trash your saving and animals life and that's a good thing to do. 
6260	Another reason why I think community service should be required is because it looks good on college applications. 
6261	When you apply for a college their going to first consider a person who has had community service hour then someone who has no community service hours. They would consider a person with community service hour over someone who has no community service hour because that shows that they actually care about what's going on with the world.  
6262	Doing community service can also help you make some friends outside of your school. Also doing community service can help you as a person. 
6263	It can help you learn about how its a good thing to do and also spend some of your day outside in the fresh air. If one day your stuck at home and need something to do you should go outside and do some community service it makes your day less boring and you get to get out of your house for a little while and do something good. 
6264	I think that students should all have to do some community service. 
6265	For example, if everyone did community service a lot of people will be helped. 
6266	They could go to shelters and help serve food or help pick up trash for the community. They could also go tutor elementary school children like they mentioned that some of the kids do that. It would make the people your helping very happy or proud of the community. 
6267	Students should be required to do a certain amount of hours for community service before they graduate. 
6268	Plus if you think you are too busy of a person to do community service pick a day when you don't have anything to do. 
6269	Do community service for at least a couple hours it will make you and the people you helped happy and you will also feel better about yourself as well.  
6270	In conclusion, community service is one of the best things you can go do to get involved. More students and even people should start and do community service whenever they can. I think that everyone should help out at least a little because everyone can make a difference. community service is very important and everyone should have a part in it to make the world a better place to live on.  
6271	For centuries, we have followed a certian system estabolished by our founding fathers. This system is called the electoral college. This system is based off voting for the president through electoral votes rather than based off more popular. The state has an overall say through its electors 
6272	The second reason the electoral college should be taken away is that the system has much room for failure. Electors could easily betray the will of the people 
6273	"They have much more power than the standard voter. The electors would completly oppose the most ""popular"" vote and put in their vote for whoever they feel deserves it. This is wrong and totally goes against the idea of giving the people power. This would qualify as just giving a few people power. There could also be room for a tie. This could result in the elcetion ending in the hands of the House of Representatives where the state delegates could chose the president. Not only is this destorying the power of the general public but this could also result in people not getting what they wanted. The delegates cuold go completly against what the people say because they technially have the right to since they have the power of the situation. "
6274	When our great leaders died they're visions didn't die. They wanted the people to be in charge of who runs there country and what happens in them. Why is this not happening the way our founders wanted it. Having the Electoral College is not a bad idea but, its not a great one. 
6275	"Mr. Richard A. Posner states in his article ""  In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President""  that we avoid run-off elections. ""  The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast. For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had only a 43 percent of plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the Electotal College (301 and 370 electoral votes, respectively).There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority of the votes cast; that pressure, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, is reduced by the Electoral College, which invariably produces a clear winner....""  The importance in the counterclaim is that it shows that the Electoral College process had a clear winner. "
6276	If the United States went to a population voting system the percentage of votes would increase dramaticly to cause a honest election. 
6277	"The Declaration of Independence granted us the right to control our government. Thomas Jefferson once stated, ""When a nations government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of its people to abolish it and establish a new government."" After viewing the articles Source 1:""What Is the Electoral College?"" by the Office of the Federal register, Source 2: ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer, and  Source 3:""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner it seems clear that the Electoral Colleges have lessened the power of the people in our nation. With the Electoral College method of selecting our nations new president the people of our nation become less empowered, they may cast their vote but the choice of president is never truly theirs. The Electoral Colleges drive people away from voting because they see the election as if their vote will not matter. "
6278	To further empower the citizens of the United States the Electoral Colleges should be abolished. 
6279	Throughout our nations history the majority vote has lost due to being outvoted when it comes to Electoral Colleges. Because of the majoity vote losing out to Electoral Colleges, people have come to believe their vote will not matter in the long run 
6280	"In Source 2 Plumer declares, ""faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's canidate"". With this method of selection for our country's president, the vote is never certain. The slate of electors that the people essentially vote for may or may not stick to the original plan. This ties back into people losing hope that their vote will not matter because they trust the electors to vote their canidate into office, when the electors could go either way. Another key point is, the canidates may not campaign in states that have a lower number of electoral votes. In Source 1 the Office of the Federal Register also asserted, ""Most states have a 'winner-take-all' system that awards all electors to the winning presidential canidate"". Due to the Electoral College system being based off population some states have more of a say than others. Whenever a state decides their votes for Electoral Colleges the state typically contributes every vote it has to one canidate. When this occurs the state's people may be misrepresented. "
6281	Electoral Colleges do not reflect the democratic style of government we have had for hundreds of years 
6282	"In Source 3 Posner states, ""it is the electors who elect the president, not the people"". Ever since the United States has been around our lifestyle has been purely democratic. The people are supposed to the empowering body of our government and their voice is the one that should be heard. But since we have the Electoral College the voice of the people has become muffled. No longer is the presidential election a democratic event, but one that is decided through the votes of only a few chosen American citizens. Plumer observed in Source 2 that, ""During the 2000 campaign, 17 states didn't see the canidates at all"". If the people of America are truly part of our governing body then they must see the canidates and hear what they have to say. The Electoral College has driven canidates away from states that will not have much say. These states are then left to make a decision for themselves and decide based on their personal preference, they are never able to truly hear what these canidates may or may not have to offer. "
6283	Although the Electoral College has a few appealing qualities, it is mostly an unfair system for the United States. The colleges should not have the power to decide the president, that should be the people that reside in the country's choice. Thomas Jefferson spoke of the people taking control of their country's government and the citizens of America should do just that if they are ever to escape the grasp of the Electoral Colleges 
6284	the cars aren't completely driverless, 
6285	there will have to be new laws made for these vehicles, 
6286	there would be confusion for who to blame. 
6287	"In the article, the author gave examples as to how the cars were given features that'd make them seem driverless. There were, of course, radar features and motion sensors, but at the end of the day the author of the artilce said, ""..None of the cars developed so far are completely driverless."" Now of course they can still do the things needed to drive i. e. steer, speed up, and break, but there are still special sensors made to make sure that the driver still has their hands on the wheel. The author of the article then says, ""This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires."" "
6288	"In the ninth paragraph of the article, it says, ""...even if traffic laws change, new laws will be needed in order to cover liability in the case of an accident. If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault--the driver or the manufacturer?"" There would be too much confusion for the lawmakers and everyone else if there was an accident because although the manufacturers made the car, there was still a driver in the driver's seat, so who is to blame? This would cause a lot of conflict in court cases if there were accidents and someone was to be sued. "
6289	I am against driverless cars because the cars aren't completely driverless, there will have to be new laws made for these vehicles, and there would be confusion for who to blame. The idea of driverless cars is a great idea, indeed, but there would be just too much confusion and conflict regarding these. 
6290	It has come to my attention the many problems that the Electoral College has. I would like to ask that we change to election by popular vote for the President of the United States. 
6291	You see, not only is the Electoral College unfair, but it also creates a lie that tricks everyone into believeing that our President was the one that the majority of America voted for, when that is not always the case. 
6292	First off, the fact that the number of electors for each state relies on the number of members in it's Congressional delegation is just illogical. 
6293	lets say Florida has twenty because of its size, and California has fifty. if both states want to vote for someone different, then California is going to win only because of the size and population difference. So really, you aren't voting for the president...you're voting for the electors who will choose the president. 
6294	An argument can be made against this...that the electors that you give your vote to will be trustworthy and vote for the person that your party wants. 
6295	How does that give us a say though? For example, as it says in the article, Al Gore was the president that the majority of America voted for in 2000...he was the one that everyone wanted. Yet he lost the presidency because of this form of voting. This is a free country, or so we're told, so we need to be given the right of popular vote. 
6296	Furthermore, the Electoral College system is flawed...there are millions of people in America and yet only 538 votes are counted 
6297	All in all, arguments can be made both ways...for the Electoral College process or against it. The citizens of America deserve the very best person to lead them, and that's exactly who we should get...the one that America votes for. I know that there are more efficient and fair ways to do this, all we need to do is use them. At the end of the day though, using the election by popular vote would ensure that everyone would be 100% sure that their vote went for who they wanted, and that's what counts.    
6298	Another example is if the student(s) do community service at a recycling factory, they learn about what is going on in the world and what is the amount of waste humans produce in their country or other counties. Which in turn will lead them to recycle more, which helps the environment and the animals who live there. The student could also have relatives at another country which the can tell them about the amount of waste produced there and what could happen to the world if they don't. Which leads to more recycling, and that helps the world. 
6299	It has recently come to my attetnion as I study our states voting system, that we as Americans do not have enough word in who we have as our leader. In a plethora amount of documents from the United States, and our Consitution it states all men are creted equal, when in all relaity we are allowing the Electoral College have more say in who our president rather than we do. 
6300	Not only does the Electoral College have more say in our President, but it alllows the President to only go to states that they feel is nessisary to go to get the vote. 
6301	It also gives less say to the smaller states making the people there feel there vote doesnt count, allowing them to vote for any party. 
6302	If we change our voting system we can vote for our leader rather than us voting for the slate of electors, and have the most popular leader of our country be our president.  
6303	The first reason i feel we should overthrow the Electoral College is becasue it is discriminating states votes based on there sizes. 
6304	"  In the article,""Does the Electoral College Work"", it states that becasue of the diffrent sizes of our states some people feel they do not get a fair say in who makes decisions for our country. They feel that because they dont live in a big state like Texas they do not have equal say in the decisions our country makes. In the article Plumer wrote, "" In the same vein, faithless electors have pccasionally refused to vote for their party's canidate and cast a deciding vote for whoever they please..."". The Electoral College is changing peoples mind set on how to vote because they feel why should we care if the government does not, can you blame them? If we just took out the simple problem of the Electoral College more voters will vote honestly rather then go with everyone elses vote. "
6305	Another reason i feel we should favor the popular vothing system is because this would show that the soon to be presidents should vist all of there voters rather then the ones they know they will probably win. 
6306	"""Because of the winner-takes-all system in each state, canidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight race in the ""swing"" states."" What the author is saying here is the canidates dont give equal chances to the states to here what they,the canidates, have to say. For example if a democrate is going to states he would most likley avoid the ones full of republicans because he feels he has no chance and does not spend the money. But, if we get majority votes this will allow every indvividual to vote rather a group of republicans. Not only does this allow a better chance of winning for that democrate it allows the voters to feel like they can change there minds because they have a say. This will contribute to the conidates because they can now get there point across to more, rather then to select little groups. "
6307	"What i mean is ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but the slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."" Americans have always wanted to be in power and have a say in what we do but in the case of voting we do not. By doing this we are allowing the government to make all of the decisions for us, as if we were children. When you turn to the legal age for vothing your vote should count. With this majority does not rule, for instance say our votes of 46 percent and 54 percent were to come in. The man of the 46 percent still has a chance of winning when the people had already voted. The problem with that is at that point the peoples word goes out the window, and the government once again jumps in demanding that they choose. "
6308	As we learn more about this topic we realize how rediculious this situation is. Obviously, going with popular vote is the best solution because we will finally be what everyone has been trying to do for decades, be equal. Sir, i hope you understand my årgument and really take into concideration what i have said. Our presidents make decisions for us everyday, dont you think its time me get to make one for ourselves? 
6309	I think it is more fair to have the people of the United States vote directly for their president instead of voting for a slate of electios that then choose the president. 
6310	The Electoral College was a compromise made by our founding fathers. It was made as a compromise between the election of a president through a vote from Congress and election through popular vote. The downside to this way of election is that the voters are not voting for one of the candidates but for their state electors, who then vote for the president. The votes from each of the states electors then count as votes for the candidate 
6311	"Like we said during this speech we said that ""And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, revealing... a natural landform."" Later on we did it again in the speech ""Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001- a cloudless summer day in Cydonia- Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look. ""We had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view,"" Said Garving. ""Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution."" ""Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" Now you may say that we never did that, but we have photographic evidence of that clear photo that lets you see everything on the face. So we have the evidence we need to prove that this photo is real. "
6312	Us citixen's help choose the state's elector when we vote for the President because. When we vote for the candidate were are voting for the candidate's elector. 
6313	"With this in mind, there should be no Electoral College because the author suggests in Source 3: paragraph 19 that ""The Electoral College requires a presidential canidate to have trans-regional appeal. "
6314	"No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite, such as Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing his pularity in states that he knows he will win."" A presidential canidate should be able to gain votes from his region because that is the states the canidate are more familiar with so, he will be able to campaign better in those states and if he becomes president he will be equal to all the other regions. You could avoid this with the fair method of popular vote. "
6315	Truly, the Electoral College should be replaced by popular vote because there is a winner-take-all system. 
6316	"The author shadows in Source 1: paragraph 7 that ""Most states have a ""winner-take-all' system that awards all electors to the winning presidential canidate. However, Maine and Nebraska each have a variation of ""proportional representation."" The thing is that with a popular vote system you would not have to worry about a winner-take-all and states that have a different system than the other states. Just let the people decide and everything will be easy and fair. "
6317	On the flip side, the Electoral College should not be replaced because it avoids any type of run-off election that may occur. 
6318	Do you want to stay at home? There's a lot of countries around the world where schools offer distance learning. Distance learning is where students can stay at home and be home schooled. It can either be online courses or video conferencing. Some people may say that students won't benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they won't be able to meet new people and experience the real world. However, they are incorrect because some students get frustrated around others or even gets bullied which can cause them to not focus and do well 
6319	Clearly, students will benefit from being able to attend classes from home 
6320	It will be very beneficial for some students to attend classes from home because some of them prefer working independently. 
6321	There's a lot of students that like working together and being in groups and discussing things, but some of them are very shy. They're scared to talk around others, so they prefer working by themselves. In school, sometimes you're forced to work in groups or participate in a discussion which will frustrate that student and they won't be able to do it. Consequently, it will effect their grade. This proves my claim by saying that students will benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they won't have to worry about working with others or talk except for the teacher if it's online conferencing. 
6322	It's also very beneficial for some students to attend classes from home because some of them have problems at school or gets bullied. 
6323	Millions of students get bullied in and outside of schools. A lot of the time the problem never gets solved because students are scared to tell someone. If they don't tell anyone about because they're scared from that other person, they're going to continue to get bullied. They won't be able to focus anymore, so their grades will drop. The only thing that will be in their mind is the fear from that other person bothering them again and bullying them which includes; abusing them, insulting them or taking something from them like their food. This proves my claim by saying students will benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they won't have to worry about being bullied or having any problems and they will be able to focus very well.  
6324	Lastly, it can be very beneficial for some students to attend classes from home because some of them live far away. 
6325	There's a lot of students that want to take a certain course like a language or anything but they can't because they live far away. So, by online classes they will be able to take that class without having to go all the way to that certain school. They can either learn it by a website or by a video conference where they will still be taught by a teacher and won't have to go all the away to school. This proves my claim by saying that students will benefit from being able to attend class from home because they won't have to worry about going all the way to that school for those specific classes. 
6326	Some people may say that students won't benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they won't get to meet new people and make friends and they won't really experience the real world. 
6327	However, students will benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they will be able to take a certain course if they live far away, they will be able to work independently if that's what they prefer and they won't have to worry about having problems at school with others like bullying. Being homeshooled and taking online classes is very beneficial and a good idea for others. They won't have to worry about living far away, they won't have to worry about working in groups and being forced to talk and they won't have to worry about having any problems with others. They'll work indecently and will be able to focus and do well.  
6328	"I believe that we shouldn't change the Electoral College ""winner takes all"" system "
6329	Driverless cars could be the way of the future or end up being the worst invention humans have ever fabricated. Driverless cars is a very good idea that could change the world for good. Even though there are some dangers, with research and time, these dangers could be eliminated for good 
6330	The idea of driverless cars is a great idea because the environment will benefit from it greatly and human error on the roads will become a thing of the past. 
6331	With time and research, cars can easily become smarter than a human 
6332	"Humans lose attention on the roads, develope road rage, and brake the law frequently. These are all things that could lead to a fatal crash. For example, ""Further improvments in sensors and computer hardware and software to make driving safer are also leading to cars that can handle more and more driving tasks on their own."" Drunk driving will also become a thing of the past and save more lives than anyone could even imagine. A driver less car can also utilize some of the cars capabilities that a human can not access. ""The information from the sensors can cause the car ti apply brakes on individual and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone. "
6333	The idea of driverless cars is a great idea because the envirnment will benefit from it greatly and human error on the roads will become a thing of the past. Technology is advanced enough where we can develope safe and effective ways of getting rid of human error. Driverless cars are a great example of human innovation becomeing a reality. I look forward to see how driverless cars will excel in todays world and how they can improve our lives in the coming decades. 
6334	Mental health is a big issue in many teens and often gets in the way of learning; however, distance learning could be a solution to this problem. 
6335	For example, some students have social anxiety, so going to a crowded school is hard for them. This mental disorder could and often will impact their learning, not allowing students to reach their full potential. If being in a school with a large number of students is upsetting to them, they could take their classes from home. This would allow them to still be able to pursue an education while not being in a triggering environment, which could make a large impact on their grades. In the comfort of their homes, students would be able to move at their own pace to make sure they know the material, stimulating academic success.  
6336	Some students may have different circumstances in which they are not able to go to school everyday, but distance learning could help them get the education they need despite these circumstances 
6337	Sickness often leads students with two options: go to school and run the risk of infecting others, or staying at home while everyone else is learning, ultimately causing them to be left behind in school. Many students wake up sick but still choose to go to school because they are afraid of being left behind and have their grades suffer, especially in more advanced classes. Going to school puts the other students that they come into contact with at a risk of getting sick, and is the main reason how sickness spreads in schools. With the availability of distance learning, however, students who are sick would be more likely to stay at home instead of going to school and contaminating others. They could rest at home and wait out the sickness while not being stressed out about missing school and having to make up work for all of their classes. 
6338	Online classes are a huge benefit that provides students who are sick with an opportunity to keep up with their school work while not putting others at risk. 
6339	In total, distance learning and online classes provides a chance for students to be able to attend school despite their different circumstances. Students would not have to stress out about missing school because they would be able to attend class from home, which would make a positive impact on their grades. Other students wouldn't have to make a choice to pursue an education or care for their sick relative. Some students wouldn't have to choose between their mental health and the opportunity to go to school. They wouldn't have to run the risk of getting other students sick and missing valuable school time. Instead, they would be able to do classwork from home which would make it significantly easier for these individuals to go to school without sacrificing anything. Online classes would allow all students to have an equal opportunity to have an education, regardless of circumstances that would hold them back should distance learning not be available to them.  
6340	When an Electoral College restores th balance in some large states its a good thing 
6341	Also, when this talks about how it requirs a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal is also a good thing 
6342	the electoral college that is. it changes the way we elect our president,and a lot of people don't like that,me being one,and i think we need to just have a straight forward election. 
6343	 but there are a few things that can be problematic like i don't know say bribery from the president to the electoral college,i mean come on it's not like that hasn't happened before, 
6344	like the whole nixon thing,and Kennedy pretty much cheated on his wife with Marlyn Monroe. but,this can be stopped just with a simple petition to get rid of or change the electoral college. then,this could stop some presidents before agreed with me like Jimmy Carter,Bob Dole, and groups like the U.S Chamber of Commerce and the AFL-CIO according to source 2. Al Gore didn't win because of the electoral college,even though he won the popular vote! 
6345	yeah it was created by the founding fathers,and we should respect there great legacy, 
6346	but that was then and this is now. this is coming from the guy who faught for independence and peace...but had over 200 slaves himself,yeah not much of a hero. 
6347	60% of voters prefer a direct election over a electoral college according to source 2. 
6348	In this day and age, everything is always changing. New technologies and innovations bring about more efficient ways of completing tasks that were once tedious. One thing that hasn't changed in a long time, however, is the education system. Students commute to school, sit in class for eight hours, and then go home and do homework. 
6349	Online learning would save students time because it can be done in the comfort of one's home. 
6350	Online classes are typically completed whenever the student wants to, so online learning would work for learners of all speeds. 
6351	For some students, sitting in class for eight hours straight with little time between classes is grueling, and yet others have no trouble focusing for the whole day. Online learning could let learn at their own pace, wether it be taking breaks throughout the day, or completing all of their work in one sitting. Online learning would also prevent the spread of certain diseases, because students are no longer crouded in the same building together. 
6352	While some may argue that online learning takes away the one-on-one time between students and teachers that is necessary for learning, 
6353	"there is an easy solution to this. If online learning is proposed in schools, students should be able to request video conferences with their teachers if they require additional instruction. If classes are held live online with all of the students instead of done at the students pace, the students could ""raise their hand"" by clicking something on their screen that makes something pop up on the teacher's screen, and the teacher would then call on them. "
6354	Overall, online learning would be very beneficial for students and teachers because it gets rid of commuting time and, in some cases, lets students learn at their own pace. New technologies are made to improve efficiency, and we need to use them to their fullest. The ability to communicate with people from long distanced through calls has existed for decades, and it is about time we use this technology in our school system. 
6355	"Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusingonly on the tightraces in the 'swing' states.""(13) when the candidate know they arent going to win they just step back and try other states if not they know they are going to lose the elections. "
6356	If we keep the Electoral College, then even if you do earn the most individual votes, you might not be elected president. If you have earned the most individual votes then you should be elected president because you have the majority's vote. 
6357	If we keep the electoral College then if you are elected president but do not recieve the majority of the individual votes, the president elected by the Electoral College will not be a popular president to the people who voted against them. 
6358	"Source 2 says, ""Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people."" "
6359	So with the Electoral College, the electors that are chosen might not elect those who they said they would. But with election by popular vote, the person elected will always be who the majority of the country wants as president. 
6360	"Source 1 states, ""Your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators.""  "
6361	some states have more votes than others. If someone who is running get more states to vote for them, it does not mean that they will be elected because they have to get more votes overall from the electors. 
6362	"Source 3 says, ""The advocates of this position are correct in arguing that the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense...it is the electors who elect the president, not the people."" "
6363	with the Electoral College, even though the people vote, they are not the ones who are electing the president. 
6364	"When you vote for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors."" So whoever you are voting for, you dont know if the slate of electors will vote in that direction.         "
6365	You should keep the Electoral College because the founding fathers of the United States Of America established it when they made the constitiution. 
6366	I understand that there have been some issues regarding whether or not to keep the Electoral college or to change the system to a more simple- election by popular vote. From my understanding, the Electoral College has worked for many years with no issues or roadblocks so to speak that have interfered or had a bias on these decisions. 
6367	"When someone hears the words ""driverless cars"", they get excited at the thought of something so futuristic at one time that it seems like something out of a science fiction novel. However, now that dream is becoming a reality. Large companies such as Google or BMW are advancing in this highly experimental field, and Google has been since as early as 2009 "
6368	Moments like these should always be handled by the driver, because the only thing a vehicle needs is one single driver 
6369	There is also the consideration of laws. In our current era, whoever hits someone initially in a traffic collision, is the one to blame, and the one who helps pay off the other driver's bill. Human error is a natural thing, and we all make mistakes, but if there is ever an accident in which an autonomous car is made and is involved in an accident, who is responsible in the end? Is it the driver, or is it the car which is supposed to be incapable of making mistakes? 
6370	Allowing a car to be responsible for one person's life is not the best decision, and should be thought out more accordingly, than just seeing it as a fun toy because our laziness is growing so much, that we can't even drive for ourselves. 
6371	Then there is the cost, both on our wealth and our experience. If we allow cars to drive us around and take us anywhere we like, what will happen when it's our turn to drive. We will be less alert, paying attention to our surroundings instead of focusing on the road. 
6372	but will they have enough time to completely survey the area and assess the situation? Or will the car be able to warn them in time? The answer is most likely to be answered, but is still a dangerous situation for a new driver. 
6373	"In 20 years these cars may be a new one of society's norms, and everyone might own a car that drives on its own. But before we can reach that day, we have to decide if we're willing to pay large amounts of dollars for a car that takes away all feeling of something belonging to us and seeming to be in our control. The ""Cars of the Future"" will cost extraneous amounts of dollars, just for the ability for us to drive only some of the time, and not all of it.  "
6374	Some people may argue that there are beneficial sides to an autonomous car, and of course there are. These cars would cut down our costs on gas, they could even be safer than some humans driving cars, and they could all be traced around on a track designed just for the cars. 
6375	"But it all comes back down to cost. The thought of replacing all roads with ""Smart Roads"" is not only seemingly impossible, but timewise it would take a lifetime. If every single road was taken apart and rebuilt all over America, the world even, it would take at least 10 years, and the cost would be enormous. And these cars are safe, but if that situation ever hits, no one is going to want their death or disability caused by a car driving on its own because of human error, yet again. "
6376	Most people think that the electoral college is not reasonable. I don't think they're wrong. 
6377	The electoral college is very unfair. 
6378	It is unfair because the people's votes might be overuled 
6379	the electoral college is biased, 
6380	they may not pay any attention to the people's opinions. 
6381	First of all, in some cases the popular vote might not be of any value. 
6382	Besides, the popular vote doesn't matter in the decision for president it elects members for the electoral college. So if I wanted to vote for a republican president but the electoral college ends up voting for the democrat I would have wasted my time going to vote. Clearly, the electoral college's vote overrules the popular vote. 
6383	In addition to overruling the popular vote, the people on the electoral college are biased. 
6384	If the people who are on the electoral college are biased then, they might not take people's votes into account to their electoral vote. I know no one would want their vote to be ignored so this is another reason why the electoral college should be abolished. If a democracy means the people decide who their leaders are, then why are there other people who might not represent the people chosing our president. Quite obviously, the electoral college is biased and might not care about the popular vote.  
6385	Furthermore, even if the people's votes go to the electoral college, the college might not even pay attention to the reasons people give to vote for someone. 
6386	Most people don't really care that their votes go to deciding who is on the electoral college 
6387	The electoral college are made up of human beings and they will say no to ideas they don't like. I don't think that the fate of our country should be resting on the idea that if one person doesn't like someone they will reject the idea. Obviously, the electoral college might reject some ideas just because they don't like them. 
6388	I would like to express my opininioun on keeping existance to the Electoral Collage.  
6389	The Electoral Collage Creates a dicided ground; as whell as, equal and justified representation. 
6390	Abolishment of the Electoral Collage would not give power to all states and, would highten potential for bias political leaders.  
6391	"Many argue that without the Electoral Collage equal power would be given to the people and that ""most people worry is the prosepct of a tie in the electoral vote""-source 2. "
6392	"In the example previous; you could dicide that since you were undicided or the party was undicided, you would not dine.  This could happen; however, the election should operate more on the the principals of the Electoral Collage to prevent this.  In example: ""The popular vote was very close in Florida [in 2012]; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes.""-source 3. "
6393	I think it is best to keep the Electoral college 
6394	because it wouldnt be fair to citizens 
6395	The U.S is supposably a free country , everyone has a right to vote , and freedom of speech ; if congress decides to not do electoral college , then it wouldnt be fair to citizens 
6396	I think community service is a very important requirement to have in schools. We all live in a community, so we all need to work as a community. 
6397	Lending a hand in some way would teach kids life lessons we would carry with us for the rest of our lives 
6398	Spending time in the community just a few times a month would teach hard work, how to work well with others, and how in order to be able to take you have to give back. Also how to accept differences, because everyone you meet wont be the same as you are, or think the same as you might. 
6399	I understand many students are not open to this idea or don't want to work out side of school. 
6400	Extra credit could be offered as a way to help motivate students 
6401	An extra point couldvery hour spend working in the community. high school credits could be given. maybe you could choose how much time a month you would spend doing community service. there could be a group service project so you could work with friends to make it seem like fun! 
6402	The teenage girl works on her homework while listening to music, she's singing along to the lyrics. She's an average girl with friends and an average grade. She like sports, she plays for the school lacrosse team and also the soccer team. She's happy with friends. Right now her grade is an A. Sometimes when she starts sports her grade will go down to a B or a  C but that's alright because there's always that guarantee that she's on the team, the team's best player. Where would the team be without her? They would definitely lose the majority of their games. 
6403	some of the teams would lose, 
6404	she would feel less included. 
6405	The team that is un-defeated always looks best for the school. The school who is invincible in this sport. 
6406	In a happy school, many people are more likely to get good grades. Studies show that when a student is in a happier or more welcoming environment tend to do better on tests, quizzes, and homework than children who are in an unhappy environment studying. If we take the student who is good at their sport and make them quit the team just because they have a bad grade, then we would be making a bad environment for the people who want the team to win and succeed, and that would affect how they learned and studied. This would not be good for the schools' public image because every school wants to look good. If we start to make our school look very bad just because a sports team lost which they thought would win but didn't, that might make many of our students feel bad and a bit disappointed. Students should be able to work in a healthy environment where they don't have bad sports teams to be ashamed of, but good ones to be proud of. 
6407	That one student who was kicked out of the team because she didn't have the grade B average to play on the sports team is now not accepted by any of her usual friends. She is sad and may become depressed. She used to have so many friends and now she has barely any. They all want to be friends with that new girl, who can maintain the right grade average and can play on the school sports team. Now the old girl feels lonely, no one should ever have to feel lonely because of a grade that kicked them off of the team. That is not the right kind. In a school teachers and principals should aim to have all of their students happy and fulfilled, mostly. 
6408	Remember that girl in the beginning of the letter, right now because of the new policy she is feeling extremely lonely, but only because of the new policy. She wants friends but doesn't know how to have them accept her because they used to be just fine fitting in. But since she got kicked out, people have been looking at her in disdain and not at all happy with her. They wanted her to win for them but, she couldn't maintain the right average so now people are blaming her. But it really isn't her fault. She was just trying to do her best so her team would win and she also tried really hard at grades, but she just couldn't make it. You could make it better for her, you could make her happier with more friends. Don't have the policy there to block her. Don't put a bar on so many students who would put all out to do well on their team, they just want to participate and be help their schools' reputation and public image. 
6409	I know as well as anyone else that sports are important in a child's life. Some students are incredibly gifted at sports, but others may not be. However, sports are a privilege, not a right. 
6410	Many schools have a policy that students must obtain at least a D average which is barely passing. I don't think that this should be so. Although I don't think that the policy at our school should be changed to obtaining a B average either. 
6411	Many students excel at sports while others at schooling. Although there are some students that exceed in both of these fields, obtaining a B average is rather hard for some students, especially with being in a sport. 
6412	Sports require team practices which are very exhausting on the body and the mind. Sometimes, when students get home from these practices, they don't have the energy for much. 
6413	I know you are thinking that school is more important that sports, and most parents would agree with you, 
6414	but without sports and exercise the childhood obesity level would skyrocket as it has in the last few years within adults.  
6415	In the 2012's election, obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes. Obama won cause of the electoral college. Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality in a state creates a lanslide electoral-vote victory in that state. So one good reason is the certainty of outcome. 
6416	While the idea is good, the execution of it can show a negative outcome. Students will show better academic growth in a physical class, 
6417	school gives them proper socialization 
6418	guarantees that every subject is learned in the right way 
6419	is almost always more affordable. 
6420	A big reason that a student should not take at-home courses is because they won't be properly socialized. 
6421	People, in general, need other people in their lives. Friends can help people find who they truly are on the inside. The easiest way to make friends as a kid is going to a public school. Not only does school help kids get friends, but it also teaches them how to interact with people in the real world. When a student is put through an online course at home, the easiness to make friends and interact with people goes away. In fact, home schooled kids have shown a lack of social skills, and are generally more shy than those who go to public school. Many have even developed psychological disorders such as depression, anxiety, and even a slightly warped perception of reality. Students would be much better off going to a public school and learning from there.  
6422	Another reason as to why students shouldn't take at-home courses is because it doesn't guarantee that subjects are learned properly. 
6423	The biggest reason why students shouldn't take at-home courses is because it's more affordable to go to public school. 
6424	If a student wishes to be home schooled, participate in at-home courses, or attend an online school, they will need to pay for the following: textbooks, the tuition to the online course, a computer, a calculator, certain teaching software, and possibly more. If a student wishes to go to public school, they will need to pay for: supplies. It's definitely more affordable to attend a public school rather than participate in at-home schooling. Many low income families can't afford it, and even some high income families aren't interested in wasting so much money when they can just put their kid through free public education. Putting a student through public school makes it easy and affordable for everyone. 
6425	At-home schooling is not beneficial for students, because they wont receive proper socialization, proper education, and it's generally less affordable. As controversial as this issue is, it's important to note that public schooling is the best option for everyone. Many leaders in the public school system work hard to make sure that a good learning environment is put in place for the youth of the county. A majority of a students best memories take place in public school. Parents need to make sure that their kids are receiving proper education in the right place: public school. 
6426	Educating the youth and next generation may take a drastic change. Distance learning, learning from home, should be a new way of education for students. In online learning, students would learn from home by taking courses online and using videos to educated themselves. Students would no longer be going to classrooms to learn which would actually be a good thing 
6427	it would stop social issues at school 
6428	allow students to go at their own pace 
6429	allow students to learn more information and use other sources.  
6430	Online learning would out right stop most social issues at school. 
6431	Bullying would be reduced for students since they're not forced to sit next to or even see a rude kid every day. Kids could only hang out and surround themselves with who they want to be around and don't have random seats or random partners and table mates. Having students not go into a classroom and all come together would also stop the spread of diseases and colds. Several schools have began online learning since the corona outbreak started to try and reduce the spread of that highly infectious disease. Another big social benefit, would be that kids can't be disruptive during classes and talk when the teacher is talking or talking to other kids and disrupt their learning envierment. Online learning would fix many have the social problems we have at school today. 
6432	Having students do online learning would allow for students to go at their own pace 
6433	In classrooms, the teacher chooses the pace at which they go at, and students have to follow it even if it's to fast for them and they get left behind. With online learning tho, it allows students to pause and rewind videos or even go back and understand something they didn't fully understand. Students could play videos again and again and review the videos as many times as they need to so they can understand, something that can't be done in a classroom. In classrooms, the teacher will just say things once, review it a little and explain, then move on. Online learning would allow all students to be able to fully understand and grasp a concept. 
6434	Online learning would allow students to learn more information and uses other sources to learn 
6435	Some kids who enjoy a concept, or just want to learn as much information about something as possible, are limited to how much the teach talks about it. With online learning students can explore the internet and other sources to find all sorts of information on a topic. In classrooms, teachers have a teaching method they use and just have to hope it works for everybody. In online learning, there is several ways of learning like watching a video, reading notes, and using a review game. Online learning would allow students to use each method and whatever they think helps them best they can use.  
6436	What is electoral college? The electoral college is a process, not a place. the founding fathers established it in the constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens. But it is also a bad thing because you help choose your states electors when you vote for president because when you vote for president because when you vote for your canadate you are actually voting for your canadates electors. 
6437	In conclusion, we have established our opinion on why the vote should be changed into a popular vote instead of the Electoral College due to a myriad of concepts, such as the disaster factor in 2000, why swing-states are unfair, the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote, just to reveal the tip of the iceberg in our arguments of understanding why the Electoral College is biased, irrational, and unfair. We have also covered the counterclaims and reasoned them with logic, reality, and true rationality of why the Electoral College shoud be abolished in the vote of the President of the United States of America. So, ask yourself as a state senator, who is truly in the hands of the final say for the President? 
6438	It'll prevent people from crashing into others and risking their lives 
6439	it'll decrease chances of trafic on express ways 
6440	One of them are getting sent to a different location. Just like G.P.S., you type in your address and sometimes it sends you somewhere you didn't want to go. A Driverless Car is like a driving G.P.S., it could also have a malfunctioning problem it could put your life at risk and others. 
6441	I think that is important to help because we never know if we will need help later on 
6442	And also i think that is important to do good things for the community sense we live and are the community 
6443	My idea is to help reading to little kids or even clean the school. i would like to help on something productive and on something that benefits all 
6444	the other thing that i personally think that is a good idea is to give food and water to people that do not have it. we can all donate food and gallons of water and then cook it and go to places where they really need the food and give it to them. 
6445	we can even go and buy cloth and give it to poor children that need it. i know that there is maybe more than 10 kids this really need cloth and food, i know because two years ago i went on vacation to Mexico and I was being really selfish. My dad took me to an orphanage and i got to see how the poor kids lived in that horrible place and I imagine how it wold be if i lived there. 
6446	from that i experienced that you should not care only about your self but care and about others too. that is the reason that i am willing to help because i know how people need help and in many ways that is why i want to help. i know it may be a hard job but it is worth all the work. I know that it feels good 
6447	During july 1976 it would have been winter on mars at the time. So that means the storms on mars could have casted a shadow. 
6448	It is simialr to some of the rock formations that we have on Earth. 
6449	Mr. and Mrs. Smith get prepared for the elections, which is held every four years on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. They're both really assured on who they are electing, Mr. Keen, the remarkable Republican canidate. Mr. Keen would most definitely operate in Mr. and Mrs. Smiths' favor, due to the fact that Keen offers a convinient medical insurance for they're family, opposes of abortion and is projecting sites for the unemployed individuals. Clearly, candidate Mr. Keen is a go for the Smiths'  family, but what if they're doomed of their vote not getting qualified due to the systems', such as the Electoral College? 
6450	There has been an ongoing conflict on the matter of the proper method to use when deciding on a president: use of the electoral college, or popular vote. I believe that this should be looked upon in greater concern than it currently is. Not only do many people question this arguement, but they feel uncomfortable by it too. 
6451	I believe the electoral college should be taken away from the process. 
6452	This is a more secure way of voting because the people of this nation feel as if whom ever they vote for may not actually be voted for by the electors. And this is, in no way, a good thing for the nation. 
6453	In the first place, the electoral college has its flaws, as anything would. But it's these flaws that the popular vote dosen't have that makes it a less valid way to decide something as important as presidency. 
6454	The electoral college has a seemingly fair way of deciding such a thing. 
6455	Each state is given a certain number of electors to represent its population (Ex. A small state such as Maryland would have less electors than California). 
6456	In one way, though rare, the electors may switch outlooks, and end up voting for the opposite candidate than whom they were voted, in turn, to vote for. Some even choose at random who they will vote for, regardless of who they were supposed to choose. Which then leads to the unfair decision for however many people he or she represented 
6457	Not only does it have the unfair use of electors, but it also is much more inprecise than popular voting methods. 
6458	"While the electoral college, in total, has only a couple hundred votes, it is less rational than the millions upon millions of people across the nation wanting to vote for whoever they wish with the use of the popular vote method. In '  The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong', the author explains, in paragraphs 4 and 5, how in the case of a tie in the electoral vote, that ""the Houses selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people."" Meaning that no matter what the people think, the president shall be chosen for them. And this is not the right way to elect the person designated to run the country "
6459	In my final point, as not to bore you with countless others, the use of popular vote has already surpassed the electoral college votes, 
6460	as such in the case of Nixon vs Kennedy, but has not proven enough to win the election. How is that fair, on any level? It shows how most people voted for one candidate, but then have that candidate lose because of the electoral college. Is that not reason enough, to show that people wanted a certain person as president, but because of the electoral college, didnt get as they wanted nor deserved? Not only is it shown in basic reasoning, but it is also shown in the numbers. The electoral college is an unjust way to elect presidents 
6461	I hope this is enough to change your view on the electoral college. It is not the fair way to let the people of this nation have the leader they want and and rightfully deserve. The use of popular vote is. It not only is a direct line of voting from the people, but all in all has a much fairer way to total the votes. A vote itself cannot possibly change from the point it is written to the point when it is accounted for, but an elector can. Don't allow this to happen the next term 
6462	I think that you should let kids play sports even if there grade is lower than a B average. There are people that need help and it is not fair to them if they are having trouble. There are three reasons why you should let students play sports without a B average. 
6463	There are students who may have joined a team and is not good at most subjects. He is not able to get them all done because he may have sports practice during the evening. 
6464	This can cause someone to come home late and not have time for homework. This will cause the student to have a bad grade on his progress report or report card. There can also be times when three different classes all have a major grade assignment due and they were all due at the same date. A player might not be home enough to do the project. They might also have a game that day. If they don't do there homework they wont be able to play, but if they don't come to a game they might get kicked off the team. So having a B average is like trying to win a losing battle for someone on a sports team. 
6465	The next reason is that all students have a unique specialty to a certain class. 
6466	They may be good at math but very bad at ELA. So if they get below a B average in that class they might get kicked off the team. Every person has his own abilities to do a certain thing or class. This is not fair to the people who are not good at everything. If they are not good at it that does not mean that they have to be kicked of the team.  
6467	If a person is having troubles in all of his classes a teacher cant only pay attention to him she has to look after the rest of the class. if they are at the back the teacher might not get to him because of all the people at the front. This way the student learns the minimum amount of knowledge he needs to pass the test or the quiz.  
6468	Well many people including me have a C average as our grade. But that doesn't mean you should punish us. We very well could be failing but were trying our very hardest to not be. Many things in the curriculum are very difficult for us to grasp, and understand, but that doesn't mean we aren't trying our very hardest to get our grades up. now this is not the case for every student, but in my case it is. I am having a great deal of difficulty in math right now, and that's because we are covering an area of material that I don't fully understand. I keep trying harder and harder everyday but the formulas and numbers just don't add to me. But I have had a great grade in this class all year until we got onto this subject 
6469	Many kids struggle with a subject that is difficult for them to learn. But we shouldn't punish them for it, just because they don't understand. 
6470	Now I can understand why you would change the policy for people who don't care about they're grade's and don't care to keep them up. 
6471	I think that if the policy stays the same then the students, you, the school, and the district will benefit from our curriculum and sport life. 
6472	In my opinoin I think we should absolutely keep the Electoral College system. 
6473	It's also easy and fast by killing two birds with one stone. 
6474	Having driverless cars can help us in many ways, including preventing crashes, 
6475	increased safety 
6476	However, driverless cars can also hinder us because technology can always fail, which could have catastrophic consequences. 
6477	Firstly, numerous crashes can be prevented. 
6478	The only forseeable problem with this is that it would be extremely expensive to redo all of the roads in the country. 
6479	Another reason that driverless cars are a good idea is that they improve people's safety. 
6480	As previously mentioed, the improved sensors will increase safety. There are all kinds of sensors that sense all different things such as the 3-D sensor, position estimating sensors, GPS reciever, and many more. all of these sensors can tell you if you're to close to the edge of the road, if you have a caar in your blindspot, if you're driving to fast, or to slow, the road conditions, and many other things. All of these sensors are so helpful in informing your car upon what to do to keep you and your family safe. Also, driverless cars take away distracted driving. Recently, a friend of mine recieved a text, picked up his phone to reply, and ran over a trash can. Imagine if that trash can had been a child, or a car containing you and your children. If he had a driverless car, then he would not have hit that trash can, in fact he would never run over anything again. Having driverless cars would infrease the safety factor for everyone. 
6481	On the other hand, having driverless cars could be a bad thing. 
6482	Technology could fail, leaving a catastrophic mess in its wake. The GPS system could misjudge a distance, causing the car to turn to soon, and run headlong into a building, killing people inside. Another thing is that the self-driving system could fail all together, leaving someone who doesn't know how to drive eiter stranded, or having to drive themselves. Therefore, driverless cars could be a bad thing. 
6483	Students should do community service, but community service should be done due to the goodness of someone's heart, not due to the force of someone's hand. 
6484	And if you try using community service as a punishment people wont listen. They wont listen, and they wont care. 
6485	The electoral college may seem like its a good idea to keep thngs going,but I think America should get rid of it. 
6486	According to this article, you dont really vote for the presedent you want, what you are really voting on is a state of elector, and if he gets elected he is the one who really gets to vote for the precedent 
6487	 Do you know that many students at this school have an average grade of a C?  Many of these such students are athletes at this school, and some of them participate in other extra-curricular activities as well.  
6488	the purpose of school is to learn and be successful, 
6489	time spent doing extra activities should be spent on work if they are not receiving good grades, 
6490	being able to participate in sports and other activities should be a reward for getting good grades.  
6491	If students are not focusing on their work and only on sports and other extra activities, then they are defeating the purpose of school.  Students who have a grade average of a C should focus more on learning in school before they worry about playing sports or joining other clubs at the school.  If the policy was changed so that students could only participate in sports or other activities if they had a grade average of a B or higher, then you would insure that they were coming to school and learning and staying on track to becoming successful later in their lives, not just coming to school to play sports or participate in extra-curricular activities. 
6492	In conclusion, changing the policy to participate in sports and other activities to having an average grade of a B instead of a C should be done.  This would require students to have to focus on the purpose of school, learning, before anything else.  Also, if students have a grade of a C, then they should have to spend the time they would use for sports or other activities to raise their grade.  Finally, being able to participate in sports and other activities should be a reward for working hard and receiving good grades.  As you can see, this is a policy change that should be made, as the opportunity to play sports and partake in other extra-curricular activities should be earned, not given. 
6493	I believe that we should change the election to the most popular vote instead of keeping the electorial college . The Electoral College was a good idea proposed by the Founding Fauthers , But i believe that it is time to kind of switch it up. 
6494	You should really consider these possibilities for the students future and how it would impact them when they go to collage, get a job, and have a family. I think you should only have people who have D's or below to not be able to play sports, but let the people who have a C and up be able to play sports. Just remember these ideas and how it could impact the future of those students and how they will live the rest of there lives wonder how to play that sport and teach there kid to learn that sport, but they wouldn't be able to do that if you do not change the grades to have them play sports cause of a grade rule that you put up. So let those kids with a C average play sports. 
6495	Community work never hurts, Its something that would be good for our school. 
6496	It s something that others will appreciate and when your done not just make you feel good because you helped someone but also make the ones you helped feel good. 
6497	Some may say that's its a waste of time and they could be out having fun with there friends or going to parties and what not. 
6498	But if they had to go more things would get done around the town because they would be helping. 
6499	When you get older in life and you need a job or you want this collage to want you, then having community service will look good on your application for the collage/job 
6500	and they will think ''Well they seem to care about there town to help out this much '' and by them knowing that you did this to help you will look good to them. Which in the long shot you will look better, then some of the others. Not just helping you out with collage or a job but skills in life. You might have learned something while doing your community service that helps you out when in a tough predicament that you come across. 
6501	I did community service a couple of times and i certainly learned new skills. I helped out elder and cleaned beaches it was fun to me and I believe that it would be good for our school to require community service not just for the town and people but for themselves to feel personal pride in that they did for there community and themselves. It would be a great thing to do for our school. 
6502	In the year 2000, this was proved, Gore had received more popular votes than Bush, yet fewer electoral votes. ''It is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote.'' The section of the nation that believes the Electoral College is unfair believes this because they assume all the power is in this system's hands 
6503	Yet they are mistaken because clearly our popular vote can override this system if necessary. Though it is very rare most will argue, the fact that it is possible to not allow the Electoral College to take control of our government proves that the power is really all in the hands of the citizens. Clearly, the ''unfair'' picture most perceive is largely mistaken 
6504	To conclude, our country is based off of fair rules and systems, one of them being the Electoral College. It is fair because it does not have full power, the right amount of power is applied to each state, and it produces a clear winner. ''Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an electio.''    
6505	It's the Tuesday after the first Monday in November, can you guess what it is? It's election day! Every four years, nearly every person in America will vote to choose a new President, or do we? Yes, we live in a democracy where we can vote for who runs out country, but do we really make the descision? The Electoral College is a phase where electors, of a candidate running for president, come together and decide for who is the President, Vice President, and include the countings of the electoral votes from Congress. The person who runs for President has a select group of people known as electors, which are typically chosen by that person's political party 
6506	Is this who we really vote for, and is it fair? This should be eradicated. 
6507	By using the Electoral College, we don't directly vote for our own President. We vote for his/her's electors. It's them who really choose who leads us, not us 
6508	"In ""What Is the Electoral College?"" it states that ""...when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors,"" meaning we aren't actually voting for a President, just his/her's electors. It could literally be anybody, not holding public office. This is not a direct way for us to vote for who makes the descisions around here. In ""Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,"" it claims that ""...over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" Sixty percent said that! That's incredible. "
6509	"Sometimes voters could be discombabulated about who it is they are voting for. Sometimes voters can't control who the electors vote for. This is both confusing and frustrating for anyone who thinks they voted for someone great, but the electors change that. In ""Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,"" it says that ""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president."", meaning that we don't choose for ourselves, they do. "
6510	"Some could say ""its anarchy"", or that ""its not democratic"", which could be true "
6511	"In ""In defense of the Electoral College...,"" it states that ""But each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee...however it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote."" This means that even though you vote for a person, it's probably a fifty-fifty chance your person will win "
6512	It does also help release the stress of worrying about a run-off election, and avoids the problem where no candidate receives a majority of votes that has been cast.  
6513	The Electoral College is not the best way to vote in our beautiful country. It can be decieving and confusing. Though it may have one or two advantages, the list of things that can go wrong with it are of plenty. It is unfair, and could turn nasty. It should be abolished. Make America more equal.    
6514	I am thinking about the policies for using cell phones at school. Since many students are using phones, they will of course want to use it at school. I surely know that all of the students would want Policy One, since it enables them to use their cell phones at break time. 
6515	Every four years, citizens of the United States ages eighteen and up, gather at local voting locations to elect the President, our government leader. From Washington to Obama we have always elected our leaders as such. The Constitution has given us our way to vote- the Electoral College. This process, of course, consists of our 538 electors, the place where they meet to vote, and the counting of said votes. But how effective is this process? 
6516	"According to a poll taken in 2000, 60% of voters would rather direct voting over the current system. With the current ""  winner-take-all  "" concept in most all states except Maine and Nebraska, many people find that even if 45% of all the votes in the state are for one party, all of the votes go to the opposition. Citizens may as well not even vote under this standard if they wont even be represented. "
6517	Although not one vote will decide an election if we had direct voting, many single votes can. 
6518	Take the 1.4 out of 3 million people in California who voted one way and got all their votes thrown the other because of the other 1.6 million people. With that 1.4 million, mixed with tons of thousands of voters, one party may actually win the election rather then the canidate who would have won with the Electoral College process. For example, in 2000, George W. Bush won the election and most of the Electoral College votes. However ,  Al Gore got the most individual votes. How can that be fair at all? 
6519	"When ""we the people"" vote for the president, we are not actually doing what we have come to believe. In reality, we are actually voting for representatives called  Electors to vote for the canidate. "
6520	These electors cast their vote depending on the votes that we (you and I), cast. These electors that we choose are generally very trustworthy and reliable, being the reasons we choose these government officials to elect our government leaders. Sadly, however, not everybody is who they say they are, as we all have flaws and sins; occasionally one of these electors will be unfaithful and vote for the canidate they deem fit, instead of who we have chosen ourselves. Although this is rare, the possibilities would be negated completely if we simply had direct, individual voting. 
6521	I do not think that students should be required to perform community service. I do think that it should be highly recommended though. 
6522	I think it should be recommended and not forced because some students actually do not have the time to perform community service. 
6523	Say your friend was on the school basketball team and he was part of the Spanish honor society, school would end at three he would have to go to a Spanish honor society meeting from three until four thirty then he would need a to do his homework for two hours then he would have a basketball game at six, then he would need to eat dinner when he got home and eight thirty and by then he would be too exhausted to even move let alone perform community service and he would have to repeat this every day until the weekend which he will need to sleep and do homework and also relax from a tough week 
6524	on the other hand there are the people who go home blow off their homework and either hang out with friends or play video games, 
6525	it would be unfair if the people who are working constantly their whole week have to then perform community service after their long and hard week behind and a new one imminently coming. while it is completely fair for the slacking and un working people to take time out of their day to help their community 
6526	Many of the smart phones of these modern times are fascinatingly convenient and impressive. One of the more popular phone called the iphone, has: a g. p. s. system, go on the internet, text call and I.M. all at the same time and has much as 16 gigga bites with way more features than that. Most phones can do that as well even more, some people depend on their or PDA because their plans, schedules connections with people all over the world is on their device. Although students come to school to gain an education, the can't focus and do that correctly with cell phone distracting them 
6527	If the students are detracted form what they need to do, that eventually leads to bad grades, not a good job and worse lack of education, and with these present days, it is mandatory to have a good education. 
6528	"Now you may be in favor of the Electoral College but sir I'm here to change you mind. Why are so many people in favor of this process maybe because they can guzzle up your money , my money  OUR  money . I say lets go with popular vote not some elector in a monkey suit. We let them have a ""winner-take-all"" system as stated in paragraph 7 from an excerpt from "" What Is The Electoral College "". Why do we need make the District of Columbia like their own state , why should we go threw all the hassel of putting certain numbers of electors for each state when we can just go with popular vote. The vote we have. "
6529	"The Electoral college can be greatly described as a pedigree. The Electoral College being around for so long as the time of our founding fathers- quite a long time, now having doubts? ""The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anaschornism,"". Can't say that anyone shouldn't be surprised just like anything in this life everything comes to an end at some point "
6530	One big milestone in a person's teenage years is when they have to take a driver's test to get their license. Many people often become stressed behind the wheel during the driver's test because they are afraid of making mistakes. The people of our generation are just as nervous about these test as our older generations but what if that were to change in the future? What if, instead of driving cars where we have to be driving one hundred percent of the time, there were cars out there that allowed the car to do the driving for us? 
6531	"Many companies have been working on the idea of ""driverless cars"" in hopes that they will reshape the whole concept of driving. However, that does not mean they are a good thing. Driverless cars should not be used in the future "
6532	"As these driverless cars are being invented, they allow drivers to meerly sit back in the drivers seat and enjoy the road. Sitting for thirty minutes in a car will not be enough to satisfy the boredom of some people. There are people out there who can not deal with sitting in one place for a few minutes and have to do something to keep them busy. Therefore, their focus could easily move to something else other than the road, like a fellow passenger or at the scenery around them. Driverless cars are not entirely driverless. As said in the article, ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills such as navigating through work zones and around accidents. This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires."" What if the driver is not prepared to take over when the situation requires? These new cars may have features of notifying an individual when they need to take over but if they are not ready because they were focused on something else, then the results could be disastirous. This is why it takes away focus from drivers. "
6533	"Many teenagers today have to take drivers ed classes as they attempt to obtain a license from the BMV. But what would future generation drivers have to go through for their driving exams if we have driverless cars. As stated before, driverless cars aren't entirely driverless. The newer generations still have to learn to basics of driving even if they will be driving in a driverless car in the future. If this does not happen, then they could be in trouble if their driverless cars malfunction or they are forced to drive a regular car instead. The future generations will probably not know about the driving basics because they will think they are too far advanced for it. For example, not many people know how to drive ""stick"" or even know what that means even though it was vital for driving long ago. If someone were to enter a car that needed that kind of function, they would not know what to do. And the same thing applies to future generations if they would not know the driving basics. "
6534	"According to the article, ""Presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control ata all times. As a result, in most states it is illegal even to test computer-driven cars."" With the government concerned about the safety of a driver behind the wheel, they will not allow driverless cars on the roads. The safety of the people is more important than to advancement of technology. Until the driverless cars have been updated to the time where they are safe for everyone, there is no way that driverless cars will be seen on the roads with regular cars for quite some time. This is why driverless vehicles are against the law in some states. "
6535	In conclusion, driverless cars should not be used in the future because they take away the driver's focus, the future generations need to learn about the driving basics that we use today, and it is illegal to use computer-driven cars. Of course, in the future, new technology will arise to give people more mobility and ways of transportation but that will not happen until everyone is safe. Many individuals are in car crashes every year from lack of focus on the road. Driverless cars can add to this problem just like any other and until we have to tools necessary to ensure they safety of the people using driverless cars, there is no way that they will be seen among the streets. 
6536	Our country would be much better off if we kept the electoral college, rather than choosing the president just based on the popular vote. 
6537	Driverless cars, although dangerous in a multitude of ways, have uses that far excede any dangers. It is said that in order to progress in life you must first take steps back. Although these driverless cars are a step forward in technology, they can be seen as a being a step backward because of the dangers that persist. In reality, these dangers are just a learning curve to arguably one of the most revolutionary inventions in the last decade, driverless cars. 
6538	they are sought after, 
6539	the technology is available, 
6540	they are getting safer with time. 
6541	"The human has drempt of the flying car for generations, and finaly the idea is fesable. The text referances Google cofounder Sergey Brin, and how he ""envisions a future with a public transportation system where fleets of driverless cars form a public-transport taxi system,"" (Paragraph 1). Although this is just the dream of one man, millions more people believe that driverless cars are the key to the future. These millions of other people have drempt for driverless cars, and many times their fathers did also. Knowing this, many people will want to get their hands on this new technology that is a driverless car. Making the development of these cars very positive becasue the population will want and has wanted driverless cars for decades. Driverless cars have been a thing of fiction for so many people for so long, but now these cars are a reality. "
6542	"Driverless cars were always thought to be a thing of the past, but the reality is that they are a thing of the present and have been for many years. The writing points out that, "" Google has had cars that could drive independently under specific conditions since 2009."" (Paragraph 2). While many people view driverless cars as a thing of the future, Google has formed them to be a thing of the now. This technology, that has been sought after for generations, is now readaly available. It was even said that Tesla has released plans to come out with a car capable of driving on autopilot 90 percent of the time in 2016. (Paragraph 10). Knowing that these cars are being released this year is over the top of many peoples head, and shows that the development of these cars is indeed helpful. Knowing that the technology is already out in the world shows that the development of these cars grow every single day. This growth will positivly effect the automotive industry, and keep the people making these cars coming out with new and safe versions of these driverless cars. "
6543	"This safety is both for the environment, and most importantly for the drivers of these cars. Indeed, these cars are as safe as they ever will be. We are reminded of the safety of these cars when paragraph eight reminds us that, ""In this way, the in-car system is actually a saftey feature, and saftey is a big concern,"" Not only is the in-car heads-up display a safty feature as it talks about, but reminds us that saftey is the biggest concern that the companies have. This paragraph even mentions how some of the ""fun"" features are for the saftey of the driver, mainly to keep them awake and alert at the wheel even if they are not the drivers. Knowing that saftey is one of the bigest concerns that the companies have for these cars sould be settling because consumers know that the automated cars that they buy would be in top conditions and have a multitude of features that keep both themselves and the passangers safe. One of the many features mentioned was the voice or even a vibrating chair to signal when the car needs a human to control the driving because the road needs the expertise of a human driver. Because these cars are safe, their development is very positive. "
6544	The development of these driverless cars should be continued because they are sought after by many people, the technology is available and is being worked on, and these cars are safe and getting safer. By developing these tests, the companies are creating a technology that, to millions of people, is still only a dream. The complications that these cars may have is a minute detail in the ever evolving spectrum that is the saftey of these cars for the people inside an out. Driverless cars are no longer a thing of the future but make up our present in every way imaginable. 
6545	Is distance learning through video and online conferencing a great and beneficial way for students to learn from home or does it hinder one's chances of actually learning and having a good learning experience? Video conferencing is widely used in today's society as technology has boosted and upgraded. People often use video conferencing as a means to chat, have meetings and most importantly, educational purposes such as having class online. Many may claim that video conferencing through distance learning is a good thing because it gives students adequate time to spend time with family and have time for their jobs as well while taking classes online 
6546	Firstly, video conferencing with distance learning from home is not advisable and great because students may prefer that they have a face to face talk with a teacher. 
6547	In cases where a student may not understand something, having to physically be there in a school building and ask a question, the teacher can demonstrate carefully and step by step till the student is able to get a grasp of what is being taught and questions are clarified. Some students just prefer having the need to be around to understand, it makes it better for them. Whereas, when students are far away and learning through a video conference or online, it may be harder to understand because demonstrations may be a little unclear through a video. when there is a need for a question, doing classes online there's no one to ask at times so students have to go the extra mile of looking into researches, YouTube videos, etc before they're able to understand. something which waste time from their studies and brings conflict. Video conferencing is not advisable and taking classes may be better face to face which brings peace and makes things better. 
6548	Secondly, video conferencing with distance learning from home is not advisable and great because it brings distractions 
6549	Taking classes online and learning from home brings unwanted distractions such as having the need to sleep, watching TV, playing games and having to take care of kids while doing class at the same time. With these distractions, students are not able to get their classes and work done, they're not able to stay focused on their task which can result in bad grades and affect one's education. This can eventually lead to depression and failure which is very sad and dangerous and needs to be taken seriously. A student may even struggle to get their grades up having to constantly deal with these distractions while juggling classes online. Video conferencing is not great and students should go to a school building and study to best eliminate any possible distractions to learn. 
6550	Thirdly, video conferencing with distance learning is not advisable and great because it promotes laziness and affects health. 
6551	some students that often take online courses may get bored because they're constantly staring at a screen, so taking online classes starts to get boring for them and they start to get lazy and refrain from doing their work, students do that because they're constantly staring at a screen which starts to give eye problems. sitting behind a screen for prolonged hours causes problems for the eyes such as watery eyes and pain in the eye, sometimes eye twitches which make learning frustrating. So as a result, students stop doing their work. Whereas in a school building, students are not always looking at screens but white boards also which is less harmful to the eyes. Students are not lazy because classes ring from bell to bell, so students are always up and moving rather that sitting behind a computer all day. It's best to go to school without being lazy and staying healthy rather than using a video conference to learn. 
6552	In conclusion, video conferencing and taking online classes with distance learning is not the best thing for students, because of the conflict and problems that come with it. It can greatly affect a student's education. With online classes, students may be faced with distractions which can cause them to stay off task and bring down their grades leading to frustration and depression. This can lead to suicidal thoughts and drain a student's life. Health is very important, and it is necessary that our bodies should be healthy. Taking online courses can have a negative and tragic effect on a student's body leading to eye problems, the eye being a very important body part. This may eventually let the student become unproductive and lazy. Also many students prefer having a face to face teaching session to make learning more efficient and better to understand overall. Students across the world should be able to learn the importance of physically being in school where there's plenty of teachers and resources around. Being in school is very important and can greatly benefit students. Technological advancements in the modern world is also very important and have been beneficial in helping with education and making education better. But students should not let the technology of today make them lazy and they should be willing to work hard and diligently.                      
6553	Video-games, electronics, high functioning computers, wireless technology and so much more has become very popular in modern day society. Even schools have started to take a more technological approach to teaching. Many schools are offering new methods of teaching that include online courses such as video conferences 
6554	personal connections with teachers 
6555	social skills. 
6556	Attending school from home would not be beneficial because there would be a lack of guidance 
6557	A well known student at Generic_School, with above average grades, had chosen to take Physical Education online. Due to the unfamiliar feeling of the absence of a teacher in her presence, she received a D in the course. This shows that without having a teacher in one's physical presence, it is very easy to get lost. Compared to attending a real high school, online classes have less resources in times of confusion. Real high schools have thousands of students and near a hundred teachers who may help preventing one from getting lost, while virtual classes have maybe fifteen reliable sources. 
6558	Another exaple of this is a student who had moved to Virginia all the way from India that had trouble transferring their Algebra 2 credits and was forced to retake the class online in order to graduate, although previously receiving an A in the class in India. He had phenomenal work habits, but the technology confused him and although he understood the content, failed the course because of lack of guidance with technology. This is proof that not having anyone to help in means of technology or clarity, prevents one from full potential. Guidance is very essential to one's success, whether it be for clarity or not understanding how to operate advanced technology. Online courses open more problems than they solve because of simple misunderstandings that could be solved with personal guidance. 
6559	Another explanation of why attending school from home would not be beneficial is because there is no personal connections with teachers 
6560	"In the book, ""The Great Gatsby,"" Nick was able to find a new found trust for John upon receiving the information that they attended the same war together. This shows how John shifted from some mysterious guy to a possible trusted friend, all because of a personal connection. Schools offer this same opportunity with students and teachers, but online classes eliminate this opportunity. The online connection of a student and teacher is significantly reduced due to never seeing them or having any personal interactions "
6561	A popular story at Generic_School, is one of a student who had a below average GPA, but had a fantastic relationship with his Business teacher. He was accepted into a prestigious Ivy league school and after calling them, he found out he was accepted based off of his teacher recommendation. This story shows how having personal relationships with teachers is very beneficial. An online course teacher does not have this same bond as an in-school teacher, and this represents one of the many possible cons. Overall, relationships with teachers has a very crucial and important role in a students life. 
6562	The final reason that attending school from home is not beneficial is that their would be a loss of social skills that a student learns while being in school. 
6563	"One example of this is ""Impractical Jokers,"" which is a show of four life-long friends who met in high school, and compete to do extreme and comical activities in public. This show shows us that these four friends developed social skills in high school and became closer due through school. If any of those guys took online classes instead, the chances of them being friends still in their forties would not be as high. Attending school in person is very important because it forces people to be social and make friends and not hide behind a computer, which a virtual class would allow. "
6564	Another example of this is Clemson's star quarterback, Trevor Lawrence. Him and his girlfriend have been together for years since high school, and he is now one year from entering the NFL. If he had chosen to attend classes from home instead, he would most likely not be with, or even know his current girlfriend. This shows that attending a real school is very beneficial, especially in the social aspect. Creating social skills and developing character is very important to do at a young age, and is difficult to do so while attending a class behind a computer monitor. 
6565	Overall, attending classes from home does not benefit students in the long run because there is an absence of guidance, personal connections with teachers, and social skills. All of these ideas are critical in a teenagers life and taking online classes prevents this. Schools should steer away from this new way of teaching and should attempt to maintain the current standards of teaching. The education of a student is very important, and the school system should do everything in its capability to improve it.           
6566	There is no need to change the school's policy so that students with a B average or above may be the only ones aloud to participate in sports and other school activities. Granted, students must keep up with their school work, but level of book smarts does not effect the qualities for sports or other activities. 
6567	Sports are based on levels of fitness, not brain activity. 
6568	If a student excels in a sport, he or she should not be limited to access of achieving their goals in this sport because they are not at a high academic level. Limiting their ability to participate in what they excel in can take away many opportunities. For example, one of your students has the skill to play on a professional sports team, but unfortunately they are not allowed to participate in sports at school because they have a C average. A C average today in math class doesn't determine their future as a MVP. 
6569	Taking a student out of sports and other activities will not promise higher grades. 
6570	Some students have learning disabilities that prevent them from learning to the standard that reaches a B average or above. Sports and other activities can stimulate the mind and actually help with learning. By allowing the students to participate in both sports and class they have a more likely chance to improve in both. 
6571	I understand that one believes that by not allowing students to participate in sports or other activities will limit their focus to school work, therefore allowing more time towards education 
6572	Still, to live a healthy and well-rounded life, one must have the options to participate in activities other than school work. 
6573	"It's just a rock, a plain, thousands of years old, heap of rock. The End, no ""Ifs, ands, or buts"", there is evidence saying that this is just a mesa, a landform, we have picture proof of it. "
6574	"Well, that point can actually be rebuted as well, because of what Jim Garvin, the chief scientist for NASA's Mars Exploration Program, said, ""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixer size,"" he added. ""So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"". Factually that should be the end of it, it was a clear picture, that was enhanced for farther detail, on a clear day, with a high resolution camera. "
6575	I agree with the change in the policy. Maintaining a grade B average should not be too hard if you have a C average at the time. 
6576	students need to consider these extra curricular activities as privileges from working hard. 
6577	The sports activities should be earned by putting forth best effort in your education. If students like sports and extracurricular activities, then they should think more about what they must do to participate in them. students need to think about their options first. Its sort of like cause an effect. If students get lower than a B average then it effects their chances of participating in extracurricular activities. Students must think about the consequences of their own mistakes. Just like many famous people today who act in movies and on television, they also had to work hard. I hard work is put into what you are trying to pursue then it can be accomplished or obtained. You just have to earn it. No one is just given anything in life. Those people earn what they have. 
6578	Changing the policy might influence more students who show great enthusiasm towards sports and other activities, to reach for higher standards because its something they want. 
6579	More students might get better grades because they have something to work for. This could open up students to a new way of learning. Students might notice that they have done so well just to play sports, that they might as well keep it up. More parents will be proud and students will get what they want. Students will learn that they must work hard to earn something. This could help them carry on in their lives an successful people. Just one situation can lead to great things. This will teach students to value hard work and dedication when trying to pursue a goal or dream. More students might understand why their parents work so hard everyday to support them. Parents are working hard to pursue their goal of raising a child that will succeed in life. 
6580	Many people when they vote for example, a democratic representative, they expect the democratic representative to vote for the democratic canadate for president.  Unfortununtly, sometimes that is not the case.  The democratic representative will end up voting for the Republican canadate for president.  This issue occurs many times in the Electoral College which is why people are having second thoughts about the Electoral College and wanting to eliminate it so that they can directly vote for the president or vice president they want and think will improve our country more. 
6581	I beleive that we should get rid of the Electoral College. It may have been good and all back in the old days, but the Electoral College does not many voters the passion to vote today. 
6582	beacuse it will encourage more people to vote 
6583	it is on the brink of catastrophe. 
6584	To begin with, if we get rid of the Electoral College it will encourage more people to vote for Presidident. 
6585	For example, as seen in the article, Republicans in California realize that their vote does not matter because Democrats tend to dominate in that state. The same can be said for Democrats in Texas who beleive their vote does not matter because Republicans dominate in that state. However, if the U.S had a popular vote, voters may think that there vote may mean more and will be encouraged to go out and vote for the President. 
6586	On the other hand, you may argue that the Electoral College helps America have a better President beacuse in order to win you must do so in all regions of the country. 
6587	For example, Mitt Romney won pretty much the whole south region back in 2012 but did not become President because he did not gather enough Electoral Votes. Barack Obama had a more widspread tally of votes. But he counter to that he did win California which gave him 55 extra votes. 
6588	In conclusion, we should abolish the Electoral College in order to encourage more people to vote and to stop a catastrophe that is bound to happen soon. Acorrding to a Gallup poll done in 2000, over 60% over the American people would rather have a popular vote. This just prooves that the Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational.  
6589	I think community service is a very good and helpful thing for the community, but I do not think students should be required to do community service. 
6590	When students do community service voluntarily they usually feel proud of themselves after they are done 
6591	They know they have helped the community and this gives them a sense of accomplishment. If community service was required in school, students that did community service by choice anyway will not feel accomplished after doing community service if they had to do it. This takes away the feeling of accomplishment, and discourages students that used to do community service to do community service by choice anymore. Then all students will probably only do the bare minimum and it will not be helping the community since barely any people will do community service. 
6592	On the other hand, the students who thought community service was a waste of time, are probably students who do not do their homework from school anyway, so they will probably not even do the community service if it is required 
6593	So by adding community service as a requirement to school, it is not really helping the community, because just a few more people will be doing community service, and most of the people doing the service will not feel any sense of accomplishment. Also, the people who used to do community service will probably lessen their amounts of community service because it will not make them feel proud, so they would feel they are just doing extra for no reason. 
6594	Community service is a very good thing to do, but I really feel that making it a school requirement will decrease the amounts of community service that is being done by students. As I stated before, requiring community service in schools will make community service stop being an activity that students enjoy, and so they will stop liking to do community service; which will have a bad effect on themselves and the community.  
6595	it would be very beneficial for our school to participate in community service 
6596	Some of the activities that would easily be assessed are cleaning up trash 
6597	caring for the elderly. 
6598	because it can almost be treated like a field trip where students will be brought to a designated location where clean up is necessary and the students will clean up the roads and fields to have better land and less global warming because of the littered trash.  This form of community service would be easy because it would take less than two hours, so the kids can leave the school and come back in the blink of an eye.  
6599	I believe this would be easy but a little more difficult to plan the picking up trash because the students will need to leave and come back from the homes of the elderly at different times so most if not all of the elderly citizens of our community can be helped and cared by the students at SCHOOL_NAME.  In a result there would be less fatalities of the elderly by falling because of the students with them to help care for them. 
6600	In Conclusion, I believe I will soon be able to see the day where our community is safe, where there is no global warming happening, where the streets and fields of our community are free of debris and the elderly are not frightened of getting too old where it is hard to see or walk because they will have children to rely on. 
6601	I think its unfair to mandate community service. 
6602	but for some people it just takes to much time! 
6603	If we had more time on our hand then i would be all for community service, but don't have a lot of time to do anything after school. 
6604	Our teachers give us too much home work and not enough time to do it all and now if it becomes mandatory to do community service no one will have any time to do anything but homework and community service. That is unfair and unjust taking a way our personal time. Before the only time i had to myself was sleeping, and now i will have to spend that picking up trash. Or reading to the blind. Or tutor elementary school students. Or spending my time with old people that have Alzheimer's disease, who can even remember the last time they went to the bath room. That is a court sentence, not what you do for school. 
6605	I think this is the correct option because, while at school a student's mind should be on the work he or she has been assigned and the job of keeping his/her grades up. 
6606	Cellular devices are a distraction from school work and assignments they keep a student occupied with social activities and interaction rather then the grades and assignments that the student has been assigned. Also a cell phone is not only a distraction for students but a hazard. Imagine if you will how hard it is carrying all your books and other school related items without distraction then amagin your cell phone going off in your pocket, of course you answer it but while pulling the phone from your pocket you trip and fall. it is much easer to fall and drop books or food while talking on a cell phone. 
6607	Student should be allowed to keep there phones on their person as long as they are turned off at all times during a regular school day. this then creates the problem of students texting during school hours and class so I propose that students who are caught texting or using the cell phone during school our not in the case of an emergency should have there phones took away for a set amount of time. much like if a student does something wrong he/she is punished with a certain amount of time. 
6608	if you live in a mostly Democratic state as a Republican, your vote is regarded as nothing, and you would have no reason to vote in the electoral college, instead of throwing your vote into the entire mass of the united states, where it has a chance to even slightly influence the vote. 
6609	Also, since larger states are given more attention, due to the all-or-nothing attitude of most states, other states are given less information and are forced to make more wild guesses than votes, a result of having less information. 
6610	"When the idea of the Electoral College was introduced, the telegraph was still pretty hot technology. All votes would be counted by hand by an impartial court, counting off the vote of every single person individually, out of perhaps more than a million voters. Instead of this, each state would record their own numbers and dispatch a group of electors, who could not be influenced away from their vote, while sending a horseman or a few across the hundreds of miles of U.S. territory with a few little scraps of paper with votes on it would be impractical and dangerous. bags could be lost, a rider could have an accident, entire counties would be unaccouted for. The Electoral College was a nessecity as well as a stroke of genius, and I applaud the man who thought of it. However, this was when the telegraph was a stroke of genius, too. Now we have a cell phone the size of a notecard that can store thousands or millions of votes alone. We have processors that can count the number of people that like apples versus oranges and come out with a percentage, verdict, reciept, and the best bussines option as soon as the numbers are input, as soon as we push that little blue ""Enter"" button. We can send the votes through the air in the billions, without as much as wires to conduct them. there is little or no possibility of tampering or miscommunication, and there are records to back up and correct every single little error. it is much smarter, safer, and more accurate to initiate a simple counting program on the computer, with each individual terminal sending all of it's results and information to a higher terminal until all of the information is scored, backed up, double checked, counted, percentaged, and a final verdict is reached. This can even be done in a way to run the information separately to different computers, to minimize tampering. "
6611	The electoral college is obsolete, a small parasite of politicians who just dont want this to end. we dont still use the telegraph, do we? 
6612	The electoral college is not only obsolete, unnesessary and parasitic, but also unfair to many voters. The main ways this unfairness can be identified are extreme, and each really deserve a paragraph of their own. Let us imagine a scenario: a democrat lives in a mostly republican state 
6613	"He goes to vote. His vote is passed along, checked off, and placed aside for a time. When all of the votes are in, the republican votes outweigh the democrats. Now, our democrat's vote, his wife's vote, the democratic guy who works at 7-11 down the street's vote, Joe's vote, Bob's vote, Billy's vote, ""That girl Suzie's"" vote and ALL THE DEMOCRATIC VOTES IN THE STATE are all, essentially, thrown into the furnace, and will do so next election, the election after, and essentially every mostly republican election after that. In a popular vote without the barrier of the Electoral College, all those votes would flow into the pile for whichever canidate they voted for. Then the pile would be counted, divided into the total votes, and percentaged. then, at lest the votes could count for SOMETHING, other than a waste of time. "
6614	But wait! there's more. Most states have an all-or-nothing ideal, meaning if politician A got 51% of the votes in California, while politician B still got 49%, Politician A gets 55 votes in the Electoral College, while politician B gets squat. This does not represent the best interests of many of the people in that state. this is unfair 
6615	"It also means that larger states have the advantage, because they get more votes, like California (55), Texas (38), and Florida (29), while smaller states get less, such as Alaska (3), Rhode Island (3), and Hawaii (4). Just to add insult to injury, this means that larger states are more fought over by politicians, leaving smaller states practically ignored. This is unfair to people in the Dakotas or Montana have no information to base their votes on, instead just picking a canidate by mainly party affiliation. the biggest political battles are in fact fought over the biggest states, in the forms of advertisements and propaganda. Although the propaganda is truely just that: propaganda, there is some truth in them, and the voters in bigger states are more well versed in the political and practical advantages of one canidate over the other. Article 3, while defending the Electoral College, in fact condems itself, by saying that voters in so called ""swing states,"" where there is no true dominant party, are likely to be given the most information on the canidates as they battle over who will get that state's votes in the college. The same thing can be said for the bigger states, because neither politician can really afford to let the other gain the upper hand in that state. Therefore smaller states, or states that are basicly marooned on one party are ignored or disregarded as worthless and unattainable in any case, so they widthold information from them, forcing them to vote blindly in favor of whichever party they choose, which votes may be discarded anyway. With an uncensored popular vote, the political canidates will be forced to advertise for all of the united states, instead of just the bigger or indevisive states. this will also remove all of the unfair advantages from the larger states, including more information as well as an unfairly weighted voting system. "
6616	In conclusion, the electoral college was the most efficient and sucessful way to vote, back in the 1700-1800. However, with current communication and transportation technologies, the College has become obsolete, to the point where it should be buried at a crossroads with a stake through it's heart. It is unfair, biased, impractical, and just overall worthless. We should put our newfound technology and knowledge to use and do away with the electoral College, once and for all.    
6617	It does look like it could be from another living organism, but it's just a rock on the planet. In our newest image of the rock, it turns out that the face has dissapered. There is no evidence of this being created by aliens, rather it was created by wind and water that has been found on Mars. The reason you might believe that this was indeed aliens, might be the fact that the news has blown it out of poportion. It's just the rock that had some interesting shadows and holes that made it look like a human face. 
6618	In addition; is good to come at the school but for the senior students is more preferable to take classes in online beause we begin to work in restaurants or another places 
6619	The Electoral College is used in the United States to elect a president, yet it is higly debated over whether it is needed or not. The Electoral College was founded to compromise the election of a president between the people and Congress, to try to avoid problems between both parties. Many people allign themselves with one side to argue that it is needed to eliminate unfair advantages, or that it is not needed because it doesn't give the people the power to elect their president. This brings up disputes and controversy especially in situations that give evidence to support both cases, such as the 2000 presidential election between Al Gore and George Bush. 
6620	it provides a fair representation and campaign for all regions 
6621	allows votes from states with fewer population numbers to have significance 
6622	avoids the issue of trying to determine the president when neither receives the majority vote 
6623	To begin with, the Electoral College should be in use because it provides fair representation for all the states involved in the election. 
6624	"The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal."" ""This is a desireable result because a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president."" This shows that it is beneficial because it makes a candidate who has only regional appeal, have to work harder in other states to show that he would be fair to all states, not just the ones that support him. Furthermore, it allows for massive regional advantages, like the South, mean nothing because they would still have to convince the North to vote for them. "
6625	The opposing side might argue that if a candidate has regional appeal, they should just let that win them the election 
6626	but a successful president should be able to sway the whole country into voting for him, not just a certain region. Thus, showing that regional advantages prove meaningless with the Electoral College, making it less unfair to other regions. 
6627	In addition, the Electoral College eliminates the unfair advangate of having a bigger state, allowing smaller states to have a significance in the election 
6628	"The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution."" This shows that large states can sway the whole election, while small states don't make a dent on it, without the Electoral College in place. Thus, using it allows smaller states' votes to matter in the election, while eliminating large states' advantage over them "
6629	People might claim that large states deserve more representation because more people live in them 
6630	"this doesn't preserve the equality for other smaller states's citizens that the United States stands for. This makes it apparent that without the Electoral College only the ""big states"" would matter and the candidates wouldn't have to worry about the small states. "
6631	Finally, the Electoral College does its best to eliminate the issue of not being able to determine the winner when the majority vote does not differ. 
6632	"Most states have a winner-take-all system that  awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate."" This stops the problem that occured in 1968 with Nixon and 1992 with Clinton, and provides a clear definite way to choose the winner. If the Electoral College wasn't in use, lengthy recounts and much controversy would follow elections to try to determine if the votes were fair; this would cause too much strife and unrest within the country "
6633	It can be argued that even with the conflict it provides the people a chance to make their votes count 
6634	but it does more harm than good and it doesn't truly change anything. As a result, the Electoral College solves the issue of uncertainty and significance of vote. 
6635	"In essence, the Electoral College is necessary for the balance and order in the United States to remain. It provides a fair representation and campaign for all regions, allows votes from states with fewer population numbers to have significance, and avoids the issue of trying to determine the president when neither receives the majority vote. This all shows that fewer problems arise when using this procedure, rather than if they use majority vote. ""You help choose your state's electors when you vote for President because when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors."" This shows that the citizens still have power in choosing their candidate and it creates a balance with other parties. In conclusion, the Electoral College should be kept to preserve the integrity and equality the United States is all about.    "
6636	"""Honey, could you go to the CVS and get me some nyquil.  I'm dying here,"" mom says.  ""Yeah, I'll be back in a bit.""  I grab my keys from my pocket and head outside. I unlock my new driveless car and climb in. ""Take me to the CVS,"" I tell the car. It roars to life and backs out of the parking lot. It's been not even two miles and this thing is starting to glitch. ""You will be taking possesion of this car in five minutes, ma'am,"" the car commands. I panic and take hold of the violently shaking steering wheel. Traffics harsh tonight meaning there's some kind of party out in town. The driveless car just unexpectedly starts going in the wrong direction, making me go in shock.  Before I do a full turn I see a lady talking to her baby inside the car. I try to brake, but it just won't budge. I pray that I won't do any harm to them. Unfortunetly it does. I run smack into the front rear, making me black out. They say that before you die, your life flashes back through your eyes. But mine didn't.  I instintly think of mom, dying there in her room, waiting for me to come back. But I won't and this is all because of this driveless car. "
6637	it can harm people, 
6638	it's new technology is very unfamiliar, 
6639	it is not as driveless as you think. 
6640	It will say that it drives itself. It will eventually come to some point where the car can't handle the heavy traffic and pass it on to you. Yep that's right, you get to control a car that does not want to be handled.  A driveless car is a facade for hidding the real truth. Because that's what it's doing.  Hiding the truth. 
6641	These driveless cars I've been telling you about won't make this world any better.  Imagine Earth being invaded by robots. That's right, the new apacolypse. You see these can be extremely dangerous to the environment and the people inside the car. This new technology can't be acurate. There can be some huge change in it that you won't see it coming from two inches away.  And this driveless car being controlled but not by its driver is a false fact. You will eventually drive it too. But this new experiment may be the cause of not returning to your home and giving your mom that nyquil that she wanted so badly because she was dying. 
6642	Americans around the world gather around their televisions, frantically waiting to see who the next leader of the USA is. The first Tuesday of November is always an exciting time for American citizens. Citizens watch the number of votes go up, thinking their vote counted, when in reality, it did not. Many people are aware of the electoral college. The electoral college are the ones truly voting for the United States leader. 
6643	While we may have had this process for years, it's time for us to take a vote to change the way we vote. Citizens of the United States of America should be able to vote by popular vote 
6644	"The world we live in now compared to the 1800s is very different. We've upgraded, not only in our inventions, but our states as well. The electoral college was made when America was first established because it was fit for the needs of that time. The Office of Federal Register states, ""The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between the election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens."" Back then, it was needed to balance things out among the 13 colonies. In those times, we didn't have the advance techonology we have now to see our candidates on screens or in person. Since then, we've turned 13 colonies into 50 states, turned horses into cars, and small radios into televisions. Rules and laws change to fit the current needs all the time. The electoral college should do the same. Due to the fact this system has been around since the founding fathers, major mistakes occur "
6645	This process is too old to keep up with the third largest population in the world 
6646	"Bradford Plumer of source 2 tells us that in 2000 ""Al Gore--thanks to the quirks of the electoral college--won the popular vote but lost the presidency.""  If this is truly a land of democracy and of the people, how could we let such a mistake happen? How could we let majority of citizens vote but not get the person they choose "
6647	"The electoral college imposes on the American freedom and right to choose their president. The United States of America is a representative democracy. The citizens choose who they want to lead but those votes aren't truly their own votes. According to Richard A. Posner of source 3, ""...the Electoral College method is not democratic in a modern sense...it is the electors who elect the president, not the people. When you vote for a presidental candidate, you're actually voting for a slate of electors."" American citizen votes do not matter as much as we think they should. The founding fathers built this country for the people. The people should have an actual voice in who they want to lead this great nation. In addition, Americans should have a direct say. Votes should go straight to the president and not the party's electors. This is not only fair to citizens but also a more relible plan. Bradford Plumer of source 2 explains to us that """"faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please..."" We can't depend on these electors to determine one of the most important things of this country. We can't depend on these ""faithless"" electors to vote who we want when they might do the opposite. Voting by popular vote prevents these mishaps and restores our democracy. "
6648	While others may claim that the electoral college is beneficial to candidates because of big states, small states, and swing states 
6649	"It may be beneficial to candidates but what about the voters? Source 2 reads ""during the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad."" If these candidates expect to lead the third largest country (population wise), they should have to put out the extra effort to visit and campaign to every state. The candidates need to show they care for this country and they are here for everyone. If they cannot put in the extra effort to see the lives they are going to change, do they deserve to be president "
6650	All in all, the electoral college is no longer needed to today. The electoral college is made for the modern world and also disrupts our representative democracy. Times are always changing, we, as a society, are always changing, and the electoral college needs to change as well. 
6651	driverless cars are not something that should be stood for. They will only create trouble that is not needed in the world, and can possibly lead to way bigger issues, such as in our economy. The development and actual distribution of these cars would be something unprecedented and who knows what could come of unprecedented things. In reading this article, it was easy to pick out things that could go wrong, and reasons it would not be in the world's best interest to go further in the development, but it was a lot harder to pick out what could go right and how these cars could help the world. If something might do more harm than good, why do it? 
6652	The Electoral College is a cruel, pointless process that simply makes a percentage of votes, or all of them if you look at it that way, to mean nothing, and allows for circumstances like the 2000 election. 
6653	"There are plenty of reasons, and plenty of contradictions in ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to kep our despised mehod of choosing the President.""  "
6654	To begin, the winner-take-all system is very unfair to the voters. 
6655	Voters in certain, dominated areas are supposed to know what they are voting for, yet get nothing to teach them? Not that it matters regardless, since every person within a state supports a political party, right, and, depending on your state's veiw, all Republicans/Democrats have no idea what they are voting for, correct? Like Bradford Plumer says, you shouldn't have to move to Ohio to be able to get a vote. 
6656	There is also the point countered Mr. Posner's article, which is that those in party-dominated states will have a feeling their vote doesn't count, and he sais that one vote will not swing an election. 
6657	Then why do you beleive an upside of the elecoral college is that those in more neutral states will feel their vote counts? Or do those in party-dominated states not matter, since those in neutrals think way more about their votes, and are the only ones you should trust, according to him? In practice, they are the only deciding factor 
6658	There are also the many unwanted results from electoral colleges, such as the 2000 election's outcome defying the people. 
6659	"What Is the Electoral College?"" states you are voting for electors when you vote, but what is the point if they can simply defy you? It would be like if after the president was chosen, the Senate could overule him with a 1/5 vote. There is also the point in Plumer's article about the time Hawaii sent two slates, which forced the desicion to Nixon, who had to validate only the opponet's votes in fear of otherwise receiving bad publicity. There is also the strange way of resolving a tie, which boils down to the same thing as the winner-take-all system, except if more people support  it doesn't matter. It would be like if everybody in the  room wasn't alowed to vote, other than one voted, but everybody in the room agreed anyway for some strange, miraculous reason. (Of course, the one guy in the  next room doesn't agree, and completely takes out your vote, regardless of the fact that there were 30 people in this one.) "
6660	Now, there is the gregarious amount of contradictory statements that can be found within Mr. Posner's article. 
6661	One has already been mentioned in the winner-take-all system paragraph. 
6662	He also conveintly provides a dispute that had nothing to do with a close vote in the Electoral College, 
6663	everything to do with what is wrong with this winner-take-all system, being the 2000 election. 
6664	In the same paragraph, me mentions how an Electoral tie is highly unlikely- 
6665	as if a tie between the millions of US citizens is. 
6666	can be easily solved by simply giving the presidency to the candidate who receives a plurality of votes, rather than a majority. 
6667	Reasons number 3 and 4 both contradict reason 2 as well, stating that everybody gets a vote, only swing states should get a vote, and only bigger states should get a vote (even when there is a 51/49 split, where 51%=100%, mind you). 
6668	Thus, the Electoral College is completely unfair to voters, and should be abolished. Voters should not have to vote for other votes which could very well defy their's, why not just have the Electoral Cllege do all the voting then? It is both redundant and unfair.    
6669	Though, the process itself has loose ends, overall it benefits the state and national election. The system uses general influence and a representative style of voting that makes the ballot more stable and dependable. 
6670	As a start, Electoral College electors are decided upon by the people 
6671	This means an elector with similar beliefs to the citizens will be chosen and most likely decide their vote in consideration of popular demand. Each state is given representatives in proportion to the poulation of the state. These people can be anyone who does not work in office and maybe a regular American who is probably going to emathize with the needs of the public and if chosen correctly will stand by the option of the state. Electoral College gives a more concentrated form of voting. 
6672	In addition, some may argue that the Electoral College is risky and a representative may not always stay true to their word, but isn't this the case with all types of voting? 
6673	A presidential candidate makes many a promise during their race for Chief Executive and there is no way to be completely certain that these oaths will hold true. The same goes for the Electoral College. Citizens must have faith in the candidate as they would in the presidential election that they will put their country or state before personal wants and carry out their responsibilities honestly. The Electoral College process requires trust like any other form of election. 
6674	In conclusion, the Electoral College should be kept as a part of the voting system because it gives a more concentrated form of voting, it only needs the same amount of trust betweencitizen and candidate as every other election style, and overall makes the voting system more reliable. 
6675	There has been a lot of dispute about the electoral college, therefore causing much confusion. 
6676	The president should be elected by popular vote only. 
6677	This allows all voters to be treated equal, 
6678	avoid untrsutworthhy electors 
6679	veryone will be given the same amount of knowledge about the campaigns. 
6680	The electoral college creates an unfair set up for the voters. 
6681	The winner-takes all system gives all the electors to the presidential candidate who won. This system disregards that the opposing candidate received any votes, because all the electors are given to the winner. This doesn't give a chance to the candidates whose party is not necessarily popular in that state. Candidates, therefore spend more time and money campaigning in states they know their party is popular in. According to Bradfor Plumer in 2000, 25 of the largest media markets did not see a campaign ad, because they lived in one of the seventeen states that had no campaigning. Some candiates don't even campaign in some states based on this. 
6682	"According to an excerpt from  Mother Jones by Bradford Plumer most candidates focus on the ""swing"" states where it is close competiton.  In the case of tie in the electoral vote, the house of reprensentatives vote. This means one  vote represents the whole state. How is that fair for a state like Wyoming that has 500,000 voters? "
6683	Another popular dilema of the electoral college is untrustworthy electors. 
6684	The electors are chosen in different ways. According to Bradford Palmer in 1960 there was a problemwith the Louisiana legistlature choosing bias electors. Segregationists wanted to be rid the democratic electors and replace them with electors who would not vote for John F. Kennedy. In another case, there has been a history of electors voting for whom they want instead of their party's vote. 
6685	Voters often are not update onall the campaigns due to the unfairness of the electoral vote. There's no doubt that the electoral college is a confusing subject, but this often creates confusion in the ballot box too. 
6686	There has been times when voters have casted votes for the wrong candidate. The voters know about the presidential candidate not the elector. States often do not get the same level of campaigning as eachother. According to  Slate Magazine a larger state gets more attention from the presidential candidates than a smaller state does. Over 60 percent of citizens who vote would like a direct election instead of the kind we have now, says Bradford Palmer.  
6687	In my opinion I believe that students should not do community service for a plethora of ways. 
6688	One way i believe that students should not do community service is because they do stuff to help the community in there everyday activities. 
6689	Students recycle paper and throw away trash. There are many people already doing community service. 
6690	For a child it is like punishment to do community service because its taking time out of there own lives to pick up trash. 
6691	Maybe once a every two months the students could go to a community center and help the homeless, such as feed them and talk to them. 
6692	But it should be in school time since a person only has one life to live, and they better make the best of it. 
6693	How many movies have you seen that depict the future with advanced technology such as holograms or even driveless cars? How much of a reality could that be? The case of driveless cars has been something that has been going on for awhile. Even around 2009 Google came out with their first almost driveless car. 
6694	to our economy, 
6695	our safety 
6696	our time. 
6697	To begin, the manufacturing of driveless cars is insanely expensive. 
6698	"Secondly, the driveless cars are supposed to help for the better of the people, they say it would be ""safer"" "
6699	But where is the proof that it is safer? 
6700	Many states have already banned the use of any self-autonomous cars, just leaving out four states who have left them limited use to test out the cars. How can the world just expect for these cars to be safe when we already have superstition over these cars and those who don't will barely let them use the cars too? They also suggest since the driver will probably be bored that they should put in some entertainment in the car. But what happens when, the car stops and has the driver do what they're supposed to, but they aren't prepared because they were entertained by something else? It's unsafe to assume that having all these distracting things around people who are supposed to be driving won't effect how they do in a sudden situation. There is also the hastle of having to reconstruct the roads, which goes back to the point of money and also safety. It is never safe when there is construction going around, especially when they have to reconstruct the whole road in order to make the driveless cars work. 
6701	All in all, the manufacturing of driveless cars is pointless when the car isn't even really driveless. It seems more of a hazard to the economy, the safety of many, and the time of others than it does as an ensuring safe way to get around. In the case of the driveless car, the driveless car lost. There are too many negative effects for it to ever succeed.   
6702	Visualize this: a student has been suffering for months on end from depression. Every day, he is hesitant to attend school, as he knows the stressful environment exacerbates the symptoms of his depression. When he speaks to his principal about taking time off from school, his principal presents an even better solution: taking classes from home. As soon as the student begins his classes online, he notices a shift in his mental health. He actually enjoys learning. This is only one example of the benefits classes online could present 
6703	and providing a way for students to learn while giving them time to attain their goals. 
6704	This method of learning may be more helpful now than ever. At a time where such a great epidemic -the Coronavirus- is present, students risk spreading the disease when they are compelled to go to school despite being ill. 
6705	However, there is no way for them to remain home and keep up with schoolwork. This fear of being unable to attend school and still keeping up with their course load is one that plagues many students. Personally speaking, I can reference numerous students who have felt dangerously ill on school days, but were so afraid of missing tests and presentations that they still came. They felt that if they even missed one day, they would have missed salient lessons, causing their work to pile up, resulting in stress. Providing an alternate method for these students to learn, such as online classes, would have mitigated their concerns. This logic pertains to mental health as well. It is common knowledge that the mental health of adolescents in this generation is declining, and the most prominent reason is school. Online classes provide an avenue for students who feel their mental health is worsening to still receive an education but from a place of comfort, which is their home. 
6706	 Additionally, simply put, some students may just learn better in an online environment. Attending a school with thousands of students is not necessarily the most desirable environment for every student, not every day. 
6707	Students are forced to learn in classrooms with another 20-30 students. Some students have trouble concentrating with so many of their peers present. There will be less people at a time in online classes, so they can learn better and acquire a better grasp on concepts, as there are less distracting factors. The primary benefit, however, is for students with social anxiety, those who feel intimidated by the presence of others, which is more common than one might think. Those who say social anxiety can be reduced by being around large quantities of people at a time do not understand the mechanisms of anxiety. Sometimes time is the best remedy; being forced to indulge in conversation with their peers will only be an obstacle to students with anxiety-related issues. This obstruction is eliminated in distance learning. 
6708	Furthermore, though the specific details of online school have not been listed, such as the duration of classes, it can be assumed that class length will be dependent upon the student. 
6709	For example, if a student's schedule is comprised of Algebra II, Biology, US History, and English Language and Composition, if the student is strong in math, he or she will likely speed through the course, allotting more time to the other subjects. If the online classes are based upon pace, students can get through subjects quicker, rather than being forced to remain in a class for an hour and a half. This results in students having more time to engage in the activities they are passionate about while having more flexible schedules. Why is this significant? Well, for example, places like INOVA have volunteer programs for kids to help senior citizens that require people to work from 12 pm-3 pm on weekdays. A regular student could not possibly participate in that program, regardless of how passionate he or she is about helping the elderly. Alternatively, if a student had an idea for a groundbreaking research project that he or she must complete in a lab, the student could devote more time to developing their procedure and collecting data than before. Attending school in person, regularly, will likely be an obstacle for these students, as a nearly 8 hour long school day with four hours of homework and mandatory extracurriculars does not leave sufficient time for the students to pursue their dreams 
6710	but that is information we will likely never know, as they are not permitted the time necessary to explore their interests. Perhaps there are many students with innovative ideas for research projects that lack the time for it. With the addition of online school, students might be able to devote more time to discovering their interests and pursuing them.  
6711	Although there may be debate about the ways in which online school can be taken advantage of, people should learn to focus on the best in children and the online system, not their potential and minuscule disadvantages. Permitting students to attend classes from home has a variety of advantages. Among those, the most evident ones are that students can focus more of their time on their passions, learn better, and preserve their health without concern of missing class. Schools are meant to be a place where students can grow by obtaining knowledge and applying it. Whether classes are online or in-person should not matter greatly (though online may actually be more helpful), as the outcome of an education will remain the same. Thus, experiencing learning via video conferencing and online resources is a solution to both improve the quality of education and the well being of students in the long-term.  
6712	Why is the world like this? I know it is simply not because community service is bad. I know for sure that is wrong, or is it because people today are too lazy? Or simply scared of criticism? Yet, we as people must give back to our community, not act as if it were to be a burden. 
6713	What if everyday we woke up with a good feeling, a feeling of empathy for others, our lives, and especially our own community within this fine country? We as the children or America must stand up, ignore criticism and judgement and just do the right thing. 
6714	However, if the Electoral College continues to be the nation's way of electing a leader, I'm not so sure I will even have the desire to vote when the time comes. 
6715	When a voter votes for the president, the Electoral College makes it so they are actually voting for an elector, or someone who is supposed to vote for the candidate chosen. 
6716	In civics class, students are taught the difference between popular vote and electoral vote. However, seventh grader do not learn the entirety of it, seeing as learning about the Electoral College may affect how they see the country they live in. Popular vote, to my understanding, is the number of votes a candidate recieves from the American people . Electoral vote, the thing that determines who becomes president, is done by the Electors determined when voters chose which candidate they wanted to win. Electoral vote, and popular vote are not the same thing, for instance one could win the popular vote, yet lose the electoral vote. Why is this? 
6717	Well, one can not promise that an elector, will vote for the same candidate that the American people have already chosen. 
6718	"because of this system, candidates tend to visit only the ""swing"" states, instead of trying to win over the majority of the country, they focus only on the states which change periodically from red to blue! "
6719	Let me explain why this is unfair, each state only casts one vote, so a delegate from Wyoming reprents the vote of 500,000 while a delegate from  California is supposed to represent 35 million! there is no possible way for one person to be able to speak for 500,000+, everyone has their own opinion. Everyone belongs to a political party; not everyone belongs to the same party. 
6720	One may argue that the Electoral College is a good thing and must stay for the benefit of the American people. With large states such as Texas and California, swing states, run-off elections, and certainty of outcome, they have a valid point 
6721	Of course everyone has a valid opinion, but they would be wrong. The Electoral College is the easy way to decide who will lead the country, not the best way. Today's technology can ensure a more fair way to decide the fate of the nation 
6722	I prepose that popular vote be the only way to vote for president. With technological advances, machines can sort throught all the votes and determine who won. This way, the American people can rest assured knowing their vote wasn't thrown away because an Elector voted for the opposing candidate. 
6723	I think we should change the voting method we have now to popular vote because everyone would have a say in getting the right person to become our most important man. 
6724	While this is a tempting and seemingly perfect solution to reducing the number of car accidents, I do not support the idea of driverless cars. 
6725	"The author states in section four that, ""The combination of all of this input is necessary for the driverless car to mimic the skill of a human at the wheel"". While humans are not in any way perfect drivers, the natural instincts and reactions of a human behind the wheel are impossible to capture in the form of sensors, robots, or mechanincs of any kind. In situations where unorthodox solutions are needed to remain in control of the car and keep from crashing, veteran drivers have the knowledge and experience to do so. Robots may have programs to react in certain situations, or to move out of the way if an object is coming towards the car at a rapid speed, but not all situations can be programmed. "
6726	Robots simply cannot react the same ways humans do, 
6727	"Section eight of the passage focuses on the psychological aspects of driverless cars, and introduces thd idea of laziness and boredom in human nature. Later on, the author states that some manufacturers hope to address this problem by including entertainment in the cars to remedy this boredom. Bringing in car entertainment wuld only further distract the now obsolete human drivers from the road, which in the case of an emergency, could prove fatal to not only the driver, but the passengers in the car as well. The Google car mentioned in section 7 ""Announces when the driver should be prepared to take over"". If the human did not hear the car announce this, and the car was reverted to the drivers control, the driver might end up in a crash. "
6728	If the driverless cars provide more distractions than are at hand in the world today, no matter if a human is driving or not, the human driving the car could end up dead along with the passengers of the car. 
6729	If driverless cars do become a reality, human drivers may one day become obsolete.  
6730	Today's world is focused heavily on transportation and getting from one point to the next. Driverless cars would fufil this requirement, but without the help of human drivers. The more that driverless cars would develop and improve, the less and less amount of humans would know how to drive. While this does not seem like a major problem if driverless cars were a reality, but the malfunctioning of systems would prove to be chaotic. If there was a systemwide problem with driverless cars, all of the vehicles in use, malfuctioning or not, would have to be recalled and fixed, causing mass hysteria. Because of the loss of driving skills, nobody would know how to drive. Humans would be unable to travel places, go to work, or do recreational activities. 
6731	Driverless cars may promote many benefits to humans seeking leisure and comfort while driving, but driverless cars could prove to create some very serious safety issues, especially on the busy roads of today's society. 
6732	The Electoral College is stupid and we should not use it.  I have many reasons to believe that this is an unfair system that is adulterating our country's wonderful ways.  
6733	The first reason for why I despise this system is because we have had people with more than half of the country voting for them not be elected President. 
6734	This is due to winning by just enough in certain states that you get their elector votes.  If you win by 51% in a state with 4 electoral votes, but someone else wins by 99% in a state with 3 electoral votes, you will have more electoral votes, but less popular votes.  In the system that we are set up with, electoral votes is how you will get elected for President.  This happened during the Presidental Election in 2000, when Gore won the popular vote, but Busch won the electoral votes and was elected President.  It also happened several times before, most recently in 1888.  
6735	With the Electoral College it is more likely that a tie will happen.  
6736	In the process of the Electoral College, the voters in the smaller states are given more power than those in the larger states. 
6737	Every state gets a minimum of 3 electoral votes, and then more are added depeding on the size of the state's population.  WIth 3 votes for a population of 500,000, Wyoming has more votes per citizen than the larger states do.  Large states with ten of millions of people may have only a few more votes than Wyoming does, giving it's individual citizens more power in choosing the President.  
6738	"Because of the Electoral College, Presidential Canidates spend a large portion of their time in ""Swing States,"" like Ohio or Florida, and little or no time to states with predictable outcomes. "
6739	Imagine winning every game basketball game.  But then your star point guard starts flunking tests and his average goes down.  He gets kicked off the team and your team then starts to lose every game.  Well this could be the case if you don't allow students who have a C average to play.  But yet on the other hand, you are also teaching the students a lesson. 
6740	Now in my opinion, i think that teaching the students lessons are more important than being the best team out. 
6741	Think about this, in college, they give you scholarships for academics and athletics.  But if you play for a team and your grades aren't so well, are they going to keep you on the team?  Probably not.  This is the same as how you should run our school.  We need to prepare for college and by running our school similar to colleges, it will help us to learn how college is ran. 
6742	That is the same with activities, you have privileges if you do good.  If you have bad grades, then your privileges, such as participating in activities, will be taken away 
6743	These lessons we learn, will hopefully pay off, such as getting reprimanded for doing something bad.  Do you think someone who is extremely bad, for example someone who is always getting in trouble in school for misbehaving, should be allowed to be rewarded?  Well that is not right because he thinks that he can be bad and do anything he wants and still be rewarded in the end.  He is not being taught anything and it isn't fair.  How would you feel if you were a student who did good in school, got good grades, and tried your hardest while some other student did bad and took the easy way out and was rewarded in the same way? 
6744	Now do you know who said that?  Our president, Barrack Obama.  What this quote means is that education is what's going to lead us to excel.  So by not allowing students with a C average or lower to participate in sports and activities, there is a lesson being taught. I play sports but yet Part of that lesson is summed up by Obama's quote.  Now based on all this, what's more important- being number one or being educated?  
6745	School is not exactly something everyone looks forward to nowadays. Teenagers are depressed, anxious, and some incredibly sick. It is so difficult to avoid some of the negative things in life when a student is constantly surrounded by peer pressure and bullying. If given the choice, many students would most likely choose to skip school and stay at home. 
6746	First, online classes by way of video conference are very helpful to those who are sick because they are still able to be taught by a teacher. 
6747	"Many students come into school even if they are sick. This causes an illness to spread around the entire student body just because one student couldn't miss class. On the other hand, if a student stays home because they are sick, they miss a lot of classwork and aren't able to pay attend the important lessons being taught. One time, I had to stay home because of a stomach bug. I got behind in my classes and was never really able to understand the concepts as well as I could have if I was taught by my teacher like everyone else. I got a very bad grade on the test on these concepts because I was not able to catch up. If I was able to call in to my missed classes, I would have benefited greatly because I could ask questions if I had any, hear the teacher's explanation, and see how the teacher would solve the problem instead of having to figure it all out on my own. On a more serious level, there are some kids who are, unfortunately, terminally ill. They are either physically unable to go to school because of their type of illness or aren't allowed to go out very often because of the risks and dangers they could face. They are more prone to your typical cold and flu, and it is deadlier for them. If they were able to sit in on their classes through a video conference, then they could still feel like they are going to high school like a ""normal"" teenager. Overall, even if attending classes online was only available to those who are sick, it would still help so many kids. "
6748	Video conferences and attending classes online are also beneficial to a different demographic, those who are bullied and assaulted. 
6749	To protect those who fear going to school because they are constantly putting themselves in danger, the school could give them this option of learning from home. There are so many stories of kids getting beat up at school and the school not trying to fix things or not being able to fix things, and this is a way that the schools can help be a part of the solution. There are also numerous stories of students getting sexually assaulted and raped. These students go through every day, trying to avoid those horrible people who did this horrible thing to them, wondering why they have to put in so much work just so this doesn't happen to them again. The book  Speak brings a lot of light on this issue. The main character goes through this avoiding process and, in the end, is unable to completely avoid her rapist. She finds it extremely difficult to see him in school, acting as if he hasn't done anything wrong. If she was given the option to do online schooling, I bet she would have done it in a heartbeat. She dreaded going to school every day and this extra option would have been a godsend for her. Sometimes, you have to take things into your own hands, and if that means making the decision to do schooling from home, then you do what you gotta do. 
6750	Some may say that students and teenagers need a chance to socially interact with others, and school helps provide that. 
6751	But, everyone has people they interact with outside of school. 
6752	Whether it be in the neighborhood or at church, there are many other ways to get your social fix in. Take home-schooled kids, for example. They might be home alone all day trying to get their schoolwork done, but home-schooled students have these groups called co-ops. These co-ops are groups of other students that are home-schooled that come to learn altogether. This helps those who are home-schooled get themselves some time with other students. 
6753	There are many benefits to having another option for students who are sick and kids who get assaulted and bullied. Many of today's societal issues, whether it be new illnesses spreading or more and more students getting hurt and going to school in fear, affect a teenager's school life. The less focused we are on the issues going on outside of school, the more we are able to focus on what could impact our future. School is vital to our future in today's world, and the administration needs to realize that there are things taking away our focus from school. Teenagers are the future of this world, and the past generations need to realize that things are different that they were in their time. Would you want your children to go to school living in fear? Well, they already are. 
6754	I think students should have the opportunity to do community service, but they shouldn't have to do it. 
6755	One reason I think community service shouldn't be required is because some students may play sports or be in a club or group and not have any time between school and their extracurricular activity to work in the community. 
6756	if you make community service required many students may spend so much time on their community service they may lose the passion for the sport they enjoy so much. 
6757	the students that already do community service may do it for fun or they enjoy helping others, but they may not enjoy it if they are forced to do it. 
6758	also if you make people perform community service many students grades may go down because they are focusing on their community service time than their grades. 
6759	Also if kids do community service then they will also have a good reputation, 
6760	Other kids don't want to do community service because they think it is a waste of time. 
6761	But instead of making all the students do community service, you should make it were you give kids do community service for extra credit for some of their classes that their struggling with. 
6762	But some kids think that it is just a waste of time and they say that they have more important things to do. 
6763	"In paragraph nine,  the text says, ""... according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore- thanks to the quirks of the electoral college- won the popular vote but lost presidency, over 60 percent of voters  would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" The electoral college is responsible for picking electors, who can go behind the peoples back and chose the president nobody wanted. This system or process is a total disaster. Paragraph thirteen states, ""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the 'swing' states. "
6764	We should get rid of the electoral college all together. This system is not working for a lot of people and this is why many people dont care enough to vote anymore. There are people that vote for our state. Why should the people care? If we switched to popular vote, our country might participate in picking who the next president of the United States will be. When people have a voice, they will use it as much as they possibly can.                             
6765	I believe for a student to have a B average should be able to participate in school sports or in other school activities is a reasonable policy.  
6766	It is privilege to be able to participate in school sports and activities cause you learn more things that are useful in the future and help you gain physical strength on some levels 
6767	You also should keep this as a school policy because you shouldn't be able to participate if you are either failing a class or struggling to pass that class you need you won't be able to have any ability to do so in school sports and all. The student is just taking the class for nothing if he/she is failing just to be in a sport and that they don't care about their grade. He/she needs to keep a B average to be able to participate for that gain of socializing and gaining special abilities.  
6768	So, I think we should urge students to come if they need help or at least want to stay on the team or club. 
6769	This system is simply unneeded in modern times and is unneccesarily complicated. The Electoral College must be abolished. 
6770	the Electoral College should be eradicated because it is simply unreliable 
6771	"The result of a direct election would be more transparent and would make the citizens of this country certain the election was democratic and just. The issue lies in the fact that voters are technically only voting for electors to cast a vote for a candidate, and not for a candidate themselves. These electors pledge to vote in favor of the candidate who rightly wins the popular vote in a state, but some attempt to be defiant. For instance, according to Bradford Plumer's article, ""Back in 1960, segregationists in the Lousiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who would oppose John F. Kennedy"" (11). If the Lousiana legislature was successful in their attempt to be defiant, electoral votes would not go to Kennedy despite him winning the popular vote in that state. Another way in which the Electoral College is unreliable is that it allows for a tied vote. There are 538 electoral votes in the system currently in use, meaning it is possible for two candidates to receive 269 votes each. This may seem unlikely, but it is more likely to occur than some might think. For instance, as according to Plumer's aforementioned article, an electoral tie would have occured in 1968 if only 41,971 more votes were for the losing candidate. Additionally, in the 1976 election, if 5,559 voters in the swing state of Ohio, and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had simply voted in favor of the candidate with the minority of the votes, a tie would have occured. In order to resolve a tie, the House of Representatives casts votes to decide the winner of the election. At this point, the impact of each representative is skewed so representatives of states with lower population can more easily decide the state's vote. This happens because each state only votes once, so the few representatives of a small state such as Nebraska can decide who to vote for rather easily, while in California, 55 representatives with different views must colloborate to cast a single vote. "
6772	the Electoral College must be abolished because it does not properly refelct the views of the nation. 
6773	"Citizens' wishes will not always be equivalent to what the electors vote for. This occurs partly because of the winner-take-all system. In this system, the winner of the popular vote in an individual state wins all of the electoral votes a state has. According to the Office of the Federal Register, all but two states use this system. These two states are Nebraska and Maine. As a result of the winner-take-all system, it is possible that a presidential candidate loses the overall popular vote, but wins more electoral votes and thus wins the election. This occurance happened in the infamous 2000 election, when Al Gore won the popular vote but lost to George W. Bush by a mere five electoral votes. If the public indicated they wanted Al Gore as president, why should Bush have won due to this unfair system? It simply doesn't make sense. The winner-take-all system also results in political campaigns to focus their efforts in only certain regions. Some states very predictably vote either for the Republican candidate or for the Democratic candidate. Take Texas, for instance, which has traditionally always voted red. A Democratic candidate knows he should not focus his campaign in Texas, because he realizes his best efforts won't allow him to win the popular vote there and thus win the electoral votes. Because of the tendencies of certain states, many electoral votes are practically predetermined. The states which do not typically only vote in favor of one side are labelled ""swing states"". With the way the Electoral College works, the few states which are a toss-up carry the most weight. Presidential candidates will usually spend most of their time in these swing states, and very little time in others. For example, in the 2000 election, seventeen states were not visited by either candidate. Supporters of the Electoral College view the disproportional focus of campaigns as a positive. According to Richard A. Posner's article in favor of this corrupt system, ""The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constituion..."" (21) "
6774	While it might seem reasonable for larger states to have a larger impact than smaller states, 
6775	it simply isn't a fair way to go about having an election. Voters should each have the same impact, and they would have exactly that in a direct election 
6776	Presently, voters in Florida, for instance, have more impact on the election than a voter in Wyoming. 
6777	Supporters also claim the focus on swing states is beneficial because residents of swing states should be more politically informed due to their state's importance in the election 
6778	This notion is simply a fabrication in order to make the Electoral College seem as if it causes America to be more informed, because there would be no need for residents of specific states to pay closer attention to candidates than residents of others if a direct election were to take place. The Electoral College does not properly reflect the desire of the nation's population, and thus should be replaced. 
6779	Lately there has been lots of tense debates on whether to keep Electoral College votes or not. 
6780	I believe the people should have a better say in who gets to run the USA. We should aboilish the electoral collage because people need to be able to vote for the president himself not his slate of electors. 
6781	Imagine for a minute that you are at school, on three hours of sleep with an innate ability to care for anything at this present time. You wish that you could just crawl back into your hovel and sleep for a few more hours. Despite your most earnest wishes, however, your required presence at school forbids such activities from transpiring. Luckily for you, there is yet a ray of hope. Some schools have begun to offer distance learning as a way for students to attend from home, usually via online means. 
6782	I believe that students stand to gain from this alternate method of attendance. 
6783	distance learning decreases stress on students, 
6784	reduces bullying 
6785	a healthy alternative for students with social anxiety. 
6786	distance learning provides the student with an enhanced ability to pursue self-education.  
6787	"This, consequentially, leads to a decrease in a student's mental and even physical health. This negative environment is usually achieved though an overabundance of homework and classwork, as well as assorted busy-work and tight deadlines. Through that invention which is distance learning, students will have an option to choose a slower-paced working environment. When working from a computer, classwork and homework lose distinction, and just become ""work,"" as there is no assigned place to start and finish it. This alone would do wonders for the mental health of students. To use an example from my own experiences with distance learning, I have found assignments done online to be more enjoyable and less stressful than those done in a classroom. "
6788	"For the uninitiated, bullying is when one person engages in harmful acts repeatedly and over an extended period of time against another person. Schools have only served to increase instances of bullying through zero-tolerance policies, in which the victim is punished equally as much as the aggressor. This also leads to students being afraid to report bullying, as they would also risk punishment. Distance learning would reduce bullying by putting ""distance"" between a bully and a victim of bullying. While cyberbulling would still be present, as well as an issue, it is considerably less damaging when compared to the verbal and physical confrontations that can be seen on school grounds "
6789	"While most students can be considered to be outgoing in one way or another, there is a large minority of students that range from being just generally introverted to having crippling social anxiety. Their needs are usually overlooked in most schools, where the social climate in many cases is best described as ""riotous."" The prospect of attending classes from home for these students would be incredibly enticing, and would be calming for them. To use another personal example, I often find myself to be more productive at home than I do at school, in part because of the disruptive social climate that classrooms have. "
6790	Self-education is, unsurprisingly, when a student independently seeks out and digests information, whether it is needed for school or not. Self-education can also have a profound effect on students, whether by giving them a higher grade on a test, or leading them to decide on a college major based off of a topic that they find to be interesting. To use myself an example, I have been educating myself on matters of Astronomy, Military History, and Geography for approximately 7 years now. In that time, I have participated in three state-level geography competitions, the second of which ranked me as third in the state in knowledge of Ancient Geography. In Astronomy, my self-education allowed me to get full marks on almost every Astronomy-related assignment in school, and in Military History, perhaps my strongest subject, I have connected myself with various historians and am currently making inroads into publishing work of my own design in a Military Journal. With distance learning, myself and every other like-minded student would have more time to pursue these subjects. 
6791	 In conclusion, it is my belief that students would benefit immensely from distance learning. Working from home would take students out of a stressful school environment, and by extension protect them from bullying. That same home environment would also be better suited for more introverted students, who might feel anxious while being in school. Distance learning would also allow students to better pursue self-education, which would have positive effects for them presently and also later in life. Overall, distance learning stands to enrich the lives of students, while also serving to better their mental and physical health. 
6792	Mr. Senator, the United States should keep the Electoral College process. 
6793	This process makes sure that there will be a winner. 
6794	It also makes sure that a candidate doesn't have a regional appeal. 
6795	The Electoral College process is certain that there will be a winner. 
6796	The candidates have no regional appeal using this process. 
6797	If a candidate has a regional appeal they are not likely to win. No region (South, North, etc.) has enough electoral votes to elect a president. For example Romney was in the South and the South has no incentive to campaign, so he gets no electoral votes. 
6798	Community service is a very important thing to do. It is the act in which you are giving back to the community which houses you and your family. After all, if no one does community service, the whole town would be a mess. 
6799	I feel the elctoral college is overpowered and isnt neccsary 
6800	I think that students shouldn't be required to do community service because there family might not have time or maybe there parents wont let them. 
6801	I believe that if driverless cars became legal more accidents would occur and thousands of perople lose their jobs. 
6802	Driverless cars have almost every part of the car controlled by a computer. 
6803	So, what happens if the car's computer lost power because it has been on to long, or it overheats because the computer is working to hard? In all these situations the car would most likely stop functioning correctly , and quite possibly hurt a pasenger. What if an essential part of the car breaks while on the road? The google car has a special piece of equipment called a LIDAR that keeps a constant 3-D model of the area around. If that piece of machinery fails while on the road the driver is required to take control of the car to keep it from driving into any people, buildings, or other cars. In all of the situations above the driver would need to take control of that unique situation, or else fatalities could occur. These are only a couple examples of what could happen if a driverless car malfunctioned while on the road. 
6804	"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" it says that the current taxi system would be taken over by driverless cars. this would put hundreds of thousands of taxi and Uber drivers out of a job. There are also some jobs that cannot be replaced by driverless cars. A job like the trash collector would require the driver to get into the driveway, and get in the correct position to properly and safely collect the trash. Emergerency response vehicles like ambulances, police cars, and fire trucks would also need drivers to get them through traffic quickly, efficiantly, and safely. "
6805	These examples show that hundreds of thousands of people would lose their jobs if driverless cars were to take over. They also show that some jobs can not be completed without a driver behind the wheel. 
6806	Since, driverless cars are driven by computers that means they are suseptable to hackers or other harmful people. 
6807	For example, I'll pick, helping students in your classrooms. Then, I might start tutoring my cousins or neighbors, something to start of with, like a practice. If I'll see or think that I'm good enough, I might move on, tutoring Elementary kids. Later on, I'll be a famous tutor! If I'll be doing a good job at tutoring, I might starting subbing for teachers, then they'll ask me to be a teacher! Which means, that now I'll have a job! So basically, I made my own personal carrier just for helping the community! 
6808	""" I only love my bed and my momma, I'm sorry,"" is a song lyric from famous R&B artist, Drake. This quote may pertain to one, considering many people love the comfort of their own space and bed. One can shop, watch concerts, get food, and more through electronics. So then rises the question: why not attend classes through these same devices? "
6809	Students would benefit from being able to take classes from home by way of online or video conferencing 
6810	students will not have to worry about discrimination of any kind, 
6811	have more control over their learning 
6812	be able to decide the timing in which they learn.  
6813	The school setting is one of the main grounds for bullying; consequently, this affects one's ability to focus and learn. 
6814	This effect is not a problem at home, because one does not have to fear getting talked about by fellow students in the classroom. In the isolation of one's home, nobody sees them, what they have on, how their hair looks, etc. For example, one could have half of their hair undone, and not have to worry about what the next person has to say about it. This online replacement, in fact, completely eliminates the need to get ready and look the utmost best to try to avoid stares and whispers. 
6815	Another example is that a friend has not only told me, but I have witnessed how much online schooling has benefited her for the better. She is not as self conscious as she used to be, due to the fact that, she has gotten very used to being comfortable in her own skin and not having to listen to other people's opinions. In school, she was a C, and occasionally a D, student because she was always leaving class to go speak with counselors about how people would make jokes about her and throw items at her, because she looked different and was Arabian. Since she switched to online schooling, she is now an A and B student. Furthermore, she is about to graduate and get her diploma with a 3.0 GPA. If she did not switch to online schooling, would she be in this situation now? 
6816	People have different ways of learning and getting information into their head. With classes online, one has more control over their learning. 
6817	Studies show that majority of humans have three different ways of learning: audio, visual, and more proactive. With the web, people can simply listen to the lesson, watch it, or write things down and create models in home for a more interactive experience. In addition, taking notes is easier with this strand of learning. One is able to focus, without distractions in a classroom setting. For example, other students being obsessively loud, to the point where, one cannot hear the teacher or be able to do the assignment properly. 
6818	"In the article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming,"" the author presents both positive and negative aspects of cars that drive themselves. Although, there are bountieous reasons why driverless cars are a good thing, there are also myriads of reasons as of why this could also be a bad thing. "
6819	From upgrading roads 
6820	the invasion of privacy, 
6821	"What that piece is stating is in order to have smart cars or driverless cars the U.S will require ""massive upgrades,"" hence the mention of smart roads. "
6822	"The roads will need to have built in radio signals to send messages, in binary code, to the car, to alert the car of road conditions or any problems. In response to knowing this the author states that this was ""simply too expensive to be pratical."" So now that smart roads are out of the question, it is up to technology to teach the car human skills.  "
6823	If it is not being hacked into, technology and the internet is also known to malfunction often, which could lead to innumerable amounts of incidents.  
6824	Another concern with driverless cars is invasion of privacy 
6825	My position of driverless cars is no technology could drive a car better than humans. 
6826	I do agree the world would use less gas, 
6827	but I don't believe it is quite as safe as it seems. 
6828	There are countries and people who are already in debt, we should be trying to help them out before we try to spend billions on smart roads. We also can not just rely on technology to keep us safe, there are already an aboundant amount of technology malfunctions going on, adding this to the equation would not help. Lastly, one that will probably have more of a concern with everyone would be privacy, I do not believe most people would feel safe knowing they are being watched as they are driving, and knowing that fact could even possibly make them unfocused. Driverless cars was a good idea, but I personally do not believe that anyone is ready for them. 
6829	Doing community service shows that kids actually do care about their town and the environment they live in. 
6830	For example if you live by a beach, and there is a lot of garbage, and no one helps pick it up, it can kill the poor harmless animals that might think its food. But if you have all the students help by doing community service it will all get cleaned and we can make sure there are no pieces left behind. 
6831	And it's not only cleaning trash off the ground but also helping at the elderly home or tutoring kids at an elementary school, like reading books, or help planting trees around their school grounds 
6832	Volunteering in community service is a great way to keep students out of trouble. 
6833	Volunteering in community service looks really good on a record, and usually when you apply for a job there is a section that ask for volunteer work, so it could also help some kids get better jobs. 
6834	"When using the ""electoral college"" you are not voting for the president but you are voting for a state of electors. "
6835	"It would be easier to simply allow presidents to get the popular vote in order to make the election more fair all around. The ""electoral college"" is unfair to voters because of the winner-take-all system. "
6836	"It is time to change our voting methods because the ""electoral college"" system is outdated, irrational, and unfair to citizens "
6837	When people place their vote they belive they are putting in a vote for the president they choose, not for a slate of electors. 
6838	When voting for president you are voting for a slate of electors, but do we even know who these supposed electors are! Are votes are being manipulated and we are not even aware of who is doing it. 
6839	In conclusion changing the way people vote is easier for everybody. It saves time for electors and it gives people a chance to see who they are really voting for. Presidents would have to go to each state and appeal to them in order to get a vote. I belive that is what we need. They would be required to actually work for a position in office rather than speaking on whjat they are going to do and paying someone else to elect them. We should have faith in our president and know who we are voting for before we cast our vote. This system seems more fair and more modern to the twenty first century. This is a system most Americans would agree with. 
6840	"In Richard A Posners In Defense of the Electoral Collage he states that the Electoral Collage is good because of the "" swing states"" wich he then says "" The voters in toss-up states are more likely to be the most thoughtful voters because they know they are going to decide the election"" in saying this he means that people who live in swing states will be more careful and more thought out on who they want to vote for. "
6841	"Yet, the word 'rarely' still sticks, and not many can just simply deny that it is not there. The rest of the statment in paragraph 16 continues onto lines 4-6, ""[;however,] it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote."" So in simple terms, you can get the electoral vote which can put you ahead, but you won't win with just that under your belt. The people still matter, and their vote can still count against you. "
6842	You can help pick up trash or recycle and help the community. Or if the students like kids they can go to the daycare to take care of them. Some people want to be a nurse they can volunteer in the hospital. Some people are interested in science they can volunteer in a history or a science museum. A lot of people I see volunteering is a museum are more of senior citizens. Sometimes when they talk you can't hear them correctly. Maybe putting students in the museum will help and themselves can also visit the museum and learn more about history and science. 
6843	A big part of doing community service is that you gain different experiences from different work. 
6844	"im writting this letter to you so you consider changing to election by popular vote for the prsident of the united states instead of electoral college. i belive like branford plumer, that the electoral college is very wrong not only because under the electoral college system, voters dont vote for the president but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. but also because it is very unfair to voters, candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. "
6845	the electoral college is outdated, unfair, and irrational and its time for a change. 
6846	"Manufacturers are constantly trying to improve the quality and advances of their cars, but the question is are they taking a step in the right direction with driverless cars? As mentioned earlier, drivers would still have to be alert while driving these supposedly ""driverless"" cars, they would have to worry about whether it was their fault or the cars fault for an accident, and lawmakers would have to determine if these cars are safe enough to be driven on public roads. WIthout a doubt there will be driverless cars in the twenty-first century, but hopefully by that time, the pros will outweigh the cons. "
6847	In today's society, things are growing and changing at a rapid rate. There are new technological advances and new ideas and innovations that come into this world everyday. One particular subject that comes in mind is the idea of online courses. These courses are mainly for people who do not have easier access or any type of transportation to school which can lead to be very useful. People love this idea and innovation of school and think students could genuinely benefit from this. Undoubtedly, there are a lot of flaws to this, the one major problem that stands out the most is it could cause students to take advantage of these online courses and cheat by using another browser to look up their answer's and could lead to long-term consequences. 
6848	they can gain an in-person experience with teachers 
6849	students can build positive relationships at school. 
6850	Although taking classes from home can be easier to access, students should have more of a in-person experience with teachers to show that they care and help students better understand the questions they have. 
6851	For instance, I have gone to school from a laptop and in person and having the teachers there in person is a very different experience to have than from learning off of a laptop. Because not only does it show that the teachers care, but it makes the students feel like they are really engaged in the activity and makes it more fun to learn. Teachers set the rule for students and sometimes show them the difference between right and wrong. They also sometimes have students engage in fun activities as for another way to learn. Instead of being taught through a screen, people that have teachers in person help students understand what they are trying to learn and can engage in one-on-one conversations in person. 
6852	Even though students can learn from home and not go out anywhere, students need to build positive relationships with others. 
6853	Friends are an ideal part of everyone's lives and online course do not provide that, but schools do. My friend, who i just recently met and has been home schooled his whole life until his senior year, found it hard to have friends because he did not know anybody. He is a shy person and does not like interacting with any out-going activities because he did not know how to engage with other people. Because of this, people who go to public schools at a young age are more likely to make friends there and have even more friends the more they grow up and as they enter high school. All in all, online courses do not provide people like friends that are a key part of our lives and help us build our character and self-esteem about each other. 
6854	A major problem about online courses is that students are more likely to cheat on them and use different web browsers to get the answers they need. 
6855	In conclusion, online course do not benefit students because gaining an in-person experience with teachers can help a student learn better from their mistakes on certain types of questions. They also do not benefit students by having more of a likely chance to cheat during exams online. Because of this, this does not prepare students for further growth of knowledge if they want to continue to do school after high school. The final reason students do not benefit from online courses is that students need friends in person because that is what makes them have a good childhood and become a better person based of off their opinions. To conclude, online courses are not a way to help students at all during this day and age. It has too many flaws that can not be fixed unfortunately. A lot of things are growing in this society, but this should not grow any further. 
6856	Driverless cars are they really a good idea or just an accident waiting to happen? Some people may believe in the driverless car, but others like me see the true danger it brings to the table. These people who are so ready for the future to be here have forgot to look at the possiblities that come along with it. 
6857	The idea of such a car is not a bad idea it just needs to be more thought out and processed.  There are many reasons i believe we should wait to produce such a car, 
6858	one of the most concerning is legal reasons. 
6859	Another concer I have for the car is its safety features. 
6860	"An example of one of my concerns is weather or not the car will be able to tell when school hours are active or when work zones are near by. The text states, ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" This example makes one flaw with the designe of the car, and thats the fact that what if the car doesn't get the update that the danger zone is near and never alerts the driver. Many computers day by day fail to work properly, so who is to say that our self diving cars will not fail as well to do their jobs. "
6861	If our cars dive and control themselves what will keep the man behind the wheel alert or even awake. 
6862	This could cause health risks to anyone who happens to be driving near a unmaned car. I agree with the states that do not allow the testing of the cars in their respected areas. While states such as California, Nevada, and Florida all allow the cars to be tested. These states are putting their people at risk just so they can find all the flaws of the car. Most people will agree when I say that is it really worth the risk of a human life just for a car that can drive itself but not really control itself.  
6863	All of these risks that I have listed are all for what reward. A car that can drive itself does not have the human capablitiy to keep is passengers safe. All of what I have said is to prevent the lose of a life or even just a law suit. I feel that all my concers raise some major red flags that should be covered before the risk of a life or someone's property. 
6864	Freedom to vote for authority figures in America had been an ideal image of government all across the world. However, is our priviledge to vote really honest and are the results of elections really in our hands like we think they are? 
6865	The Electoral College System undoubtedly should be abolished 
6866	although some may believe that Electoral Colleges avoid the occurance of a run-off election, run-off elections may be avoided with much more reasonable methods. 
6867	Clearly, election should be determined by popular vote, and not the Electoral College because Americans earned their right to have full control over the representatives in their government 
6868	"According to Source 2, ""state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and... those electors could always defy the will of the people."" The defenders could be completely indifferent about the voters choices, or situations where swing states are borderline one party or another, and the Electoral College allows a limited selelction of people to make the final decision of millions (Source 1). The ballots that we vote in don't even effect the results of the election. It is as if these elections are trying to illude citizens from the fact that the only votes that contribute to the adoption of a new president are the electoral votes. Why bother letting us vote for a president, if only the defenders get to make the decisions? "
6869	In Source 3, Posner states that when there is an unclear plurality in the results of an election, the Electoral College makes it much simpler and more efficient by reducing the number of voters, eliminating the inconvenience factor. 
6870	You cannot deny, changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States would be extremely beneficial for our country. Citizens would regain their Constitutional-right to vote for the leaders who make major decisions for the entire country. The Electoral College is useful to produce a clear winner in elections, but is evidently not completely necessary and is unfair to voters who want and deserve a say in the outcome(Plumer 13, 14). Abolishing this system would cause for a drastically more fair election and greater citizen satisfaction for multitudinous reasons. Please consider. 
6871	if they are not doing work they are goofing around in the classroom then yes they shouldn't be aloud, but if they are not goofing around and they are doing their work they just need some more help then they should be able to participate is these extra choricial activities. 
6872	In life, we are expected to learn. We learn how the world works, how to do things, and learn from the mistakes we make along the way. Now, it is only fair to say that everyone has a different and unique way of learning, whether it be through hands on activities, trial and error, or just being told what to do. The demand for these needs is high due to the rising population in public schools, and not every student's needs can be met at all times. Some of the students may struggle based on how the curriculum is taught in one class, and excel in another one taught differently. It all depends on how each student receives information the best. Certain educational centers provide distance learning, which provides students with the opportunity to complete their studies and courses online. The courses offer students the chance to have video conferences, independent learning, and many more things that are made for the single purpose of ensuring education. 
6873	As technology advances, this programming should be required for school systems to partake in and offer to their students who would like to take their education by the horns and steer it in the right direction. 
6874	Throughout the school day, everyone has that one class they absolutely hate. They walk into the room and it's like a minute turns from 60 to 1,000 seconds and they are stuck there forever. In this time, nothing gets done and the same amount gets learned. This class consists of about half who actually care about what the subject is, and the other half who can't seem to control themselves enough to not act out in spite of not caring. The half of the students who actually pay attention are stuck with a teacher who has to repeat themselves a thousand times a class period when they should be on another chapter by now. This not only frustrates the teacher and the students, but it creates negative air between the students and the teacher. I mean, who wouldn't hate a teacher that talks about the mitochondria a BILLION times a day? In this situation, some perks of distance learning are shown. The students who show passion to learn can be offered one-on-one time with the instructor through video conferencing, which will not only help the faster paced learners, but take away some of the tension in the classroom. 
6875	Time with a teacher face to face on your own creates comfort and trust built into the instructor-student relationship, promoting better learning. 
6876	"One of the morals that childhood has taught us is that ""slow and steady always wins the race"". This moral is not only unethical, but it shows how unaware we really are. Everyone works at their own pace; some faster and some slower. It's not that the slower paced students are unintelligent or not as bright as the others, it's just their way of producing whatever work they are learning. "
6877	Through distance learning, students don't have to feel pressured to work as fast as other peers and can learn on their own time. 
6878	It also gives students a sense of responsibility and makes them come to terms with reality in a way. This way, they don't have someone constantly spoon-feeding them deadlines and due dates, but they have to remember them on their own. Learning how to budget time is a very important skill that is taught this way, and it is helpful preparation for college. 
6879	Some people have a rougher time in college than others and are scared to commit due to outside sources. Say you are a 20 year old woman in her sophomore year of college, working a tiring job on the night shift, and struggling to pay rent due to classes. You manage to slide by in your courses, trying to get the best out of your work, but you can't help but be late to most classes due to oversleep and exhaustion. Luckily, there are specific colleges that provide classes that can be scheduled around your late nights, and shifts. These colleges are technology-based and provide classes for whenever you need to or are able to come in. 
6880	They respect your employment, and encourage your scheduling as long as you turn in work on time, meet deadlines, and come in to a class period whenever you can. 
6881	These learning environments surround students by other peers and encourage debates, understandings, and protests. The benefits may seem negative, but in these events students start to bounce ideas off of each other and grow in thought processing. Students will attract those who agree with their views and form bonds, creating comfort in the classroom for them. It is easy to feel alone when you don't understand a topic, but it can be valuable to have that other person there in the class who doesn't quite get the same problem you don't. You can collaborate, put together what you both know, and come up with a solution. this not only provides for better learning, but provides children with the social skills they will need for life. 
6882	The goal of distance learning is solely to bring out the best learning capability of students. It is provided so that students of different learning paces can have different method options as to which best fits their area of learning. There is something for everyone, whether it be independent teachings, one-on-one time with teachers, or staying in the classroom. Everyone should have the opportunity to test out distance learning and see whether it is the optimal choice for them or not. We all learn at different paces, but it is important to let ourselves grow on different paths than we thought we would.  
6883	Have you ever thought of a time when you were not sure if you should help the community or not. To me, that has happened multiple of times. 
6884	I think that the students should be required to perform in the community because it would help them in many ways. 
6885	Helping the community learn how to be unselfish, 
6886	be better people in their lives ahead, 
6887	and it would benefit everybody in that community. 
6888	While the students do this task of helping in the community, they will see how helping and thinking about others would do them much good. Not only that but that would also help them to learn to put other peoples needs in front of their wants. They can want a fancy sports car while another person may NEED food to put on the table and feed their children. 
6889	By helping people now and planting trees so on so forth, they will learn that by helping other people would make them feel good inside. That would make them feel that helping others is a fantastic thing that they should carrying on through out their whole life. 
6890	Something as simple as helping a senior citizen cross the street would make a HUGE difference. Planting a tree would give more oxygen to the air and fertilize the soil with its nutrients. doing any little good deed would help the environment and the community around it. 
6891	The idea of enforcing community service on all students is a good idea. 
6892	I believe that it is a good idea because everyone should be taking a part in making the world a better place. 
6893	If you have all student do some sort of community service it will make slowly but surely make this town a better place.  
6894	Many of the student at our school already do community service, but by enforcing this is will push us kids to get involved. Not only will this benefit the student's it will benefit the people in town. 
6895	It is not like your asking to go out and do community service for ever. 
6896	You are just asking student to get out and help out, which might be as simple as picking up garbage on the side of the highway, or volunteering at a nursing home. 
6897	"Electoral College believers think that having electors go on either side to let one canidate win, is right. ""Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign than they would have if the president were picked by popular vote..""(Posner). So these Electoral College followers agree with the electors actually selecting the winner because they don't have to do anything. People can just sit back and watch the electors take the power, while the others do nothing but be slumps. In source one, the Office of the Federal Register mention that ""when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for your candidate's electors."", which means that if voters have friends in the position of an elector, voters might just vote for the elector because theres nothing else to really pay attention to. "
6898	"In source three, Posner states ""it is the electors who elect the president, not the people.""If one has gone through an election, theres a long process and hassle of being able to vote, but if people go through the craziness to vote, why not make the vote count?""""Faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please.""(Plumer, paragraph 11). Not only are voters wasting their time to vote but the electors cheat. For example, if one candidate has the urge to win, they will send one of their electors to be on the opponents side so the opponent loses a vote that they believed would be theres. Electoral College also may not be fair to those in a small state. ""a large state gets more attention from presidential canidates in a campaign than a small state does..."", as said by Posner. Its not fair that even the people who vote from a small state, won't really get recognized because there are bigger states to overrule, and even then, the electors will still choose who they desire. Electoral College is an unfair, and a cheating way to vote. "
6899	To conclude the argument, Electoral College should forsure be removed. Citizens favor popular vote over an electors vote. Candidates and voters enter a whole different threshold to express their political preferance. Why should the government even have voting if there really not truly being seen in the correct way. Citizens want to take a stand and vote in what the mind believes in. Take out Electoral College, and let the voters vote, actually count. 
6900	In my opinion, I strongly believe that cell phones should be turned off and put into people lockers during the school day other than allowing students to have their phones at lunchtime. 
6901	First off, if students are allowed to have their phones on at lunch, it would just encourage kids to take their phones into their class and text their friends while missing important information. 
6902	"We all know that this is already a big problem here. If the new rule is made, the no cell phone rule wont get any 'better'. In fact, the problem will just slowly get worse until texting in class gets out of hand. If cell phones are allowed in school just during lunch, it could be in one kid's mind thinking, ""If its allowed at lunch, then the teacher wont be so strict on texting in class."" Once one kid starts flipping out the cell phone in class, other people will catch on and turn on their mobile devices too. In a matter of months, it could lead to more detentions, more suspensions, and more angry parents. So think, what is the positive of having cell phones even at lunch? "
6903	"Another reason why cell phones shouldn't even be allowed is the lingering question, ""Why do kids need to text in school when their friends are there?"" "
6904	But If you have the same class with your buddy, you don't need to pop out your cell phone just to get the buzz on who's dating who. In other words, cant you talk to your friends at lunch time? 
6905	Also, if cell phones weren't allowed in school and teachers really cracked down on the new rule, it would stop kids right in their tracks from attempting to get their cell phones out while they're learning about the Louisiana Purchase. Overall, this rule would set a great example for kids and teach them that cell phones are a distraction and lead you out of school. This would be a win-win situation. 
6906	In the end, cell phones are really meant for outside of school and immediate emergencies. At best, i recommend that students should have their cell phones off and in their locker during the school day. 
6907	I understand that not everybody has a lot of time on their hands with sports and all different types of activities 
6908	For example, my Mom Mom is a clown. One time I went with her to the nursing home and I can not even tell you how good it felt to see those people smile. With my Mom Mom and I visiting I could just tell how much it meant to them. My Mom Mom would pop one of her corny jokes ... but the patients in the nursing home absolutely LOVED our company. I could tell just by the way they looked at us with a smile from ear to ear that we brightened up their day. I had to miss skating, a sport that i have been doing since I was two years old, to do this community service project, but let me tell you... it is DEFINATELY worthwhile.  
6909	The feeling you get when you see these people's faces are priceless. It's amazing how contagious a smile is. You can not get that feeling of accomplishment... or that feeling that you actually made someone's day that much better any other way other than performing community service. Yes, it sounds like a pain. I do not know any other way to say it other than to BELIEVE ME when i say that knowing that you helped our community in a positive way is one of the greatest things ever. 
6910	The electoral college is something that has been loved, hated, and debated on for some years now. We couold abolish it or keep it the way it is. Some say the electoral college is undemocratic and unfair to the voters and the candidates. But some say it is the best way to vote. 
6911	So why do people want to aboplish the electoral college completely? Because there are some serious things wrong with it. 
6912	"perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote"" (Source 2, Paragraph 4). How can there be a tie in the election of the president? Perhaps because sometimes the electors get to thinking in another midset and vote for the wrong candidate...Yes that is poosible. When people vote for there candidate the electors are the ones being selected and aren't always the way they were in their chosing so therefore there can be a serious tip in votes if the electors don't vote for the candidate of the party they were selected by. ""In 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore-thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a diect election"" (Source 2, Paragrph 1). The people don't want the electoral college anymore, Who's to say they ever did?  "
6913	"each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee, and that trust is rarely betrayed"" (Source 3, Paragraph 2). So when the party selects their electors they are most likely to select the candidate of the party they were selected by. There is also regional appeal,if a president only has diserably mojority of vores in a certain region of the country he is ""unlikely to be a succesful president""( Source 3, Paragraph 5) . This is because if a president is only desired by a certain region and not the rest of the country, the wants of the rest of the country aren't met and he most likely will not tend to the needs of them, and ultimately doesn't have a chance of being selected as president. Finally, when no candidate for president has a clear majority of votes, the electoral college's votes gove a clear winner and a candidate is selected. "
6914	Most people feel good when they help other people, and they do it as often as they can. They might be a volunteer at a soup kitchen, donate money, pick up litter, help someone put up their groceries, or any other community service. Volunteering is a great way to help the community and anyone can do it, however volunteering is called volunteering for a reason. When you volunteer, you're willing to give up your time to help someone else. 
6915	"You shouldn't force someone to volunteer for community service. Volunteering is a choice. That's why it's called ""volunteer."" "
6916	Some people might want to help out, but they don't have time. 
6917	They could have a job after school, plus have to do all of the homework required by your teachers. If you force students to perform a service, they might not be able to reach there highest point academically because they're so bogged down with a to-do list. Students would get too stressed out with everything they have to do. Stress isn't good physically or mentally, and that could cause grades to go down. Not having to do community service would give students more time for studying and other things like an after-school sport or club. If you want more kids to participate in extra-curricular things, you can't add another burden onto their shoulders. You know what they say, All work and no play... 
6918	Helping out the community is very important, but community service isn't the only way for a person to help out in the community. 
6919	Most people recycle, or donate old clothes to a local charity. A recent survey showed that starting a recycling or donating program at our school would have a lot more willing participants than required community service would. In fact, 90% of the student population said they would love to help out with my proposed programs, whereas only 40% would be willing to volunteer for a service. Donating and recycling, or another idea you may have that's easy do to and doesn't take too much time, would be just as helpful to the community as volunteer work would be. 
6920	There is no need for you to require community service in our school. Don't force students to be a volunteer, because then it just wouldn't be volunteering. They wouldn't be as willing to do the service, and they might not do the job as well as they would if they did it by choice, and the community service would be a waste of time if the helper didn't do it right or well enough. 
6921	Throughout time, there have been countless sci-fi films and movies of cars that could drive themselves. However, what may once have seemed like fiction is now becoming a reality. Many companies, like Google, General Motors, and BMW have been working on driverless-car technologies since as early as the late 1950's. Although there are many positive sides to these new technologies, many people fail to realize their potentials and feel as if they are dangerous. This, however, is where they are wrong 
6922	"As stated in the ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" article, Google cofounder Sergey Brin believes that his idea of a driverless car public transport system would use half the feul as today's taxis. As our feul is a fossil feul, meaning one day it will run out, using as little of it as possible is much more than just a good thing. Also, using this idea of a driverless car public transport system would save us a lot of money. Not having to drive your own car and fill it up every week would save you quite a bit on gas money. Also, you would not have to pay for repairs or damages to your vehicle. "
6923	Most of the population of the Earth cannot afford the luxury of their own vehicle. Since they do not have their own means of transportation, it is much harder for them to get a job. Of course, in bigger cities, like Chicago or New York, there are taxis, subways, trains, and busses that provide people the means of transportation that they need. However, in smaller cities and poorer countries, there are not any means of public transportation. In my town, for instance, there are not any busses, trains, taxis, Uber Drivers, or Subways. The only way to get from place to place is by your own car, getting a ride from someone else, by bike, or by foot. If we had a driverless car transpotation system in places like this, many people would be provided with many more oppourtunities to be able to travel from place to place.  
6924	Driverless Car's would prevent many accidents, therefor making driving safer for everyone. 
6925	To begin with some positive aspects to driving these cars include, using half the the fuel of todays cars, driven more than half a million miles without a crash, and protect from danger. 
6926	These driverless claim to use less gas than any other car which would make it more flexible. Without using gas these cars would most likely be using electricity which does lower the pollution levels, this is a positive change. 
6927	But by using electricity it will likely increase payments in electricity which wont be good for people when paying their bills. 
6928	These cars also claim to have driven millions of miles without a crash, 
6929	I admit wreckage free driving is a really good thing 
6930	but even with a non driverless car it could still be free from crashes. You cant blame crashes on the car it is the driver, so the driverless car really isnt that different from a careful driver because either way there are still wreckless drivers that could crash into you. 
6931	As i pointed out in the last example, this car claims to protect from danger but they cant say that for everyone. 
6932	The bad drivers out there could very possibly still hit you even if you are in a driverless car. 
6933	Next,with this car there are many negative aspects that will come with it including the expensiveness, 
6934	not being truly driverless, 
6935	the legal issues. 
6936	This car being driverless and all is a very expensive car to manufactur. 
6937	. Another negative aspect to this car would be the fact that this car isnt even 100% driverless. 
6938	"In paragraph 7 it says ""special touch sensors make sure the driver keeps hold of the wheel"" , I mean i dont see what the point is to buy this car if it needs you took pay attention to the road at all times and keep your hands on the wheel. If you were going to have to do this why not you put your foot on the pedals as wheel and just drive a car yourself and not pay the ridiculous prices that this car will consist of. In paragraph 7 it also says ""human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires"" , if the point of this car is to be driverless then why should a human have to be alert and take over? "
6939	They avoid the problems in the election which no candidate recieves a majoriy of the votes cast. For example, Nixion and Clinton both had 43 percent plurality of popular votes. There is pressure for run-off elections when no candidate wins a majority vote, that pressure greatly complicates the presidential process. 
6940	for example say someone wishes to clean up the trash polluting the community and the land around it in this case the service is needed its good for the community, the school, and the wild-life. Or if their going to help out at a shelter or a church, the service is needed greatly for the homeless, animals, and elderly. And the school which is part of the community should help with donations, food drives, and clothing banks. community service is greatly needed everywhere, since others cant do it by themselves its best to give are neighbors a had every once in a while. That's why we need community service its good for the community and school. 
6941	And if we didn't have community service then the community would be devastated. 
6942	Trash would clutter lots, homeless people and animals would have nowhere to go and the elderly wouldn't get the assistance they need like when some one walks them down the street. or helps them up or down stairs. with out the community's help many people and animals would suffer or go with out. And that could hurt a community very badly. And it pains most students to see these poor people and innocent animals suffer or have to live in such filthy conditions. that's why we ask for community service it makes the community and are self's feel better. So why don't you allow the children who want to help, help. 
6943	and those who don't give it to them as a punishment. 
6944	detention wont teach them their lesson but a couple of hours picking up trash will.  
6945	Though driverless cars may be a thing of the future, my vote is a no. Driverless cars are a bad idea no matter who is behind the wheel. 
6946	Driverless cars may appeal to the younger generation because of the flahy technology 
6947	but the lack of safety tips the scales towards the negative side. 
6948	A driverless car's name portrays the idea that humans do not need to be in control of the car that idea is incorrect. 
6949	"Drivers must stay allert and focused while in a driverless car. This is evident when the text states,""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" (7) This is concerning because people today tend to get distracted while driving a normal car. If the actual driving factor is taken away, drivers could get distracted by almost anything from technology to falling asleep. This would result in serious fatality to not only th person behind the wheel but to people around them. "
6950	In addition, the new entertainment systems in a car may be a new and alien experiance, they point to a rough road ahead. 
6951	"In an attempt to get the driver to pay attention while driving a driverless car, entertainment systems may be inserted in the car. This is pointed out when the text says,""Some manufacturers hope to do that by bringing in-car entertainment and information systems that use heads-up displays."" (8) Though these systems may keep the driver engaged, when it is time to take over the shift from watching or listening to a system to driving a car may take an extended period of time. The driver would also need to gain a sense of where he or she is while driving in order to take control. This would result in an increase in accident on the road. "
6952	No one is perfect and accidents do happen but in a driverless car who is to blame? This issue could cause serious law cases and court battles over injuries or damages indured in a crash with a driverless car. 
6953	"The article suggestd this when the text says,""If the technology fails and someone is inhured, who is at fault-the driver or the manufacturer?"" (9) Not only does the confusion on who is to blame take immense time, it sucks thousands of dollars from the participants in a law suit. Though the court may rule otherwise, the accident could be a result of malfunctioning technology that can not be pinned to an individual. "
6954	On the other hand, driverless cars have multiple downsides, some aspects are clear improvements from automobiles today. 
6955	"The new sensor techology inserted into the driverless cars can improve braking and response to sudden stops. The author includes this in the arguement when they say,""The information from the sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone."" (5) This would decrease the amount of damages done to cars from running into or backing over things because the sensors have eyes where the driver does not. The sensors can provide an advantage to safe driving that would not come from any ordinary car.  "
6956	All in all, driverless cars are unsafe and an illogical invention. The lack of attention that is needed when not driving a car will result in mass accidents and injuries when a driver is needed. Entertainment systems in cars only add to the danger in driverless cars and are unnecessary. Crashes and accidents can not be settled or avenged in court because there is no clear cause to the incident. Though the sensor technology incorporated in the driverless cars gives an advantage for braking and controling the vehicle, the bad outweighs the good in this situation. Driverless cars may be a thing of the future but as of right now, humans are not ready to hit the road without a person behind the wheel. 
6957	With all the problems affiliated with the Electoral College, I believe that the United States should do away with the process. 
6958	This process by which the president is elected is unfair to those of us who are old enough to vote and understand politics 
6959	Another disadvantage is that the system of Electoral College is very confusing to many people. 
6960	Men who are running for a spot as a presidental candidate are not voted for by the citizens of that state. They have to gain supporters who then become the electors. Then the people of that state have to vote for the electors, not the person to become a presidental candidate. Voters can't even directly vote for who they want. What if you vote for a slate of electors, who are supposed to be in favor of the presidnetal candidate you want, but don't vote for him? What happens then? Presidental candidates who should actually get a chance at running for president because they didn't get enough electoral votes. 
6961	"As stated in an article by Bradford Plumer, ""... Al Gore ---thanks to the quirks of the electoral college---won the popular vote but lost the presidency."" The person running for president should be voted for directly by the voters. Someone, such as Al Gore, can get enough of the popular votes, but not enough of the electoral votes becuase they can't swing the votes in some states. This basically means that the majority of the United States would like to have Al Gore as a president, but couldn't because the majority of people in a state didn't want him as president. "
6962	Certainty of outcome: A dispute over the outcome of an electoral college vote is possible-it happend in 2000-but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular group. 
6963	"very four years there is an election.  The election is used to decide who our president will be for the next four years.  The Electoral College is currently being used for our elections.  The articles ""Does the Electoral College Work?"" and ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard Posner believes the Electoral College should continue to stay in use.  On the other hand, the article ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer believes that the Electoral College should be removed from the system of electing the President. "
6964	The Electoral College has been in place for many years and has produced good results.  One good thing the Electoral College does is it prevents a candidate from becoming President if they only have regional appeal.  
6965	"This is crutial because ""a candidate with only regional appeal is unlikely to be a successful president"" (Posner).  With the Electoral College in place it makes it impossible to for a candidate with only regional appeal to become president because no region has enough electoral votes to elect them "
6966	Another helpful thing the Electoral College does is it has a certainty of outcome, so it is less likely for disputes than popular votes.  
6967	"It is less likely for disputes because ""the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote"" (Posner).  Even if a state has a few more votes for the Electoral College it still creates a huge victory.  "
6968	Again, the popular vote will be more fair.  It will be more fair because a president with more popular votes will win.  In the Electoral College, a candidate with the most popular votes does not ensure victory because the other candidate may have more electoral votes.  
6969	his happened in 2000 when Al Gore got more popular votes, but lost the presidency (Plumer).  The Electoral College is not fair to the citizens of this country and to the candidates.  If more people prefer one candidate over the other, then the president should clearly clearly be them. 
6970	" Equally important, popular vote should be used to elect the President because then candidates and voters will pay attention to the campaign.  With the Electoral College candidates only spend time trying to win the votes of the ""swing states.""  "
6971	They will not pay attention to the states that they already know have their vote.  In fact, in the 2000 campaign, there were seventeen states that the candidates never visited.  Two of those are Rhode Island and South Carolina (Plumer).  Every state should be able to see the candidates so the voters get to really know who they are voting for, so they will make a better decision.  
6972	To summarize, popular vote is the only way to ensure that the voters get all the knowledge they need to elect the President, and so that everyone's vote matters. 
6973	The electoral college is unfair to voters across the United States and the amounts of electoral votes doesn't compare to the actual population 
6974	The electoral college have messed up the voting system causing horrific crisis in the United States. 
6975	This system of electoral colleges voting for the president and not actually counting the votes that the people in the United States vote for, which makes it a very outdated system 
6976	the electoral college must go down and replaced by a system called the popular vote to determine the president of this great country. 
6977	Having electoral voters instead of having the popular vote system is unfair to all. Basically the electoral college process consists of only a selection of the senators. The founding father have established this messed  up system in which it compromise between the election of the president by a vote in congress. It is highly unfair because of the winner-take-all system in each state. 
6978	"This means canidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning. For example, they only focus on the ""swing states"" like California. Using the winner-take-all system, smaller states don't get the same oppurtunity as bigger states as in the year of the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see any canidates at all including, Rhode Island and South Carolina which holds the largest media markets. Yet these states didn't get to see a single campaign ad in the designated area. "
6979	Not only that using this system is unfair to all, but this system of electoral votes don't compare to the population 
6980	Meaning the 500,000 voters in a state of Wyoming who wants the other president to win, only have one representative to cast that vote in that whole state of that immense population. While California in the other hand have 55 representatives to cast the votes, in which the represent 35 million voters in that state. Using popular vote, is much more of a precise method or sytem to use. Instead of having one representative from one small state of 500,000 people, the popular votes turned in by qualified citizens will count than just 55 representatives. Imagine having each and everyone's vote count instead of having someone to do it for you. Now that is when people should start voting 
6981	Using the popular vote will indeed avoid many crisis that happened using the electoral system 
6982	"For example, the election that almost turned into complete disaster in the year of 1960 when Vice President Richard Nixon, who was presiding over the senate, validated only his opponent electors, but he made sure to do so ""without establishing a precedent"". This couldv'e been easily fixed if the government at this time would take off the electoral system college and instead use a precise system that many people want, named the popular vote. Popular vote is basically when the people have ""the voice"" and speak for themselves and not to another person "
6983	Another example would be in the year 2000 when U.S. presidential race, Al Gorereceived more individual votes that George W. Bush nation wide, but Bush wonthe election, receiving 271 electoral votes to Gore's 266. With popular vote, Al Gore wouldv'e won the presidency and the citezens of the United States would've gotten what they wanted instead of having people vote for them. This is why population vote should be in effect as soon as possible. 
6984	but having electoral colleges will avoid run-off elections. Run-off elections are when no canidate receives a majority of the votes cast. 
6985	Having popular votes system will be arguably the best system to use for the election and towards the voting process. Using electoral votes will be unfair to voters when they are voting because of the simply winner-take-all basis of each and every one of the fifty states. Not only that it's unfair, it also causes many crisis in the United States dealing with this system alone and then eventually lead to dramatic chaos across the nation. Also, having the amount of electoral votes doesn't compare to the population of the actual state. Remember it is still one representative for the 500,000 people in Wyoming. Popular votes should be used in every political system no matter what situation it is. As the passage says, the argument against direct elections are spuriors at the best. 
6986	One of the best thing about homeschooling is that it can be done at anytime, and anywhere 
6987	Not only does community service help others but, 
6988	it also teaches good skills that students may use later in life. 
6989	Community service also teaches students to look at the greater picture. That the world doesn't always revolve around them. 
6990	Instead of sitting at home all weekend and playing Wii, students should go out and help their community in various ways. 
6991	For example, picking up trash in a local park will help reduce the amount of pollution. Or collecting canned goods would help feed the homeless. 
6992	If our generation starts cleaning up this world and making it a better place, I'm sure that we can teach generations after us to follow in our footsteps. 
6993	"In conclusion I feel that students should have to do community service.  What they ""need"" or want to do probably isn't as important as giving back to the community. The community service does not have to conflict with the students life outside of school; it can be as short as one or two hours. Which is why students have no reason why they shouldn't help.     "
6994	The voters of America do not vote for a president; they vote for a slate of electors who then elect a president. The Electoral College is the process of voters relying on a slate of electors to vote for the pesidential candidate of their choice, though they cannot always guarantee who the electors will vote for. 
6995	it is a non-democratic method since voters do not get to vote for a president diectly, even though the outcome is almost always in the favor of the voter. 
6996	The Electoral College is a non-democratic method of voting because voters only get to vote for a slate of electors, not the president of their choice. 
6997	The Electoral College is an unfair way of voting because citizens do not have a voice in their elcetion; can only hope that their elector votes for the president of their chioce. Our Senator should change to election by popular vote so that every citizen may have a vote!    
6998	The Electoral College should be removed as a way of depicting who the President should be. The idea of the Electoral College is almost great but its just not the way the President should be elected. 
6999	The popular vote is simple, and it makes the presedential campaigns almost mean something. The Electoral College is still a system that is effective, however, the United States government gets its power from the people, so the popular vote would be logical thing to use in depicting who the US President should be. 
7000	"In source two it tells us that Al Gore had won more than 60 percent of the populkar vote, but still lost the presidency because of the flaws in the Electoral system. From the knowledge that I have gained through all three of these articles, it makes no logical sense that Al Gore won the popular vote with 60 percent and still lost the presidency. All of these sources include something along the lines of, ""popular vote elects slate electors to choose president"". "
7001	with that being said, it proves a flaw in the system we use to elect the most powerful man in the world.  
7002	"Now, yes, there is a good thing or two about the Electoral College way of doing things. For instance, as stated in source three, ""Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both ahd a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes."" "
7003	In a situation like this, it doesn't even matter what the popular vote results are becasue the College still gets their unique say in the presidency. However, if we got rid of the Electoral College it wouldn't matter if there was a tie in the popular votes because it could just be disputed in Congress, the same way it would be handled if there were to be a tie in the current Electoral College 
7004	Lets talk about abolishin the electoral college. When you vote, do you think you vote for the president? No. When you vote u dont vote for the president you vote for the slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. The people of America should consider themselfs lucky that the 2000 fiasco election was the biggest election crisis in a century, says the article in setion 2. Honestly if the article syas that Bob Dole was right why even have the electoral college! 
7005	Driverless cars will bring benefits in a way, but also many complications. Accidents are most likely to occur because humans are not driving the vehicle, but the vehicle itself is driving. There would be uprises on who you can actually blame since the driver was driving but the manufacturer created it. There would be no point in getting a license if you are not driving the car. Driverless cars are going to be pointless to even own if you are not driving the car yourself.        
7006	My step sister, Generic_Name, use to do online classes from our home because she suffers from a physical illness that doesn't allow her body to produce enough blood cells. Because my step sisters body does't produce enough blood cells this effects her body to get tired very quickly. Generic_Name can't stand up for long amounts of time and can't preform as much physical activity as others. When Generic_Name preforms too much physical activity, that her body cant obtain, she will get very light-headed and feel as if she's going unconscious. If Generic_Name puts her body at too much physical risk, she could possibly have a seizure. Online classes were very beneficial for my step sister, Generic_Name, because it allowed her to be at rest when learning. 
7007	Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. This is a very beneficial 
7008	to those who suffer any kind of mental or physical illness 
7009	to those who have a busy schedule 
7010	. Although, others believe the youth is too irresponsible to hold themselves accountable for such a tremendous responsibility, and is not beneficial for students. 
7011	The opportunity for students to attend online classes or video conferencing from home can be beneficial to those who suffer any sort of mental or physical illness. 
7012	Both mental and physical illnesses come with a unique everyday battle, for the individuals who suffer from them. Some students suffer from mental illness's like: PTSD, Anxiety, Bipolar, and Depression. When a student suffers from a mental illness and attends a public school it can be extremely difficult to cope. Depression is a mental illness that affects someones thoughts and feelings to occur as more negative. In some cases, depression can affect someone physically. Someone who suffers from depression and attends a public school can face daily difficulties, like, getting out of bed in the morning for school and participating in class. When I was in the eighth grade, I had to transfer out of my public school, Generic_School. I transferred out of Generic_School and instead received my eighth grade education through online classes. I took online classes from home. Attending Generic_School was a difficult responsibility for me at the time because I was in a very depressive state of mind. When taking online classes and being home schooled, I had plenty of extra time to slowly pull myself out of the depressive mindset that I was suffering from. I pulled myself out of this depressive mindset, by using my extra time going to therapy and receiving medication to improve the negative thoughts and feelings that I had towards myself and life. Online classes benefited me because I learned all of the eighth grade circular that I needed to at a pace that was comfortable for me and my mental health at the time.  
7013	Students who take classes online or video conferencing from home can be beneficial to those who have a busier schedule. 
7014	Some children have busier and more complicated lives compared to others. For example, some children are raised in households that their parent guardian struggles financially. When a child is raised into a financially struggling household, he or she will busy themselves by working a full-time job. A child who is raised into a household like this will work full-time because they will do anything it takes for them to be financially stable on their own in their future. A child who works a full-time job, typically doesn't have enough time out of his or hers day to attend a public school. But, he or she will have the opportunity of having extra time to prepare themselves for their future. In a hypothetical situation like this, online classes and video conferencing from home would be very beneficial to students who are born into households were they have no choice but to busy themselves and to be an independent because they can't be dependent on their parent guardian.  
7015	 Although, others believe that distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by online or video conferencing is not beneficial. Others believe that distance learning wouldn't be beneficial for students because the youth is too irresponsible of holding themselves accountable for having such a tremendous responsibility. 
7016	My freshmen year, I had a very close friend, Generic_Name, Generic_Name was a trouble maker at school. Because Generic_Name was a trouble maker at school, her parents thought that public school was not the best place for her to receive an education. Therefore, Generic_Name took online classes at home. Online classes tend to be a very tedious and a independent responsibility that requires a ton of focus and self-control. Generic_Name did not have these qualities. Because Generic_Name took online classes from home and obtained the qualities of having no focus and no self control, she did not take her online classes as seriously as she needed to. During the times that Generic_Name was supposed to be focused with her online circular, she was more focused on boys and going out to parties. Distance learning was not beneficial to Generic_Name because she was too irresponsible to have such a tremendous responsibility that she was supposed to hold her accountable for. 
7017	Although I understand why you would reconsider the policy I believe it could go either way.  Some students may take advantage of the policy and secretly use it in class.  Others might take embarrassing photos of somebody else and ruin their life.  The only way to stop this from happening is to ban cell phones for good, however that can also take away the privileges that some students deserve, so what should happen to the policy?  Here is my answer. 
7018	Continuing,the Electoral college is really regarded as an anachronism aslo known as a non-democratic method of selecting a president. 
7019	"This way of voting for electors lets the people have no say in whose running our goverment! Our goverment should not allow or be based on ""the winner takes all"" method. When we choose for OUR president we should be able to choose OUR electors too! "
7020	How are we supposed to trust these electors if we dont even know who they are and their background until after the election? Who even are these electors i wondered. I figured out that all the electors are actually anyone with a brain and not holding a public office, fantastic. So how do i know they are reliable and going to do whats best for my state and our country? Voters dont even control whom their electors vote for most of the time which is kind of scary. Some electors are even faithless in their party's canidate so they dont even vote for them at all! How can we rely on a group of people who dont rely on their party? 
7021	The Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism, a non-democratic method of selecting a president that needs to be overruled by declaring the canidate who receives the most popular votes the winner. I personally think that is the best way to decide who gets in. 
7022	"Each party selects a slate of electors that are trusted to vote for the party's nominee. Sometimes the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Another reason The Electoral College is a positive way of voting is how certain the outcome is. There is never failure in the counting of the votes and there us rarely a tie between two people. My favorite reason is because ""everybody is president"". This means everybody can make their own decisions and have a great amount of freedom.  "
7023	 The robust political system of the American government is greatly hindered by the Electoral College. The Electoral College isn't completely representative of what citizens really want. History will prove such logic with just a simple recollection of past events. 
7024	"""Back in 1960, segregationists in the Louisiana legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new elector who would oppose John F. Kennedy. (So that a popular vote for Kennedy would not have actually gone to Kennedy.) In the same vein, ""faithless"" electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and case a deciding vote for whomever they please.""  (Paragraph 11) "
7025	Americans are not getting the representation we deserve. In fact, in a democracy, we should be representing our own beliefs, ourselves. The Electoral College must be totally abolished and the popular vote should become the new standard for political voting.  
7026	"Time and time again, we have been shown that the Electoral College is nothing but a gimmick and ""a compromise between election of President by a vote in congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens.""  (Paragraph 1)  by the founding fathers. "
7027	Maybe that had worked in the past, when the population was statistically low compared to today, and citizens were less informed because of the lack of media avaliable, like the internet and television. 
7028	"""At the most basic level, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the tight races in the swing states. "
7029	"During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn't see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single campaign ad.""  (Paragraph 13)  This is ridiculous and not at all fair to voters. In this sense, it is absolutely true that every vote doesn't count. Unless you're in a swing state, your vote may mean very little in the grand scheme of things. Every legal American deserves the right to a balanced and fair election with a true, meaningful vote. "
7030	Claims by supporters of the Electoral College are not effective. In fact, one writer finds Swing States to be a good thing! 
7031	"Yes, ""Voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign--to really listen to the competing candidates--knowing they are going to decide the election. They are likely to be the most thoughtful voters, on average...and the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election.""  "
7032	Seriously, that is absurd. Every voter should have the right to know they are going to decide the election 
7033	This writer is implying that the small state votes are useless, and that the voters in them don't even pay attention to campaigns or research before they vote! As a former resident of a politically smaller-impact state, I know very well that citizens there research thoroughly before they do any voting. Putting thought into a vote isn't just a thing people do in large states. 
7034	"Maybe it will be that way in the future, because due to the Electoral College, votes there don't even matter anymore. Citizens are losing faith in their expressions of freedom and ability to vote and uphold justice. The Electoral College needs to go, because it makes for an unfair political system that only benefits politicians running, not the average joe.""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The best arguments in favor of it are mostly assertions without much basis in reality.""  "
7035	Students should be required to clean the community 
7036	The idea of a driverless car has always been the goal set for future technology. This is seen in the constant stream of futuristic movies or shows. However, those only convey the positive and idealistic aspects of such vehicles. The ignorance of the negative information associated with them causes a personal disbelief in the cars. 
7037	Driverless cars should not be developed due to the overwhelming evidence including that development/testing is against the law in the majority of the world due to the idea of possible malfunctions or irresponsible road behavior from the passengers. 
7038	"The article ""Driverless Cars Are Coming"" speaks about how traffic laws are currently written to include human control of the vehicle in Paragraph 9. Furthermore, it talks about how limited the allowance of testing is. With a large scale rejection of such ideas it is wise to consider the fact that there is not just assumptions made by everyone. The article blatantly puts down the states who did not follow suit in allowing the tests. There was not any consideration of the majority possibly deciding this based on solid fact and the issues not yet addressed by the companies manufacturing the vehicles. So, the legality of the driverless cars is merely one point amongst a plethora of other issues. "
7039	"All throughout the article the accidents in the future were expected. which is why the companies wish for the human assistance to be alert to ""take over"". However, when observing that statement closely the accident would be caused by the car itself due to the fact that it drove in such way. The weather could be an out of control factor involved and if the car does not drive in a way that considers that, then the fault is on the car. The same can be said for a car collision. If all of the vehicles in the world are driven by themselves, then it would be the cars that caused the collision. Paragraph 7 touches on the liability issues of situations similar to those mentioned. The issues surrounding the driverless cars are preventable by not producing them at all. That way there is no room for error when it comes to the safety of those on the road. "
7040	Paragraph 8 discusses making the driving fun by entertaining them. Whereas Paragraph 7 is about the driver taking over and the different functions to make them aware. The key to having the person aware of the dangerous situation is to not have them distracted in the first place. Plus that prevents any accidents if flaws in the warning system should occur. The reason there is a long lasting trust in human judgement on the road is that the people have a chance to take action quick enough. If they were not previously paying attention due to the driverless car then that chance is wasted by them attempting to figure out what the situation is in the first place. Eliminate the possibilty of that irresponsible lack of attention by having the person drive to begin with. 
7041	"Driverless cars would allow too many flaws in the system and legality issues that prevent them for obtaining the title of a safter option. The manufacturers are attempting to make a car that is easier and requires less effort, but in doing so there is a plethora of issues that accompany it. The question of who is legally to blame for issues would waste time and money. During the process of development, the producers are accepting accidents as a given fact instead of trying to produce a flawless car. They are also focusing on the idea of a ""entertaining car"" instead of one that keeps the passengers alert for possible accidents. Therefore, there are too many arguments for safety against the vehicles to even consider mass producing them. The driverless cars are much safer on the big screen than in reality. "
7042	I think having driverless cars is a great idea and a huge milestone.  
7043	Driverless cars have come a long way, and sensors have become more advanced with time. 
7044	Even though most cars aren't completely driverless, many improvements and innovations allow the driverless cars to evolve and become more intriguing. 
7045	"For example, BMW developed the ""Traffic Jam Assistant."" This car could handle driving functions at speeds up to 25 mph. This car also had special touch sensors to ensure the driver holds onto the wheel. Having cars that aren't fully driverless allows the driver to remain alert, so they can take over when there is a situation. This is a great thing about these cars. There are driver seats that vibrate when the car is in danger of backing into something. The Google car announces when the driver should take over. Other cars might have flashing lights or other signals that warn the driver to take control of the vehicle. "
7046	Driverless cars have come a long way and are still in the process of being perfected. New, developed features have different advantages such as the advanced sensors that repsond to dangerous situations and the signals that allow the reader to remain alert. Overall, I think that driverless cars are a major innovation and can be very effectful and beneficial for drivers. 
7047	"in sourse one it states that the ""Electoral college was established in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the president by a vote in congress and  election of the president by a popular vote of qualified citizens "
7048	"""And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team snapped a puicture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos."" "
7049	Also, scientist figured it was just another Martian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh 
7050	I think you should require all students to perform community service because many students laze around with nothing to do, when they could be helping the community. 
7051	Many kids who are bored tend to get caught up in bad things , such as gangs, drugs, and violence. 
7052	In requiring kids to perform community service, you are preventing them from doing bad things, 
7053	you are giving them something to do after school 
7054	and you are helping them help the community. 
7055	I walk around my community to see kids fighting, doing drugs, stealing, and other bad things 
7056	Many kids are bored after school , with nothing to do , no friends to play with, so they sit around and get fat and lazy. 
7057	The popular vote actually listens to the people of the United States' opinion and how they want this country run. The Electoral College has many faults 
7058	If it is not broken why should we fix it? The electoral college system has been with us for as long as we have had presidents and one flaw if going to make us scrap eveything? There are many ways to fix the electoral college and throwing the system in the trash should be the last resort. 
7059	Although the election of 2000 is an example of a problem that shoud be fixed it is not a reason to do away with the system.  
7060	To commence with, the electoral college is a fine system that has easily fixed flaws such as the election of George W. Bush versus Al Gore in which Gore won the popular vote while still losing the whole election. 
7061	"An obvious solution to this problem could be what Nebraska and Maine are doing and introducing proportional representation as opposed to the ""winner-take-all"" system. Also if we were to switch from the electoral college it would take citizens time to get used to the new stystem. "
7062	Henceforth, the electoral college is a reliable system with easily fixed flaws, therefore we should not fix or replace the system. If the electoral college was to be replaced there would be pandemonium as to what system shall replace it, how we will adapt to the new system, and if the system is an improvement or a step back in innovation and our future leaders. 
7063	"""It's offcial: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational"" (Plumer, Source 2). Many do not like the electoral college for these reasons and many others such as it can be a distaster or because it is just plain dumb. Also there are a few reasons why the electoral college should be kept such as avoiding run-off elections or big states, but those not in favor of it out weigh those in favor of it. "
7064	The people who despise the electoral college are in favor of popular vote since it is the better choice. 
7065	For various reasons the electoral college is unfair such as not everyones decisions count just those few people in the electoral collge. 
7066	In a popular vote election everyones vote counts not just those who are considered better than us because they hold authority over people. Those people can also be sneaky and can change votes to be in favor of their choice of president. They will even take bribes sometimes just becuase they can even though us other people do count. 
7067	The system should not even be here today because it is outdated way past our time. 
7068	"""It's hard to say this, but Bob Dole was right: Abolsi the electoral college!"" (Plumer, Source 2) and many others do agree with this statement because it rather true that we do so instead of let a bunch of monkeys run our states and country, but I am pretty sure that sometimes they could even do a better job than those in office right now. "".....over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now"" (Plumer, Source 2) every day as we continue that percentage continues to grow and that data was recorded in 2000. "
7069	"""Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president........Who are the electors? They can be anyone not holding public office. Who picks the electors in the first place? It depends on the state. Sometimes state conventions, sometimes the state party's central committee, soemtimes the presidential candidate themselves. Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always. DO voters sometimes get confused about the electors and vote for the wrong candiate? Sometimes"" (Plumer, Source 2) I know this statement says it all becuase how could one simply not want popular vote after reading this.  "
7070	I believe everyone should be required to do at least 24 hours of community service each year.  That's adds up to only one day of your 365 day year. 
7071	It is not asking for a lot from the us to sacrifice one day. 
7072	I think if you want to do more than 24 hours of service, go right ahead that would be even better.  If 1,000 students each help out for a day, that would be 24,000 hours of community service!  That could make a huge impact in our community.  
7073	I don't know too many people that would much rather do a huge project rather than sacrifice a total of two, maybe three whole days to help out their community.  It wouldn't take long at all.  It could be as easy as picking up some trash in the local park or, if you want to you can be able to tutor kids or help out kids with a disability.  Either way, you are going to help out the community in a positive way. 
7074	Just imagine, what we could be able to do if our whole school were to chip in 24 hours of community service. 
7075	We could do so much if we were to put this rule into our school program.  I do community service every year just to help out the community without being required to do it.  I have cleaned up the park, helped make sandwiches for the homeless, helped kids with disabilities.  I can only imagine how much this could change our community if everybody in our school were required to do this.  People that we would be helping would be so grateful.  We as a school could become the school that everyone talks so greatly about.  We could start promoting this idea around school by hanging posters up, handing out flyers, reminding people on the morning and afternoon announcements.  
7076	If you get behind my idea, I know students and teachers will follow us and make a huge difference in our community.  We could even send out e-mails to each student's parents telling them of this idea.  If the parents find out about this, I believe they will certainly force their kids to take part in a small amount of community service.  All I am asking from you, is to just enforce this one little rule into our school.  It could change lives.  I am not asking for everybody to do a whole lot, just 24 hours of your life to help out the community.  There are so many opportunities for our students to help out our community.  Who knows, maybe you could save somebody's life while doing the community service.  
7077	The United States has ways of being civilaized, and thats by electing leaders. Those leaders that take role of the responsiblitiy are President. Presidents need candidates to vote for them. The only way the President will get elected is by the Electoral College or by popular vote. Although both ways are effective, only one way is the best. 
7078	The U.S should stick with the Electoral College 
7079	"In the article "" In Defenese of the Electoral College"" the author states a good claim. Richard states "" the reason is that the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote"". From this quote Richard points out the even when a candidate has a good amount of  popular vote it all comes down to the Electoral College. The reason is the Electoral College is part of the candidate's team, whether its Democrat or Republican. In the article from Richard he gave an example, "" Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular votes cast for him and Romney"". In this peice of information Richard clearly states on how the Electoral College is stronger then the popular votes. "
7080	"Now in the article ""the indfensible Electoral College"" which was written by Bradford has a different claim. Bradford states "" because of the winner-take-all system in each state, candidates dont spend time in states they know they have no chance of winning"". From this Bradford wants to express that the Electoral College is not fair to voters, and that it has cheesy methods. "
7081	"But even thought Bradfort disagrees with the method, Bradfort still stated the obvious. In the article Plumer states "" taken shortly after Al Gore-thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency"". Although Plumer disagree with the electoral college, Bradford still notices on how the electoral college makes a huge difference. "
7082	"Also it was like the first method to be used. In the first source ""What is the Electoral College"", the author gives some great information. The office states "" the electors are generally chosen by the candidate's political party, but state laws vary on how the electors are selected and what their resposibilities are"". In this statement the Office is stating on how whichever party a person might be in, the electoral college will come through. The reason is because each state has an Electoral college and those states are in differnet parties. If the state that a person might live in is Democrat then the electoral college will go for that party, and same thing for the Republican party. "
7083	"From the other side of Bradford again wants a comeback. In his article Bradford states ""in the same vein, faithless electors have occasionally refuesd to vote for their party's candidate"". "
7084	"Now no one would know if this is true but the electors might have their reasons. But Richard A. Posner comes back and states ""no region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. In this quote its supports the fact that the electors do choose who they please. Plus this makes it fair because candidates wont be getting votes all over the places. Also the electoral college will be trust wirthy because the college follows the majority of the people's vote, and then makes a vaild decision. "
7085	All in all the Electoral College is just the better method of voting. The Electoral College will give what the people want. Also the electoral college  represents the states votes. The reason is because electoral colleges are game changers and a trust worthy method. Certainly it wll be easier to choose a president and break ties.    
7086	Students might prefer staying home and doing assignements instead of waking up for school early,they'll have a chance to sleep in and do school work in the afternoon or at night. Teachers can benefit from online classes because some teachers have young children that need caring and help,teachers will be able to easily take care of them while attending school from home. Teachers will able to teach a whole class while sitting on their couch and even while eating at home or at a restuarent. Being able to attend classes online for students is a great way because traveling far distances or for long period time can be easier,Students won't have excuses on why their assignements weren't done. Students can easily work on their missing assignements because of the option of distance learning from home and being able to video conference teachers. 
7087	Some Students and teachers might not prefer online video conferencing and might not feel comfortable speaking or showing their faces online. Distance learning can be a hard for students that travel to different areas around the world,internet can be a problem because some countries don't have internet connection or they have bad connection. 
7088	Which might cause them not being able to video conference,or work on assignements and big projects that need high quality of internet connection. Many students learn better in person instead of using the computer or video conference. Throughout teaching assignements,teachers might have a hard time explaining or giving details about a specific topic through online classes because they might be used to speaking in front of a class in person. 
7089	The development of these cars would require extensive funding, and this money could be much better spent. 
7090	Some of these cars would only be partially automated and would still require a capable driver at all times, so what would be the point? 
7091	Finally, driverless cars would be concerning from a safety standpoint - would these cars really be able to safely maneuver out of dangerous situations?  
7092	"Automated cars require many sensors and cameras that regular cars do not need, and even with these sensors, the cars are not capaple of completely driving themselves. In order to achieve a reliable driverless system, all of our roads would have to have electricity or magnets installed, which even the article admits would be ""too expensive to be practical"". Furthermore, the money spent on developing these cars could be spent to help those who are less fortunate rather than creating new things for ourselves. "
7093	"These cars would drive most of the time, but they would, ""notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents"". These cars would certainly be helpful, but what would be the point of having a self-driving car if you still have to watch the road as if you were driving yourself? Some manufacturers talk of adding, ""in-car entertainment and information systems,"" but if the driver were focused on these systems, would they be able to react quickly enough if the car approached a dangerous situation?  "
7094	driverless cars should not be developed on a large scale. The huge amount of money that would have to be spent to make these cars safe would be much better spent helping those in need. Furthermore, cars that only partially drive themselves seem to defeat the intended purpose of the driverless car, as well as raising some safety concerns. It would be extremely difficult for the car alone to avoid dangerous situations, and the addition of entertainment systems would limit how much time a driver would have to assess and respond to danger. In all, driverless cars are far too expensive, needless, and dangerous to be developed or produced on a large scale. 
7095	Briiiiiiiiing!  The bell signals and the sound of shuffling papers and zipping bags begins as people pack up for their next class. The teacher bids farewell as their students trickle out the door into the busy hallway. Students chat as they meander to their next classroom. Settling down, they pull out their notebooks for their lesson. The teacher begins, interacting with them and receiving questions. While this seems like a standard snippet of a high school experience, there are many factors that would be lost if school began allowing the use of distance learning 
7096	One thing that many students struggle with is attention. However, being in a classroom environment helps students maintain focus 
7097	First of all, classrooms have a live, and trained teacher. Students are able to learn from someone that they get to know throughout the year. Interaction is easy with both the teacher, and with other students in the room. With a live teacher, the learner can ask and answer questions easily and receive personal attention concerning their individual issues with topics or assignments. This factor helps students maintain focus as they are able to quickly resolve confusion and the teacher can alert them if they begin to zone out or get distracted 
7098	Secondly, a schedule is very important in maintaining a balanced day. Having classes aligned for the week can enable students to practice time management and help them be alert for appropriate times throughout each day. To my friend, having a schedule is extremely important. Without one, she gets concerned that she will not be able to accomplish what needs to get done. To combat this fear, she creates lists, with scheduled times, that allow her align her personal schedule with her tasks. Similarly to my friend, students need to able to see what they need to learn in that day and get it done. They can work on getting to class on time, and due to breaks and meals throughout the day, they can relax knowing that their time is planned out for them. This ability is lost when students make choices as to when they feel like taking their online or video conference classes 
7099	Lastly, the school environment is made for learning. Classrooms have helpful posters and worksheets that guide students in their learning. The walls are usually soundproofed, and teachers help to prevent distractions. This setup is in direct contrast to a home environment. Also, being present in the classroom helps to prevent technology malfunctions and poor connection that could be disruptive or deteriorate the student's ability to learn. 
7100	When using distance learning, students lose the ability to participate in many activities that are both crucial and embellishing to school life. 
7101	For example, for science classes, participating in labs helps develop the understanding of the material and helps learners of all types, such as visual, auditory and kinetic. In other classes such as the humanities, seminars and workshops are important. These activities are inhibited when a student uses an online learning platform 
7102	Also, people think in a variety of ways. When put together, they can combine ideas and think about topics from different angles. Teachers often create group assignments to enable students to think together. This is extremely difficult to do when a student does not attend class in a classroom. Similarly, students are unable to join clubs, and are limited in their extracurricular activities, such as sports. These entertaining experiences help students unwind while doing something they enjoy. In the case of sports, exercise helps create endorphins that make a student happier and healthier. Clubs allow students to branch out in their interests and take action in issues that are important to them. I started a club which allowed me to combine my love for music and community service. This helped improve my school experience. Opportunities like these are limited when classes are taken through technology 
7103	Lastly, many school strive to have entertaining activities for students to do with friends. My school does fairs, bake-offs, karaoke, and volleyball scrimmages. We also have an entire week in which students can wear funny outfits that coincide with a theme. It is a way to spend time with friends and try something new. When a student takes classes at home, they are unable to participate in these diverse and exciting events. 
7104	It is true that students are able to be more comfortable at home by having a choice in what they wear, where they sit, or when they take the classes, but this is often a negative factor. Being too comfortable can be distracting and it does not benefit the learning experience. The brain tells the body that it is at home and it can cause the mind to be less focused. 
7105	While distance learning may sound productive and helpful, in reality, it lessens the ability for students to learn. They lose the ability to get proper instruction, participate in activities, have a scheduled day, and have a necessary learning environment. As technology becomes increasingly popular, students begin to lose important connections with peers and family. To prevent this from happening in schools, students need to be present for class. To create the best learning environment for everyone, a classroom experience trumps the use of online learning. 
7106	To begin with, I strongly believe state senator should change the election by popular vote for the president of the United States because Electoral College is unfair to voters. 
7107	Secondly, I strongly believe state senator should change the election by popular vote for the president of the United States because it can cause problems in your state. 
7108	Imagine you were a kid at school, and you forgot it was a shortened day. You need to call your parents but, no, you can't because your principal decided to ban cell phones all together. Now what? 
7109	In case of emergencies 
7110	even to make sure of an after-school event, phones could be in great use. With Policy 2 in act, you could be staying in school for many hours until your ride picks you up. 
7111	In case of an emergency, a phone would be great to have. 
7112	"What if, during lunch, my friend breaks a bone or gets an asthma attack. There would be no time to call a teacher for help and even if they did come, what would they do for help? Any student's first instinct would be to take out their phone and call 911. Once your done with that, you tell your friend to call a teacher from somewhere so that they can handle the situation. ""Whew,"" you say. ""thankfully I had my cell phone."" "
7113	Another reason why having a functional mobile at school would be nice to have: a ride. 
7114	"I forgot I had basketball practice at the gym after school and what should I do? You can simply call your ride and telling them they need to come later. What if your ride was your mom and you didn't have your phone because you didn't want any phones in your school? Well I can almost imagine what will happen next: my mom comes to pick me up, she doesn't find me, and every mom's first reaction to this mishap will be, ""MY SON/DAUGHTER HAS BEEN KIDNAPPED!"" This ""exciting"" commotion happened because you decided to go with Policy 2.  "
7115	Please consider this letter because if you don't, before you know it, our school's phone bill will increase because students will be needing to use school phones to call people. With this, our budget will decrease, leaving the school left with no money for more important reasons.  
7116	Community service is beneficial to many individuals, groups, and areas. It brings out the best in many people, including those who carry it out. It shows good personality and is superb for getting into college. However, if community service was to be necessary, then it would not be as beneficial. 
7117	If community service was mandatory, it would not be viewed as a nice thing, it would not be enjoyed by all, and would not be as beneficial to the community.  
7118	To begin with, community service would not be viewed as such a nice thing if it were required. 
7119	For example, two schools in an area have their 8th grade students do at least an hour of community service a day. Eventually, people would forget how nice it is because it would become a usual thing around the town. This shows that if everyone in 8th grade performed community service daily, or even weekly, citizens would view it as the students doing what they need to do, rather than how nice those students are. 
7120	Furthermore, community service is done by those who enjoy helping others. 
7121	If all 8th graders had to do it then it would not bring out the best in them and would be dreaded by some.  Supporting this, the whole 8th grade of 120 students have to do an hour of community service a day. 40 out of the 120 do not like the labor and dread it, causing them to have the thought of community service in their heads the whole day. This would cause changes in attitudes throughout daily life . In addition, it would lead to bad attitudes towards helping the community and bad habits for the future. 
7122	Finally, citizens would not view community service as beneficial for the community as they do now. 
7123	For example, all the students of the 8th grade work every day for six months for the community. As the seventh month approaches, civilians cease to realize how helpful community service is because they are so used to it. This concept is the same as taking the ability to walk for granted. It demonstrates that when people are used to something, they begin to take it for granted. This will eventually result in little or no appreciation of community service.  
7124	Helping the community is great for personality, beneficial to the community, and excellent on a resume. If it became required for even just 8th graders, then community service would negatively change completely. In addition to community service itself changing, personality within students and some citizens will change, regarding community service. It is important to not take community service for granted because it helps the community and brings out the best in people.  
7125	the Electoral College has always been a good way to elect our leaders, and it is the best way to do it 
7126	because when a state feels like they have a chance of having their candidate win, they put more thought into the vote they cast knowing that their vote counts. Having voters put more thought into their votes instead of not caring as much gives the better candidate a greater chance of winning, if one candidate was truly better than the other. The more thoughtfull canidates in a swing state will pull more information from the candidates campaigns. Popular vote does not use the winner takes all method so the idea of swing states will no longer have any effect in the election. 
7127	Although some people think students have no benefits from online learning, it should be known that students do in fact benefit from online learning. 
7128	There are several ways students can benefit from online education currently. One benefit being that it gives students the chance to work at their own pace and not feel pressured to keep up with the rest of the class. 
7129	This would've needed to be done, had learning been set in a classroom setting. For example, a student may not understand a concept in math and want to try and fully understand the concept before being tested on it. In schools currently, many students are being forced to take tests having not have comprehended the topic of study. This also leads to the problem of social influence on a students learning. As humans, we tend to conform to the rest of society and value deeply what society has to say about us. Students self-esteem and self-efficacy go down when they don't understand a topic. Students tend to not want to be the outcast when it comes to not understanding a topic, so they just go ahead with a test, which results in them doing poorly on because not enough time was given to them. Online school provides this option, so a student is not given a test before they thoroughly understand the concept 
7130	This leads me into another benefit to online learning. Another benefit to online learning would be that it is a potential stress reliever or minimizes stress. 
7131	Many students may feel better and be less stressed doing homework or school work, because of being in the comfort of their own home or in a space that is safe for them. Students feel free to take breaks and not be restricted to the overcrowded rooms that are common in regular schools. It's also proven that surroundings have an effect on mood and willingness to learn. If the atmosphere of a classroom is sad, depressing, or gloomy, then students may have a gloomy or depressing attitude when in that class, hindering them from learning at their fullest potentials. With online schools, the student chooses their place of study and knows what places motivate them to create high quality work and retain the most information. 
7132	When doing online school, the student doesn't have access to a tangible teacher or access to a teacher 24/7. Sometimes students will have to wait for a teacher, if the teacher works for both online and public schools, to answer a question that the student has on a problem or concept. Sometimes students will have to figure out the concept themselves which develops their problem-solving skills. The independence and problem-solving skills can become useful later on when the student applies for a job. Many employers like employees who don't depend on the employer for everything but can try and solve problems on their own first. For example, when working at a McDonalds drive-thru with a line full of people, the employee doesn't have time to be asking the employer a series of questions if a problem occurs. Instead, the employee must find quick solutions and learn independence. The employee won't learn unless they try it. 
7133	Another benefit to online education is the student learns time management and responsibility. 
7134	Although online education is flexible, school work still needs to be completed in a timely manner and it is the students responsibility to get it done, for there is no one around to set verbal due dates. Students still need to write papers in online school, but the only difference is there is no teacher to remind you of the due date and pressure you to complete it. Later in life, those online students are very aware of due dates and deadlines,for they have been accustomed to following them throughout their high school careers. Employers like employees who are punctual and have tasks or assignments done on time. This idea of time management also prepares the student for college if they choose to go to an actual college or university. Professors like assignments done on time and also won't give too many frequent reminders on when those assignments are due. Professors also like when students take accountability for their actions. It's not the teachers fault if work is not completed on time or is lost. The blame is solely put on the student. 
7135	Online schooling truly depends on the person at hand. What works for one person doesn't always work for another. Online school promotes both current and future benefits, as does public schools. There is no say in which one is better or worse. As individuals we are all different and possess different traits and qualities. With so many individuals in the world, it's important that we accommodate all people. A person may strive in one situation but stress in another. This means that online schooling should remain an option for students and families. 
7136	When someone thinks of the future, he or she may think of crazy gadgets that are made of technology years and years from our own time. However, humans aren't too far off from making these gadgets a reality. In particular, research and many tests concerning driverless cars have been happening for quite some time now. It gets people wondering though; does the development of these driverless cars reap more benefits than negatives? 
7137	In my opinion, the development of driverless cars should be supported because of it will bring efficiency and safety for the entire human race. 
7138	the development of driverless cars can bring efficiency to the day-to-day life of an average human. 
7139	"The vision for these cars is that they will be a part of, ""a public-transport taxi system. The cars [Google cofounder Sergey Brin] foresees would use half the fuel of today's taxis."" The United States is one of the largest sources of oil consumption, and we tend to get all of our gas from other countries. With the direction these cars seem to be taking, we'd not only reduce the amount of gas we use in the United States, but in the entire world. We wouldn't be emitting nearly as much air pollution either. The benefit of public transportation is also significant due to the fact that, it too, decreases all of these factors. Based on my knowledge, most European countries tend to consume a lot less oil than the United States because they use public transportation. It's a lot more efficient than everyone owning an individual car and driving. By supporting the development of driverless cars, all of these imaginable benefits for the efficiency of transportation can become a reality. "
7140	the development of driverless cars can aid in concerns of safety. 
7141	"As the passage says, ""Within 10 years, [] sensors had become more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers ... Further improvements in sensors and computer hardware and software to make driving safer are also leading to cars that can handle more and more driving tasks on their own."" This is extemely significant, seeing as how automobile accidents are one of the leading causes of death in the United States. With these driverless cars, people are able to step in when absolutely necessary; other than that, the car can sense most danger and avoid it. These cars so far allow for ""far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone."" We are already in a great spot as safety is concerned, and with further development comes even better improvements. If what Sergey Brin envisions becomes a reality, driverless cars could be the cause of a lot less death in automobile accidents worldwide.  "
7142	the development of the driverless car has come very far in the very short time that it's been around. It's already allowed for a safer experience with automated brakes, multiple sensors, and notifications to the driver when something is wrong. With even further development than what we have already, safety could eventually not be a concern at all. With that being developed, so too are ways in efficiency and cost of transportation. By being for the development of driverless cars, so many significant benefits could be here in the years to come. 
7143	But then you have to also consider if this technology were to fail or have glitches that could be very dangerous. 
7144	I think having popular votes would be better 
7145	Students will benefit from having the option to attend classes from home. There are several schools that offer the choice to learn from home and students have been able to benefit from it. Allowing students to have a choice in their education offers relief from forcing them to learn a certain way that brings them discomfort. Some may believe that offering distance learning is an awful idea because it keeps students from society, and while that may be true the option offers a unique way of learning. 
7146	Students should be able to attend classes from home 
7147	because it offers a comfortable environment for them to learn in 
7148	it gives them another way to learn 
7149	it prepares them for a possible future. 
7150	While learning students should feel comfortable in the environment they are in and doing it from home allows them freedom from other outside pressures 
7151	Allowing students to attend classes from home removes stress from having to do assignments in a rush; however, there are certain programs that do have time limits for assignments, some give students a leeway to do them. For example, my cousin felt stress and discomfort at his school with the way he was learning, so my family moved him to online learning at home, and now he is in a better environment to succeed in his education. 
7152	while it might be true, we can see how students can be affected by observing them. Furthermore, certain environments give prime examples of how comfort affects the way students receive knowledge.  
7153	In the world some people are not provided with many choices in how they want their life to be, so offering the option to students is a pleasant idea. 
7154	Some children in other parts of the world do not get to have a choice in how they receive an education, so giving the option does matter. Each student perceives knowledge in a different way and because the world is changing with technology and the internet, attending classes at home by the way of online or video conferencing does not sound like such a horrific idea. 
7155	One last benefit of allowing students to learn from home is that they will be prepared for the future if they decide to pursue a job or career that makes you work from home. 
7156	In conclusion, students will benefit in different ways from being offered the option to attend classes at home. Schools are allowing students to have a say in their education which is what matters because choices are considered to be something important. Attending classes at home allows students to have an option in the way they receive knowledge because it could be a fun, unique, and new way of learning for them. While students will be in a pleasant environment, will be given a choice, and will be prepared for something in a near future. Furthermore, changing the way students learn will be a key part in the future when everything changes with time. 
7157	The last reason, why we should change over to election by popular vote is because of the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote. 
7158	The way the Electoral College handles ties is unprofessional to many, becasue all they do is throw the election to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. The single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters. 
7159	"The President of the United States is currently determined by an electoral college. The electoral college process involves the public voting for their elector and not the main focus, the candidates. Through this, many of the states gain more power than they should, and the votes are set up as a ""Winner-takes-all"" system. "
7160	This unneccessary and inaccurate use of votes is outdated and needs to be shut down. 
7161	In an instant, an electoral college voter could change his or her mind and go against his or her original political party. 
7162	"""Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote,"" says source 2. A tie in the votes, which is very much possible since the total number of votes is 538, according to source 1, could then allow the fate of America to rest in the hands of the House of Representatives, a miniscule representation of the people. "
7163	If the voting system were to be changed to the popular vote, the results would accurately display the winner that the majority of America chose.  
7164	"""It's official: The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational,"" says Bradford Plumer, and he couldn't be closer to the truth. The electoral college system does not represent the people of America accurately and is more likely to result in a tie compared to the popular vote. To conclude, source 3 says the electoral college is ""a non-democratic method of selecting a president that ought to be overruled by declaring the candidate who receives the most popular votes the winner "
7165	Some of my friends do community service for our town. Meanwhile, some of my other friends do not do community service, and think that it is a waste of their time. I think that community service is a wonderful thing to do. 
7166	I think that you should consider making community service mandatory for all students. 
7167	Community service, helps others in need, 
7168	teaches students responsibility 
7169	and gets them involved in what is happening around them.  
7170	First of all, community service helps others in need. 
7171	By making community service mandatory, you will be helping the lives of many other people or the environment. Little things like picking up trash in the park, or walking a neighbors dog, would really help out the town and the people living in it. Small things can make a big difference. And if everyone has to do community service, our town will be making a big difference in our community. 
7172	Next, community service will teach students responsibility. 
7173	Lastly, it helps students get involved in what around them. 
7174	Community service will help students to know what is going on in their town. By helping out a less fortunate family will let a student know that there are people in town that need help. And that there are little things that we can do to help them. Also, if a student is tutoring a child, they will learn that there are kids that may need a little more help then he or she might need. And that tutoring them can help make a very big difference.  
7175	In conclusion, I think you should make all students do community service for our town. It will help many others in our town that need help. It will help teach students responsibility. Also, it will get students involved in what is happening around them. Therefore I think that you should make community service mandatory for all students in our school. 
7176	"The Electoral College was established in the Constitution by the founding fathers. ""The Electoral College process consists of the selection of electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for president and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress"" is stated in source 1. This is process has been around for decades, but things have changed. "
7177	This process does not fit with what is happening in the present and is outdated. The election should be by popular vote. 
7178	"There is a disaster factor.  According to ""Source 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"", it's says that the state legislatures are responsible for picking electors. The thing is that those electors can betray the trust which has happened before. You do not want to risk having someone defy the will of the people. "
7179	Some people may argue that the states know what they are doing and are cautious on who to pick 
7180	but in the past the electors have refused to vote for their party's candidate. You do not want to put this in hands of someone who will not help you and the other people on such an important event like voting. 
7181	When you vote, there is a slight possibility of a tie occuring. If this were to happen, the state delegations would vote on which president. Each state will cast one vote, which is not fair because of the amount of representives in different states. 
7182	"Some presidents may have a stronger appeal to some states then others. It may have to do with where the president is from (North, South). This goes back to how the bigger states have more power. ""...such as Romney was in the South, has no incentive to campaign heavily in those states,"" is stated in source 3. This means that the bigger states in the South will be known for all voting Romney since that is where he is the strongest and well liked. There may be voters in the South that were more for Obama. Smaller states may hate what Romney is doing and vote for Obama, but they do not have as much power as the bigger states. "
7183	This is like the winner takes it all, they may know that they have no chance in winning. 
7184	The Electoral College is not a fair process. It worked in the past, but not anymore. Using the popular vote process is more fair for all of the people. They have more say and there votes feel more important. This will encourage potential voters to vote and to become more involved with the political events. 
7185	Some students have a hard time getting to school. Whether it be sickness, not having a ride to school, or even a family emergency, getting to school can be difficult sometimes and often students will suffer consequences if they arent able to show up to school, especially since only a certain number of those absences can be marked as excused. Teachers may also have difficulty getting to school, or its simpy better for them to work from home and aviod the irritation of some students,Something that would be able to solve this issue is if classes were able to be online. Even though most of the class work is already online, some students grades are going down even if they do the work from home, and most of the time its because attendance is a portion of the grade 
7186	and finally if the school has to cancel due to weather or illness related issues, 
7187	One of the many reasons online school would be beneficial is because it makes it easier for students who might have social issues and have a hard time participating in class activities 
7188	I have a friend named Generic_Name who has really bad anxiety and often misses a lot of school because shes afraid of having to present in class, or deal with other students face to face. Specifically in her history class, where her teacher assigns lots of group projects, or work that needs to be presented, its really challenging for her to focus, If her class were to be an online course, it would eliminate the fear of presenting in front of her class, because she could have a private session with the teacher, and possibly present it that way, or with a smaller group of students that shes comfortable with. Now some people could disagree, and say Generic_Name needs to get over her fear,and education is more important, but having the option for an online class would help her relax, and focus more on her school work rather than her personal fears. 
7189	Another reason it would be beneficial is if a student misses a class. 
7190	My friend Generic_Name was sick not that long ago with the flu, and missed all of her classes for a week straight. Even though she did her work, her grade and attendance suffered because she wasnt able to show up to class, and most of the absences were unexcused. If classes were online, she would be able to log on, and get her attendance points, and her points from the curriculum. People could disagree and say that students would get lazy, and not long onto the program to do their work, however those students would still have to face the consequences of a lower grade and possible detention,or a mark off for not signing into the programs. Its really the same as a regular class, it just offers the comfort of home, and personal resources and still gives students the opportunity to get the help they need. 
7191	The last example is if schools had to shut down due to weather or other issues. 
7192	School districts only have a certain amount of school days they can miss before they have to start cutting into summer vacation, which is unfair for both students and teachers. Due to current events, the Corona Virus is making lots of parents and students paranoid, and while my school personally has around 15 days of off time since we didnt get any snow this year, that would either be 15 days of missed schooling entirely, or if we end up surpassing those days, the school year extends to meet the days required to be in school. 
7193	If most classes were able to be taken online, teachers would still be able to teach the required lessons and students would be able to learn, and still have time to ask the teacher for help or advice. 
7194	but those can easily be made up, and if need be, those classes can remain physical if thats what the school board needs, or what the students need to meet the graduation requirements. Again, its not that much different than regular schooling. 
7195	The electoral system shouldn't be used as a system of voting, who honestly wants to vote for someone who will vote for you, and if we are truly a state thats votes for its own president then why doesn't the popular vote count as the offical vote? 
7196	The Electoral College is a system that is rather unfit as a system of the people's voting. When you vote for your president, you're really just voting for who you think should vote for them. 
7197	"The article ""Does the Electoral College Work?"" states, ""...when you vote for your candidate you are actually voting for you candidate's electors."" The Constitution states that we are able to vote for our president, but then what do you call this? This is not an example of what America stands for, and this is certainly not the voting system that is described by our nation's properties. There is another issue with this violation of rights concerning our voting system, it's how the Electoral College votes and how dependable they are. The article ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong."" talks about how you can't control who the electorals you chose vote for. ""Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always."" This statement helps prove that the president you may want may not even get you vote. The Electoral College not only takes away your right to assuringly vote for the president of your choice, but it also takes away right personal voting right as an American. Don't let someone else detain your freedom of speech, let you personal voice be heard by the people. "
7198	While the Electoral College may seem like a sure fire way to assure that we get a president, that doesn't really mean the majority wants that president. Think about it, we don't always get the president we voted for. Popular vote doesn't really matter, it's like saying you voice doesn't matter to the government. 
7199	"They took away the right as an American they gave you in the first place. Popular vote should replace the Electoral College. There have been instances where the popular vote reined supreme, but the Electoral College didn't agree. In the article, ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" it mentions an election where Al Gore lost even though he won the popular vote. ""...according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore-thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency..."" This helps show the people that it seems our vote isn't what is truly important, it's only what the Electoral College does that makes a true impact on choosing of president for the next two years. It's even stated in the very same article that, ""...over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" If our vote truly matters then why not vote on keeping the Electoral College in play or getting rid of the flawed system once and for all. "
7200	The Electoral College is unfair, unjust, and unamerican. The system takes away our right to vote for who we want not who we want to vote for us. If you are a true American you will understand why I know this is flawed. The Electoral College is not a proper way to handle our votes it must be a vote decided completely by the people of Amercia.    
7201	Your on a trip to california from indiana and your afraid to fly so you drive with the new driverless car. You get bored because you dont have to do anything,and your getting tired. So you fall asleep in the car; up ahead there is a broken bridge and your car couldnt wake you up and you missed the detour because your car was incapable of doing its job. Fortunatly your car has a sensor to that aplies the brakes when the driver does not wake up and take the wheel. 
7202	I think that people shouldn't have to do community service unless they get into legal trouble such as a fight, and they are charged with assault. Or if someone steals something and they are charged with stealing. 
7203	we should really be doing things that can help ourselves and do community service whenever we want. Because if you force someone to do something, we wont like it. 
7204	Smart cars require quite alot of preperation for something that is so underwelming. 
7205	Same thing goes for investing money into cars that are incredibly slow and dumb when compared to us. 
7206	Lastly, smart cars aren't guranteed to not crash or accidently run off a bridge because it couldn't see that the bridge had been demolished later that day. 
7207	Smart cars may be smart, but that doesn't make them better. Smart cars have to guess and assume what will happen based on what they were told by their programming. 
7208	Even though driverless cars are possible doesn't make it cheap. 
7209	Finally we get to the main issue with self driven cars, are they safe 
7210	I am writing this lettter to talk about how the Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational. 
7211	First, the Electoral College is unfair to voters 
7212	Second, there could be a tie in the electoral vote. 
7213	Last, the voters are merely voting for the slate of electors rather than the president. 
7214	"Because of the ""winner-take-all system in each state"", the candidates don't take time to go to other states that they know they will lose, they only really focus on the ""swing"" states. For example, during the 2000 campaign, seventeen statesdidn't see the candidates in their state at all, also 25 of the largest media markets had not seen a single campaign ad from a candidate. Also it's unfair because voters don't really know who to vote for because they see no campaign ads and candidates don't show up to their state and tell them what he/she is running for. That's why the Electoral College is unfair to voters of the presidential election. "
7215	"For instance, if you ""lived in Texas and wanted to vote for John Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry."" The worst part is that the electors could be anyone you don't even have to hold a political position to be an elector, they could be very biased and narrowminded. That's why the Electoral College is unfair. "
7216	In conclusion Mr. Senator the Electoral College is unfair, outdated, and irrational because it is unfair to voters, there could be a tie in the electoral vote and the voters are merely voting for a slate of electors and not there president. 
7217	These cars will just help fuel americas lazy lifestyle. 
7218	Having cars the drive themselves will take all of the fun out of driving. 
7219	Automatic cars are not safe, 
7220	I think that if the companies keep working and progressing on the safety issues with the automatic vehicles then maybe these automatic cars can be a good thing. 
7221	The American lifestyle, some might say that it is hardworking and free, others howeveer might say that we are lazy. I have to agree with both, we have many citizens that are very hardworking and strive to do their best and improve themselves and others. Sadly that is not all of out citizens, we have a gigantic amount of people in our contry that are lazy, they do not want to work for anything, and expect everything in life to be given to them without them putting forth any more effors than applying for some things online. If the automobile manufactorers release a car that drives itself, that will just be one more thing that the lazy americans do not have to do. It would be another thing just handed to them that they would not have to work for. These cars are made by the hardworking to make life for the lazy easier. I do not think that this is something that needs to happen or something that should even be considered. 
7222	When I get in my car and just drive, it is always fun. The feeling of being free and being able to go wherever you want and just to be able to drive is amazing. I think that many people love to drive and if we made automatic cars the manual cars would start to dissappear. Making many people upset and many others miss out of the wonders of driving. Diving a car can help build and develop many skills that can be helpful in every day life and even at work. Driving can help you develop your reflexes and your ability to spot details and be somewhat predictive of what others might do. That can help with plenty of jobs including sports. Learning to drive a car is one of the memories that you will remeber forever. If we have automatic cars then we will miss out on those memories. 
7223	"These automatic cars can not handle anything besides normal road conditions or even pulling in and out of driveways. ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents"" (Driverless cars are coming, author unknown). These cars have been built to alert the driver when they need to take over the vehicle, but are still not capable of functioning without a human driver, which could be a safety hazards. If the vehicle is not able to handle the road conditions ahead it will attemp to notify the driver inside, but considering it is an automatic vehicle the driver may have fallen asleep due to the lack of entertainment of activities to keep them alert and then the car nor the driver is able to manuver the obsticles ahead and the could cause an accident resluting in the death of anyone involved. "
7224	Driverless cars are coming, and they are going to be dangerous. Driverless cars are coming and they stilll have a lot of issues to work through that could be dangerous. Driverless cars are going to reward the lazy for being lazy, and make them have to do even less work. Taking away the need for human drivers in vehicles will take away great memories, fun adventures, and many valuable skills that peple can gain while driving a car. These cars also can cause many safety issues including accidents from the lack od the cars ability to handle certain situations and could also cause issues if the drivers of these cars fall alseep when there is a sitiuation where there is a need for a human driver. RIght now these cars do not have enough safety features and they do not have enough driving capability to be safe for public use. If the manufactoring companies continue to work on these cars and make improvements, then these cars might not be completely bad, but as of right now they are not safe enough or skillled enought to be sent out to the pubic. 
7225	"there is a huge concern over who's vote is the real vote, Americas, or the Electoral College ""Your vote counts"" is what the citizens of America always hear when it is finally time to vote. But does it really count the way that it should? The tuesday after the first monday in November, everyone is going crazy lining up outside of the voting polls and waiting to make their vote count for who they want their new president to be. But are they really voting for a President or a state of electors? "
7226	That proves that many peoples vote doesnt count. If more people voted for Gore thats what the people of America wanted and there was proof. So it was very unfair how Bush won because of electoral votes. 
7227	for instance some people think that community service takes time and energy that they don't have it really makes it impossible for them to do anything. 
7228	Can you imagine trying to balance band practice, basketball practice, play practice and community service you might manage for a couple of days but after a few days you will be getting very tired and it would be very hard to manage all of that. 
7229	Also some people don't live near the community and still go to this school which isn't bad but it sure isn't good when you have to do community service for this community not the one you live in. 
7230	That would make it partially impossible for you to do everyday and some people have split parents (divorced) which means they are already moving back and forth between them they don't need to be having to go to community service things at the community that they might not even be in at the time, it would screw up the schedules of the parents of the kids and it would put a lot of pressure on the kids to make sure they get it right every time they have to do it. 
7231	I also see the other side of it on how if we have community service it can bring families together to do something nice for the community. 
7232	A very popular topic that has been floating around in recent political conversations is the process, or in more familiar terms: fairness, in the steps used in the Electoral College to select a President for the United States of America. Or, perhaps ironically so, lack therfore of directly selecting a President. It is this particular topic that has inquired me to send you this letter regarding the upcoming debate: Should the Electoral College Stay Or Go?  Now don't get me wrong here: I legitimately don't believe anything I say could really have a major impact on any type of consideration towards this debate, I just hope you read this and ponder it's words to fully make a positive choice-whichever path you choose to side with in this. 
7233	The popular vote allows people to vote on what president they want to vote for, 
7234	First and formost, it is my belief that we should keep the electoral college because,it has been around for so many years so the question is why consider changing it now 
7235	Are you the kind of person that is really interested in political stuff? Politics can be a subject that will start fights, but not everyone is so interested. You must know what the electoral college is. It is a system where when you vote for your president you are actually voting for a group of electors that will then vote for the president(Source 1). This means that even if there is a majority in the popularity vote from the people. The electoral college can over rule that and vote for the other. 
7236	I say the electoral college is a bad system and it needs to be extinguished. 
7237	There is no doubt that you should get to decide who your leader will be. And if the electoral college can over rule your vote do you really feel like it's your decision? 
7238	In the 2000 presidential race, Al Gore lost because he recieved the most popularity votes from the people but the electoral college voted for Bush instead(Source 2). This means that the people thought Al Gore should be the president but instead they didn't get what they wanted because the electoral college thought otherwise. Do you think this is in anyway fair? The majority of the country ended up unhappy with the election because of ther electoral college. I say that alone is enough reason to abolish the electoral college. If it happens once it can happen again. Do you want to feel cheated and betrayed again? Let's get rid of the electoral college! 
7239	"Some others may say that they support the electoral college because it can't have a tie. ""Because almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality ina state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state.""(Source 3) "
7240	It is still possible to have a tie though because there are 538 total votes and since that is an even number then it can happen. And if there is just a stlight difference and instead the electoral college creates a landslide then that isn't representing the actuall number of the votes by the people. Once again you are being cheated out of your sya it the election. The hardest thing to understand is why people would still support something that doesn't support them. The electoral college basically throws away your votes and replaces them with theirs. And once again, it is possible for ties in the electoral college due to the even number of votes. 
7241	"""Because each state casts only one vote, the single representative from Wyoming, representing 500,000 voters, would have as much to say as the 55 representatives from California, who represent 35 million voters.""(Source 2). This alone shows that your votes are being represented equally. It is saying that 500,000 votes are equal to 35 million votes. Isn't it obvious that those two numbers are very different and they could have a very large effect on the popularity of each canidate that they are voting for? but instead they have they same effect and the 34.5 million voters that don't get their fair say could very possibly be unhappy with the turnout of the president. The people are supposed to be the ones that vote for their leader, not a group of 538 ""qualified"" polititians that can over rule the entire country's vote. "
7242	There are supporters who say that they support the electoral college because it avoids run-off elections. Because even if there is a tie in the majority votes from the people it is unlikey for there to be a tie in the votes from the electoral college. 
7243	"""For example, Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority in the electoral College...""(Source 3). "
7244	In my opinion if there is a tie in the popularity votes then they should revote, it may take longer but it will still be a decision by the people. Just because it makes the procces faster doesnt mean it makes the procces better. They can create a better system in the event of a tie instead of electors over ruling the people and picking whoever they think is best. That isnt government for the people, by the people. 
7245	In conclusion, the electoral college needs to be extinguished for many reasons. those reasons are because it doesn't let the people vote for who they want and it over rules a notions votes. And because it doesnt show the number of votes as equall. Some may say that it is good because it prevents a tie but if there is a tie then I'm sure htere are better ways to revote. we need government for the people, by the people and that isn't what the electoral college is.   
7246	As a deadly disease, COVID-19, sweeps across the globe many school systems are looking to a extend period of time were the majority of their students will be in isolation. One way that school systems have attempted to avoid set backs in education during this time has been the use of online education resources. This system is effective in times were students can not physically attend school but would have catastrophic results if implemented into long-term plans. Although many supporters of online education would argue that it reduces the likelihood, and effect, of social problems that are commonly seen in schools, 
7247	distance learning would cause major problems to students and destroy the positive developments the current education system has encourage. 
7248	Some of the developments that would be removed from the education system are: an equal access to physical school resources across the school, 
7249	The problems that education faces across the country may be chronic, but schools still provide an equal access to help outside of the classroom across the school. 
7250	A major resource that all students have access to is a school library. In some communities school libraries are the only libraries students have access to so they are the sole gateway to information outside of classes. Another resource is students access to teachers, this is critical to their learning and allows for them to conference about difficulties they are facing in the class. Most current forms of online school would eliminate teacher conferencing from schooling though. Finally some areas of the country lack internet access for many reasons. In these areas the implementation of online schooling would be impossible without major invest by the school system which in most likely is underfunded. The physical resources that can only be present at a school serve as a strong argument against online schooling. 
7251	With the implementation of online schooling the ability for students to participate in extracurriculars is immediately called into question. 
7252	Without a physical building to meet in everyday many extracurriculars lack the funds to rent out a separate property and would quickly fold. Even students that were invested in an after school activity before a switch to online schooling occurred would face the difficulty in their ability to travel to the new meeting place of their activity. Many students do not have access to a car, either for financial or legal reasons (they do not have a license yet), so busing is the only way these students are able to travel to and from the school. With online schooling this busing would no longer be consistent and many after school activities would see huge drops in participation or fold entirely. This would be detrimental to the students who any have the talents to successes in other activities outside of the school. This would limit the opportunities students have causing the diversity of experiences the rising generation would have.  
7253	Although schools can issue computers that can only access education resources, 
7254	This is a challenge that many home school students have had to face but they are better equipped to solve this problem. Home schooled students typically get around distractions by having a dedicated space for school. This works for the typically wealthier home school students whose families can afford an extra room in the house. This solution is next to impossible to maintain in cities or impoverished areas were all the rooms in a given house are taken up, or potentially over used. 
7255	"The implementation of online schooling would destroy one of the greatest aspects of traditional schooling, the ""learning environment"". "
7256	Many supporters of online education say that it significantly reduces the chances of social problems that arrive from traditional schooling such as bullying. 
7257	There are two main fallacies in this argument: first, that bullying can still happen outside of school; and second, that this sheltering makes it easier for bullying to occur later in life. 
7258	Cyberbullying has become an ever greater threat to students and schools have been largely unequipped to deal with the problem head on. Online schooling would only magnify the problem by allowing problems to go undetected with the school having limited access to what is going on only when students are logged into a computer. The second problem arises from the transition that students make from high school to college. This serves as a difficult time for students already with hazing, bullying, and other bad social behaviors occurring. If a student is sheltered for all of their public education, from kindergarten to 12th grade, they are exposed to this harsh environment without the social skills or experience required to navigate these turbulent times. Instead of stopping the problem of bulling, online education only seeks to kick the problem further down the road. 
7259	"Online education as a whole may appear promising in its abilities to ""level the playing field"" but it instead, if implemented, would result in a regression on many of the fronts; namely: physical school resources, after school activities, and the benefits from a dedicated school building. This would make the ""playing field"" of education only more uneven. As the COVID-19 virus sweeps across the country and schools must look to online schools for a time, it will be necessary for schools to remember the benefits of traditional education and see online schooling as only a temporary fix. "
7260	Students would benefit from being able to attend classes at home 
7261	it increases the students ability to focus knowing they're in a safe place 
7262	creates less distractions like there would be in a classroom 
7263	it would help the student complete work faster without having to travel from classroom to classroom.  
7264	To begin with, attending school online at home is very beneficial, in some cases especially to certain students. It increases the ability to focus. This is because the student would know they are in a safe and comfortable place, which is the most important reason. 
7265	Continuing on, bullying has been a serious issue in today's society. It has come to a point where students feel unprotected in a place where their parents and teachers may think they feel safe. School is portrayed as a safe environment and should be. Although, in some situations it is not and many students have dealt with bullying in a learning environment. Bullying makes it difficult for any student to come to school focused and feel comfortable with who they are. Adding on to this reason, school shootings are another very important problem for why it is safer for students to attend online school at home. This dangerous act shatters the idea of any school being safe knowing someone could get hurt or worse. Attending online school helps avoid these kinds of situations. 
7266	Furthermore, staying at home all day and everyday decreases the student's chances to get distracted from their education. 
7267	Continuing on, school online helps get work done faster without having to travel from classroom to classroom in a class for only an hour and a half or less. 
7268	It decreases the time to finish work at home rather than at school. Most online school programs offer as much time as you need on an assignment. Although, once you've started one there is of course, a deadline. Attending online school at home is very benefitial in this reason because it would make it easier for the student. On that note, if a student were to be having trouble with an assignment online they would be able to turn it in once they have understood it completely or if not the student could move on to another subject and come back to it. That is what makes online school at home very helpful and beneficial. In a classroom that would not be possible, in some cases, they would have no other choice but to turn it when needed to and accept the consequences. 
7269	Critics would argue that if students get home schooled they wouldn't get to go out explore the real world. Also, they would fear to talk to people they don't know and only talk to people they do know and that would affect the way the interact with others and could effect the way they attend colleges or interviews for jobs or colleges 
7270	Driverless cars seem like an impossibility.  They seem like something out of a futuristic movie or comic book.  However, today's evidence proves that driverless cars are a realistic possibility.  Advancements in technology today provide tangible evidence that driverless cars could play a prominent role in the near future. 
7271	they are more efficient, 
7272	would increase safety 
7273	would increase the quality of life for drivers. 
7274	 Driverless cars are much more efficient.  
7275	Also, Driverless cars are safe.  
7276	The biggest problem with driverless cars is that it is difficult to enable them to manuever around unexpected problems like car accidents or construction areas. 
7277	However, driverless cars are now able to notify the driver when he or she needs to take over the controls in trecherous situations 
7278	Finally, driverless cars would increase the quality of life for the driver.  
7279	"In tedious situations like a traffic jam, driving is boring and energy wasting.  However, driverless cars can take away the exhausting driving experience and allow the driver to relax.  For example, ""Traffic Jam Assistant"" will be very helpful to anyone in a traffic jam because it would take away the boredom of driving in a traffic jam.  Traffic Jam Assistant enables the car to handle driving functions up to 25 miles per hour.  This would be very helpful in a long and tedious traffic jam because one does not drive over 25 miles per hour in a traffic jam.  Also, if taxis could be driverless cars, the quality of life for the average citizen would increase.  Taxis would cost less money, they would be open more often, and they could take passengers to farther destinations.  This would dramatically increase the quality of life for all people and it would make owning a car almost antiquated.  this would provide much finacianal saving for the average person and it would provide a great deal of convinience for the average person as well.  "
7280	In my personal oppinion I think it's best to keep the Electoral College. 
7281	"""It avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of vote cast."" as stated in the article by Richard Posner. It balances the votes by a larger state compared to a smaller state. In article ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to kep our despised method of choosing the President"", the author states that a larger state has more popular votes rather than a small state. The author says this, ""The popular vote was very close in Florida [in 2012]; nevertheless Obama, who won that vote, got 29 electoral votes. A victory by the same margin in Wyoming would net the winner only 3 electoral votes."" As that being said, the author is explaining how larger states get more attention from a presidential candidates in a campain than a small state does. This is when the Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment. "
7282	"As said in the article, ""What Is The Electoral College?"", ""The Electoral College process consists of the selection of the electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress."" That is a huge amount of work but that is what keeps the elections well organized. Each candidate running for President in a state has their own group of electors. After each election, the governor of your state prepares a certificate presenting all of the candidates that ran for your state. As stated in the article by the Office of the Federal Register, ""The Certificate of Ascertainment also declares the winning presidential candidate in your state and shows which electors will represent your state at the meeting of the electors in December of the election year."" The Electoral College is what mantains everything professional. "
7283	"For example, many people believe their vote goes to waste. As stated in the article by Richard Posner, ""Democrats in Texas, for example, or Republicans in California. Knowing their vote will have no effect, they have less incentive to pay attention to the campaign they would have if the president were picked by popular vote."" Voters want to feel involved and have interest in the political system. People also fear the tie in an electoral vote. They feel like the government will choose whoever will benefit them the best and they won't take the people into consideration. In article, ""The Indensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong"", the author says the electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. He believes it's anachronism. "
7284	"When hearing about the Electoral College, most people think of a group of individuals casting votes based on the popularity of the candidate in their state. What they don't know is that ""the Electoral College is a process, not a place""(source 1) Some people, like Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and Bob Dole, have all thought that the Electoral College should be abolished and be replaced by the popular vote. According to a poll taken in 2000, 60 percent of voters believe the precidency should be decided on the popular vote (source 2). "
7285	After thoroughly researching, the Electoral College should be replaced by the popular vote. 
7286	The current system of electing isn't exactly democratic 
7287	there is a chance for there to be a tie in the votes. 
7288	"Most states have a ""winner-takes-all"" system (with the exception ofMaine and Nebraska) that awards all electors to the winning presidential candidate in their state.(source 1) There may be an arguement that no state has enough votes to give the presidency to someone; however, this system basically casts away the other votes of those on the side of the opposing candidate, making it undemocratic. Besides that, there is also the chance that a few of the electors go rouge and vote for the opposing candidate. "
7289	To be a democracy means to  listen to the voice of the people; however, the college may not always listen. 
7290	The electoral College consists of 538 electors, meaning that the possibility of there being a tie is likely. 
7291	When there is a tie, the fate of the potential presidents lie in the House of Representatives. When the election results are in the hands of the House, the selection can hardly be expected to reflect the will of the people. It will be more likely that they will vote for the candidate in their party rather than listen to the people's vote. Not only does it ignore the rights of the people, but this gives an unfair advantage to the candidate who's party is currently in power.  
7292	"The author says ""faithless electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please"" (Plumer 11). Going into this further, that means that one person can disagree with hundreds of people's votes for his own vote of the opposite party. Also, if a tie was to occur int the total electoral votes then the outcome would be put into the hands of the House of Representitives. If the people were to vote in the first place this occurance would have never came close. "
7293	On the other hand, it is much harder to calculate the total number of the  popular vote being that there are millions of people voting. It is much easier to count and not dispute over a hundred or so votes than a million. 
7294	I agree that kids should have to do community service because it builds character 
7295	In the past people helped each other get things done and it wasn't uncommon to see a child walking an old lady across the street. Now kids try to push people out of the way so they can get across the street. 
7296	community service will help with is kids learning how to be courteous to their elders and also their piers 
7297	some kids don't know ow to act in public and be respectful but once community service starts to become a regular thing they will be. It will also help communities grow with each other so that everybody will start to get to know each other and work together. 
7298	I think a good addition to this system would be some type of reward system that would give kids motivation to actually do the community service 
7299	It will teach kids how to get things done and done the right way and that will also factor in with school and how kids do on homework or projects and even studying for test which will really prepare them for highschool and college 
7300	Driverless cars have always been a fascinating idea in televison, but they seem to be dangerous, expensive, and interface with the law. 
7301	Driverless cars are amusing to those who look forward to this new technology, and its unreal and amazing that a car drive it's self, but is it safe? 
7302	"""Driverless cars"" at the time seem to already struggle with the navigation and attention of the driver to prevent accidents from occuring. As stated by the article, "" This means the human driver must remain alert and be ready to take over when the situation requires."" Driverless cars today aren't all that beneficial and requiredue the attention of drivers, how can we be positive that the new cars said to come will be ready to prevent accidents without the requirence of human attention? Not only do these cars seem to be safeless, but due to all that worl that is said to come and all the new technology, dont they seem expensive and out of reach? "
7303	The driverless cars are said to come, but with the technology that will be invested into this project, it seems to be out of reach from those who are interested. 
7304	Driverless cars amuse the world with the idea that they will soon be here and will require no human at the wheel, but say it doesnt turn out well and the car is invlolved into an accident what will happen? 
7305	"Who will be responsible for the occurence that has happened? As stated by the article, "" If the technology fails and someone is injured, who is at fault--the driver or the manufacturer?"" If all fails, what will the law say and who is to be blamed for? Laws will need to be undated with the upcoming driverless cars, as stated by the article, "" ...in order to cover the liability in the case of an accident."" Even with laws updated, not every state is allowing the testing of the new cars to come, knowing that they are unsure of the safety of others. "
7306	Also some people need to call their legal guardian and ask them if they can stay after school, to study, do a project, or watch a sports game after school. Since the school won't let them call home and ask they either don't go or go and don't call home. 
7307	If a student is doing poorly in a subject they do not particularly care for, the sport they participate in after school makes them feel better about what they do. It also gives them incentive to do better in the subject they aren't doing so well in.  
7308	An alternative to taking away the sports all together would be to set up a tutoring group made up of students helping other students having similar interests in school and outside of school 
7309	"More and more frequently, classrooms across the country are embracing technology. From laptops distributed to the student body to 3D printers, technology changes, and education changes with it. Today, the United States is at a point where it can safely be said that, most likely, every school in the country has computers. This is an era of communication unlike the world has ever seen. Some schools even allow distance learning via online and video conferencing. A common question asked is ""Is home learning a good thing?"" To answer that question, not exactly. "
7310	Learning through online attendance of a class can be a good thing, but for many students, it can devoid them of the attention and social interactions they so desperately need. 
7311	To start, online learning would be especially detrimental to ADHD learners 
7312	ADHD is short for Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder. Though it is different for everyone with it, the most common symptoms are fidgeting, high levels of activity, struggling to sit still/cope with boredom, a short attention span, and on top of that, being very easily distracted (I can back up this, as I have ADHD myself) . In their own home, distractions would be everywhere for an ADHD student, and going further, often ADHD students need structure, which working from home cannot give them. ADHD students often benefit from one-to-one help. which working online can't give them. Students without ADHD can have the same problems.  
7313	Many schools in America are already under-funded, and wouldn't be able to afford the extra cost. Along with that, the students and their parents might have to buy their own laptops and such to go online with, which not everyone can afford. A wireless connection is another problem for those families, as a good plan can cost anywhere from about 20 dollars per month to 90 per month. That is 240 to 1800 dollars per year, and many families can't afford that. 
7314	To conclude, this is a very nuanced issue. Many students would benefit from this, but just as many, if not more, would suffer through their education. There is a clear course of action presented, however. Have classes of people working from home, akin to an online conference room, and have regular classes for the others, leaving it up to the students to decide. Though it can be harmful, if implemented right, it can help a great many students who might not get nearly as good of an education otherwise. 
7315	little Johnny can relate with the problem of having a dirty town. Little Johnny was walking home from school one day when he noticed a gum rapper on the gray sidewalk, he picked it up and threw it in the garbage can. he continued walking home when he saw another gum rapper on the sidewalk. he picked it up and put it in the garbage. a few minutes later he saw another gum rapper on the sidewalk. but this time he was mad so he ignored it. that afternoon he told his mom and dad about what happened after school, and they said it didn't matter, and that it is not there problem. the next day he was walking home from school when he found another gum rapper on the sidewalk, so he pick it up and brought it home to his mom and dad and the all wrote a letter to the major of his town saying that they should pick up all of the trash on the ground. and they did. 
7316	Voting has been a legal write of all people since our country was established, but is the way we vote recieving some resistance? The electoral college is the way we vote now and the way weve been doing it for years. So why change it? For the sake of fairness and accuracy. 
7317	People from all around the country don't think that the electoral college is a intelligent way of voting. So they are fighting changing the electoral process to popular vote rather than voting for a state of electors 
7318	"What Is the Electoral College?  "" states, ""Consider that state legislatures are technically responsible for picking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people."" This is basically saying we can't trust our electors to really vote for what they are assigned. That is like not being able to rely on the school bus to take you to school in the morning, its not a great sense of doubt "
7319	Another reason not to use this outlandish method of voting is that the total number of electoral votes (538) is an even number. 
7320	The electoral college should be abolished. It has caused nothing but problems for us in the past years. From ties, to innacuracy of votes, to causing re-counts. The electoral college is not putting America in the right direction. Most people don't like change, I am one of those people. Although, this change is for the better. And it should be strongly considered in the comig years 
7321	Community service is important in the world because it helps support ideas like cleaning up our neighborhood to helping the needy. If we didn't have community service, the world may not be a place like it is today. But, everyone has to consider that it is a persons preference to choose to do community service and that they are not forced to do it. Our principal may be doing a good deed in saying that everyone should have to do a certain number of hours of community service, but some people may not be able to and they shouldn't be forced to do any work that they don't have to. 
7322	So i believe that the principal of my school shouldn't make this rule about community service. 
7323	One of the reasons that i think that his rule shouldn't be passed is because community service is important but it's only volunteer work that you should volunteer for and not have to be forced to do it. 
7324	This is because i know from experience how hard it is to keep up with school work and how stressful sports, school, and family can be for a kid my age. Adding community service to this is not a good idea because i think that it may cause unneeded stress on stressed out kids that may not have the time to do this community service. so i believe that community service should not be forced upon kids of all ages. 
7325	This is because kids study after school and do homework and are over their heads in homework sometimes and community service may lead to more missing homework and lower grades on tests and quizzes, especially during the end o the marking period when the quarterly assessments are the most important and also the biggest test out of all of them. Community service would not be a good choice for the students at SCHOOL_NAME because of these reasons. 
7326	The final reason that i think forced community service is not a good idea is because kids need sleep. 
7327	Without sleep, kids would do horrible in school and wouldn't be able to keep themslves awake. this would lead to drops in grades and would also lead to poor behavior in school because of lack of sleep. The reason community service may alter sleeping habits is because some communtiy service may require extra time in the evening which would keep the workers up late at night depriving them of sleep, which would be very bad. Community service would not be a good idea for SCHOOL_NAME because it would affect so many aspects of childrens lives. 
7328	Hmm community service ? well i think that it is important because if people litter eventually out earth is going to be a total mess and the WILL be garbage everywhere , it would be a great task to do after school or on free time and importantly if you would be helping a student our education progress will most likely go up like fire works at the park on fourth of July 
7329	To begin with , i think i strongly agree for us students to be required to do community service because we are the kids from the future and our earth will become a total dump . 
7330	I mean kids do have the strength to go around when the have free time and pick up trash for a local park or maybe as a class field trip go to the beach and pick up all the nasty litter people leave their it would be a win , win situation because in out win we will have a progress to a better earth and better place to live and the other win would have to do with the animals out in the ocean , the would also have ea better home and a cleaner place to live . The already going threw an oil spill i honestly don't think the need any more thing in their water . For an example think to yours self would you like to live in water and other people come and just throw things in your 'home' ? didn't think so , neither do i and neither do they . 
7331	High school is a very difficult environment for kids to learn in. Most kids are too busy trying to fit in or look cool, so they can be part of a clique. Teenagers are also pressured into making bad decisions and do not have time to study or work on anything at home because they dont have the time with all the homework they get 
7332	Most high schools start at around 7:30 forcing their students to wake up at 6 sometimes 6:30 or 7 but yet they also give out homework that can keep them up till 3 AM. Students also have to get jobs to pay for their cars or gas and are still expected to do their homework. Giving homework is not fair to the students at all 
7333	Everyone should have the equal opportunity to attend public school. Due to unfortunate circumstances some students don't receive this equal opportunity, and they can not attend public school with their peers. By offering distance learning courses to all students this issue could be resolved. A program like the distance learning program would give every child the chance to go to public school if they wish. The program would be simple; students could attend school from home via online or video conferencing. If more schools were to adopt this simple solution more students would be able to go to school and learn alongside their peers. 
7334	because students and their families would not have to worry about transportation to and from school 
7335	some students are too anxious about going to a public school, 
7336	Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because students and their families would not have to worry about transportation. 
7337	The journey to school is different for every student. For some an easy five minuet walk will get them to school with no worries, others a fifteen minuet bus ride, and for few a treacherous path lies between their house and their nearest public school. This situation could prevent a child from attending a public school at all, or make it very difficult to attend everyday. The family shouldn't have to move from the house they love for their children to attend school. The distance learning program would be able to fix this situation. Fortunately for the family, with the distance learning program, the student would be able to video conference the schools from the comfort of their home. Personally, I know a program like this would benefit families like my cousins family who lives far out of the way and struggles to drive to school every morning because public school transportation does not go far enough to reach where they live. This program would take the stress off the family and continue to allow the student to attend public school. 
7338	In addition to taking the stress off families about transportation, students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because some students are too anxious about going to a public school. 
7339	Due to recent events, the anxiety of there being a school shooting has gone up in many students. Some students live in fear of being in the next school shooting. For some the anxiety is overwhelming and it makes the student no longer want to physically attend public school. This anxiety could also become distracting while in the public school setting taking the students attention away from learning and instead worrying about the possibility. This should not be a reason any student is unable to learn how any other student would in a public school. With the distance learning program students with this anxiety would be able to virtually attend school with peace of mind from their home. Programs like the distance learning program would help give more students peace of mind which would help a lot in times like these.  
7340	Lastly, students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because for some students it is their only option 
7341	For some students schooling from home is their only option. For example some students have health issues preventing them from attending public school. They could be too sick or vulnerable to be around all the other students. Although for many of these students they wish to attend public school with their peers to feel like every other student their age. The distance learning program would be giving these students the opportunity to study among their peers in a public school setting. While some may say the video conferencing would be a distraction to students, it would be giving students who are unable to attend public school physically the chance to learn the way all other students who can attend public school physically do.  
7342	In conclusion, students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because students and their families wouldn't have to stress over transportation to and from school, some students are too anxious about going to a public school, and for some students it is the only option. This program would benefit not only students but also the school in many ways. Plus there are little to no downsides. Don't you think every student should have the equal opportunity to learn just like everyone else? Every child should have the chance to attend public school any way they can. 
7343	When using the Electoral College you have an exact percentage of the outcome of the votes, no guessing or estamating. The Electoral College has a method of awarding electoral votes, inducucing the candidates to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states. This is because voters in toss-up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign, making it easier for the candidates to study what the certain states needs are and convincing them that if they vote for them, their needs will be met. 
7344	Some may say that the winner-take-all system isn't fair to some states because most of the candidates don't even bother going to the states that they know they have no chance in winning. 
7345	Well this can be argued by saying that this method may help the candidates because if they know that they have no chance in winning in some states, they might specifically prepare a certain speech that may persuade the state to vote for them. Also no voter's vote swings a national election. 
7346	The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have a trans-regional appeal. This means if the voter is from the south, they have no reason to campaign heavily in those sates. Instead they can spend more time in states that need a little more convincing fot the candidate to gain their vote. It also restores some of the weight in the political balance that a large states loses by virtue of the mal-appotrionment of the Senate decreed in the constitution 
7347	Some may say that the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote is something to worry about. 
7348	But the Electoral College avoids the problem of there being a run-off election. If there was no Electoral College, this would put pressure for run-off elections, which would greatly complicate the presidential election process, which it invariably produces a clear winner. 
7349	So all in all, the Electoral College should be kept and stay the way it is. It isn't complicated and makes the election run more smoothly. It provides multiple ways for a candidate to win the vote of a certain state and avoids major problem during the election. 
7350	The freedom to make a hot cup of coffee while writing a book report, or watch a television series while doing math, undoubtedly sparks feelings of content among students. Throughout the country, some schools have worked to make this a reality, offering students the option of 'distance learning', which is a means by which students can take classes from home through online or video conferencing. In the 21st century, technological development is playing an increasingly larger role in several aspects of society, including educational institutions. The question of how and to what extent these innovations should be integrated serves as a subject for debate 
7351	One's home is, oftentimes, an environment which establishes a sense of comfort. This setting, compared to a classroom, removes the aspect of healthy competition among students and inhibits a student's drive to accomplish tasks through peer-to-peer interactions. 
7352	For example, to the student at home, his or her own grade is the highest, as it is the only point of comparison for him or her. However, at school, academic competition among peers allows for students to push themselves outside of their comfort zone, achieving their highest potentials. Additionally, the motivation of a student who takes classes from home is less than that of a student in a classroom as students at school are more exposed to the opportunities that other students have taken advantage of, such as sports and extracurriculars. This allows a student in school become motivated to simply engage in more activities and accomplish more in his or her fields of interest. The interaction that school promotes creates motivation among students and allows them to engage in healthy competition, while accomplishments more in their academic career.  
7353	Beyond this, distance learning allows for students to take advantage of their freedoms at home, which undeniably serve as a distraction to their academics. 
7354	For example, at home, a student may be tempted to watch television, or take a nap as there is no teacher or administrator to effectively enforce certain rules and guidelines on the student. This situation makes a student's ability to stay on task extremely difficult, hence negatively impacting that student's success academically. However, if the student were taking classes at school, they are required, by the teacher, to focus on the lesson and complete tasks in a timely manner for their grade. Taking classes at home allows a student to procrastinate their assignments, with no tangible consequence. Because of this, distance learning allows students to take advantage of their freedoms at home, which, in the long run, has a unfavorable effect on that student's academic success. 
7355	Furthermore, taking classes at home hinders students' development of social skills, which are beneficial to the success of individuals in the real world. 
7356	For example, students at school are frequently required to make presentations and connect with other students for group projects. At school, students can also ask their peers for help or advice on assignments. These opportunities at school sculpt a student's ability to develop imperative inter-personal skills, while promoting sociable behavior among students. Through distance learning, however, a student is not exposed to these situations; therefore, they are unable to make the same connections and develop these skills necessary for college or the real-life situations. 
7357	Although supporters of distance learning may argue against this point by claiming that taking classes at home could be made a possibility for younger students in elementary school as they are generally not required to give presentations, 
7358	this claim is unsupported as several important social skills are developed at a very young age, according to several studies regarding brain connections. Through distance learning, a student is unexposed to opportunities for developing integral social skills, which are necessary for his or her success in the future. 
7359	Distance learning, the concept of making at-home classes an option for students, is unsupported due to the fact that it does not promote the same motivation as a classroom, allows students to take advantage of their freedoms at home, and does not allow student's to develop their interpersonal skills. These factors would negatively influence a student's academic success, which is irrefutably counter-intuitive to the intended purpose of educational institutions.  
7360	I think it is a brilliant idea for us the students, to take on a opportunity to help out by doing community service 
7361	What would happen if after a while no one took care of our community? For an example It's like taking care of your room, what if one day you decided not to put things in there proper places and just threw things anywhere and left it untidy? It might begin to smell, or you might even discover things missing. So taking care of our community is like taking care of own self. Doing this could be a really good deed, giving back to the community to make it a healthier place. For example, maybe we can go 2-3 times a week picking up trash, even just starting with our own football field. 
7362	I have a couple reasons for saying that. First, under the electoral college system, voters don't vote for the president, they vote for a slate of electors who ends up voting for the president. 
7363	Second, you have to worry about the ties in the electoral vote.  
7364	"So that means you actually don't get to vote for the president you want, the electors get to vote for the  president they want and their choice might not be the same as yours. Here's an example that was in Source 1, ""If you lived in Texas, for instance, and wanted to vote for [John] Kerry, you'd vote for a slate of 34 Democratic electors pledged to Kerry."" So you don't actually get to vote for a president. Also, in source 2, it states that the electoral college is unfair to voters because of how each state has the winner-take-all system, candidates don't spend time in states they know they have no chance in winning, focusing only on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. "
7365	Source 2 states that if a tie happens, the election would be thrown to the House of Representatives, where state delegations vote on the president. The senate would choose the vice-president. The state delegations may not vote for the president you want and the senate may not vote for the vice-president you want either. 
7366	I think the Electoral College process is a bad idea and it should be changed to popular vote for the president of the United States. Electoral college is unfair to voters and I think it should be gotten rid of. 
7367	People in the United states have a voice of opinion towards voting,but in the end it is the electoral college that has the final say. To many americans voting is a very important event. The united states is a democracy. A democracy is a form of government where people have the say, The United States does not follow that route because of electoral college. Senator of the United States, 
7368	In conclusion Senate, Citizens of this country and I believe that we should put an end to the electoral college. Politicians even disagree with the idea of giving specific people to give the final vote. As senator you have the power to put a end to this unconstitutional doing. The United States is a democracy where everyone matters. Because of the electoral college our opinion on who should be elected has been taking away from us. this event is undemocratic and I ask you senator to think this through and take action on making this voting system to a popular voting system 
7369	Why do we vote? We vote so we can choose a candidate that we can trust to make the best decisions for our country. But what's the point of voting if we have an Electoral College. We are not actually voting to ellect a president, we are voting for electors, who elect the president. 
7370	"""Over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now."" This shows that more than half the voters, would rather just vote the president instead of having the Electoral College do it for them "
7371	But the Electoral College should stay up for certain reasons. 
7372	People should have their right to vote for who they think is best. That is why people are given the right to vote. The Electoral College just takes that right away. Presidents who win because of electoral votes, are not fairly chosen because, not many voters agreed on him, the electors did. The candidate that won popular votes, should be President, because most people agree on him and his choices. Let the people's votes count toward presidency. 
7373	I do not support this requirement, not because i think it is bad, but the time it would take would be too much for some students. 
7374	Some students are already very busy, and adding community service projects would just make it busier, and harder on them. 
7375	Some students play sports, and have practices every night, others have band rehearsals. On top of all that, they all have homework, putting required community service projects on top of all that would confuse us students, we would have trouble focussing on our academics if we have to worry about getting so many things done. 
7376	I myself am in many extracurricular activities, i play many sports, i play in the band, and i sing in the choir, i have a sports practice every night, and i have homework to do after that. To me, requiring community service would set me over the limit. I myself am already extremely busy every night, and having to worry about getting my community service projects done would be too much for me to handle. 
7377	i also have many friends that play many sports, and other things. We are all very busy already, we barely have enough time now to do even our homework. 
7378	I cant imagine how crazy my life would be if i had to practice sports every night, practice my musical instrument, and still find time in a week to do community service projects. 
7379	The electoral college is unfair, outdated, and irrational. The system has been around for milleniums from our founding fathers and the Constitution in the 1700s to present day America, it is critical that we update our system to a more realistic process where the citizens have more say in the leader we choose to lead us. 
7380	I am in favor in abolishing the Electoral College becasue most of the power should be held in the hand of the citizens and the popular vote should have more regards than the vote in Congress. 
7381	"I am not in favor in keeping the Electoral College because under the college system, voters don't vote for the president but for a slate elector, who in turn ""elect the president"" "
7382	When people go out of thier way to vote, they vote because they want to have a say in their potentially future. They vote for who they believe would lead our society and modern day world in the right direction. They would like to think that one vote could make a difference in a election, but with the Electoral College voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than vote who they actulally want to be president. 
7383	Under the Electoral College voters vote not for the president but for a slate of electors, who in return elect the president. In reality the people are not voting for the president they are putting their trust in somebody they vote to vote for the person they have choose to lead 
7384	"The process is unfair to the people because of the ""winner takes all"" system in each state the canidates dont take time in states in which they know have no chances of gaining them any power, they stay in states that are more benefically to them "
7385	"The canidates mostly focus on the tight races ocuring in the ""swing states"" in 2000 many states didnt even get to see the candiates because they were ""little, irrlevent, and worthless"" states. I'm sure many people in those sates such as South Carolina and Rhode Island had a lot of input to add in the 2000 campagin but because they were little minority states they werent focused on as much as the other larger staes. This is very unfair and judgementally to these states because the Electoral College is based on involuntary effects, the inhabitants of North Caiolina or Rhode Island cannot control where they choose to live, they might have to live in the certain geograpic location because of finaces or religous persecution. They may want to have a say in the election but cant because of their living arrangements. "
7386	The Electoral College is unfair in many different aspects we need to update our system of election, becasue like everything else in the world has an expiration date. Their is an expiration date on almost all of our food and beverages, an expiration date on salvery, an expiration date on our life, and so now we need an expiration date on the Electoral College.    
7387	"""The Electoral College is a process, not a place. The founding fathers established it in the Constitution as a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens""(Office of the Federal Register1). Thus, the Electoral College is a balance of votes that includes many different sources for which the President is elected "
7388	For this, the Electoral College should be retained due to its contribution to successful elections even though there are some instances which occur and to help the elections remain fair and equal. Additionally, this process should be continued, but there are certain aspects that would argue for changing the aged process. 
7389	"Posner explained theoretically, ""In [2012's] election, for example, Obama received 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 perecnt of the popular votes cast for him and Romney... even a slight plurality in a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state"" (Posner 1). With this, this shows that the state votes are important and essential to the canidates who are trying to obtain electoral votes in the states. Thus, this method or process is successful in ways many people do not aknowledge. The citizen's votes do matter, when every aspect is put into a big picture and taken into account. "
7390	"In The Office of the Federal Register's excerpt, ""What Is The Electoral College,"" there is certain reasons that further divulge how the Electoral College is fair and equal to the canidates and the citizens who are voting "
7391	"This is reliterated when The Office of the Federal Register statees, "" Your state's entitled allotment of electors equals the number of members in its Congressional Delegation: one for each member in the House of Representatives plus two for your Senators...(Office of the Federal Register 1). In addition this means that each state will receive an opportunity to have a meaningful vote to the elections because every state has the same kinds of members being awareded to them. Each state will have a different number of members due to the size, but they will all be of equal value to the canidates. To add for support, Posner says, ""No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president""(Posner 1). With this, all the states understand that their vote is crucial to the election and the canidates. Fortunately, the Electoral College is fair and equal to all the state's voting in the election, sometimes even more than some states know. For example, Posner states, "" Voters in toss up states are more likely to pay close attention to the campaign-to really listen tp the competing candidates-knowing that they are going to decide the election""(Posner 1).  Ultimately, the Electoral College is the most fair way to decide and vote for a future president who will be our leader of all the citizens. "
7392	"but there are some flaws. For example, Plumer explains, ""... Thanks to the quirks of the electoral college- won the popular vote but list the presidency over 60 percent of the voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now"" (Plumer 1). The elecotral college could alter the outcome of an election dramtically. Another issue that Plumer wants people to know is that, "" Under the electoral collge sysytem, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of electors..."" "
7393	"In conclusion, the Electoral College is very important to our modern day elections. The citizens and the states determine who the next Presidents will be. The process provides successful elecions which are fair and equal to not only the people, but the states. Posner states, ""Voters in presidential elections are people who want to express a poltiacl preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election"" (Posner 1). The Electoral College makes sure that every person and state vote is accounted for and will be contributed to who the next President will be. One day maybe there will be a process that will exceed the Electral College, but for now, we will trust our founding fathers and keep the process that has been with us since the start.        "
7394	Historically, children have only been able to receive an education by traveling to a building known as a school. In this building, there are classrooms, desks, boards, teachers, etc., but most importantly, the outlet to a successful future. Over time, more and more developments have been made in order to improve the quality of the curriculum that students learn in school. With the rise of technology, even the location of schooling has begun to vary with the addition of a unique option: learning from home. Online video conferences and other such facilities allow for students to access the same materials that they would be given at a traditional school 
7395	students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home, which is portrayed by the lack of three things that are vital to academic achievement: 
7396	First and foremost, being able to attend classes from home would result in a lack of student discipline. 
7397	Learning from home would discourage students from maintaining a strict schedule that would normally be upheld in a school building. For example, Generic_Name, a sixth grader, takes classes from home. The year before, he used to wake up at 6:00 every morning to get ready for school, which started at 8:00. Now, he wakes up around 9:00, because he only has four 90-minute classes to attend via video. While he may be able to get more sleep at night, Generic_Name has not established a routine for his school work, so he wastes hours before and in between classes. This leads to him not having enough time to spend with his loved ones or exercise, all because he has the leisure to slack off during the day. Consequently, there is not only a decrease in efficiency, but also in productivity, which is an outcome of the ability to attend classes from home. These are qualities of discipline, which is an indicator of success in the future. 
7398	Secondly, the direct connection to teachers would be lost if students were able to attend classes from home. 
7399	Although the video conferencing software might include a messaging system for students to communicate with their teachers, 
7400	it does not replicate the same level of understanding that a student might gain if they were able to speak directly to their teacher. 
7401	For instance, students who need clarification of certain material may not receive an adequate explanation online because their teacher's attention may be divided or focused on some other task. Additionally, in person, students would be able to ask follow-up questions and have a thorough discussion with their teacher, whereas a messaging system might not allow for steady communication due to breaks between answers. Therefore, there may be gaps in students' learning, which could contribute to poor performance in their classes. 
7402	Last but not least, the regulation of tests is lowered when students have the ability to attend classes from home. 
7403	When assessing students' learning in a tradtional school, teachers normally provide them with hard copies of multiple-choice or short answer questions that require students to write with a pencil or pen. With advancements in technology, however, tests are increasingly being administered through software to both avoid the wastage of paper and facilitate the process of grading. Learning from home usually requires students to take all of their tests online rather than on paper, which becomes problematic when there is no teacher or reliable adult proctoring the administration. This allows for cheating and other dishonest behaviors to occur, thereby decreasing the credibility of the scores of students taking tests from home. Test regulation is necessary for schools to accurately assess the academic performance of students, so a lack thereof is detrimental to society.  
7404	In conclusion, students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home due to the lack of student discipline, teacher connection, and test regulation. A combination of one or more of these factors can lead to a student not meeting the standards of learning, or even worse, the requirements for graduation from school. At home, students are not monitored regularly as they are at school, which is a breeding ground for incomplete lessons and assignments. Subsequently, grades plummet, and in many cases, so does the motivation to excel. In order for education to fulfill its purpose, students should attend school in a building separate from their home. By doing so, they would be subject to the benefits of character cultivation, as they learn not only the subjects normally taught in a curriculum, but also the value of hard work and its upward path to accomplishment in life.  
7405	Although most schools have normal education such as regular classes at school, other schools have something else in mind. Other schools have online classes that students are able to attend. I think the reasoning behind these online classes are because some students may have it difficult at school. 
7406	The majority of kids that are home schooled or take online classes are because of what goes on around them at school. Kids may not feel comfortable, not being able to get along with the people around them, and having trouble learning. Kids may find online classes a better way of education by concentrating and focusing more, rather than being distracted by other things around them at school such as kids disturbing them and the drama that goes on between students. 
7407	Also, some kids, including me, may not feel safe at school because of the things that have been happening to other schools like school shootings. School shootings have happened a lot around the world, because of situations like that, it leads students to not feel safe at school. Another reason a student may not feel safe at this school is because the way the school handles certain situations. Like every other school, there are drills, like lock down drills or fire drills. Some students may not want to go through real life drills and they fear a real one could happen. 
7408	Coming from a student , I support online classes. I support online classes because from my point of view it could be a solution to a lot of things to what goes on during school. 
7409	A few other reasons why students take online classes are because a student could be getting bullied. In some cases this is true, a student may not be getting the best education at a regular school because they're too scared to even go to school. At times, parents end up taking matters into their own hands by protecting their child from bullying and finding a solution like online classes 
7410	Another example on why kids may be taking online classes are because of what goes on in their life. Kids my age on social media that are influences are busy with the media . They create content or focus on other things in life that may not fit with a full schedule class at school so they choose to take online classes that way they learn on their own time and have time to work on their social media life 
7411	Lastly, failing a class. In some situations, students end up failing a class or classes and end up having to retake these classes online. Also, online classes is a great idea because it could help prepare students for college. Some students in college take online classes and do most of their work online, which will help the students that are still in school get prepared for college. 
7412	Overall, I dont see why online classes would be an issue; as long as you're learning and getting the same education as you would be getting at a regular school then everything should be alright. Although online classes is a topic that should be discussed between parents and the school, students should have a say in it as well because after all, it is apart of their education. My thoughts on this is that all schools should give a chance to have online classes because as i said, some kids may end up liking this way of education and learn better! I'm glad other schools have given the opportunity to let students experience different kinds of education. 
7413	I hope other schools get inspired by these online classes and give students a chance to try it out, because after all, a students education is what's most important.  
7414	what is this electoral college? You are telling me that i vote for electors thta supposedly are pulling fior my choice of candidate for pesident. I don't think that is right to just take my choice of president and put it in someone else's hands. It should be my choice to whom I want it to be. Now I realize that there is probably some rule that prevents them to changing their mind, but actually I don't think that there is such a rule. 
7415	It is the morning after the election, the sun is shining, the birds are singing, and you are joyful as can be, Why?  Last night's vote showed that your president that you wanted to win was going to be the next President of the United States of America.  You go to your laptop, open the screen, and there, in bold letters it says that the candidate you did not want to win was sitting there in the Oval Office.  You are in shock. Your friends call you and ask you what happened. Did something go wrong? Did we miss any extra votes last night?  You go look at the votes, they are still the same.  Then you relize that the Electoral College did not care what the people of this country said. The Electoral College did not care in one candidate had 100,000 more votes than the other.  All they wanted is everything to go their way.  
7416	I think we should get rid of the the Electoral College. And I know that many other people in this country would agree. I think that is should be changed to the popular vote for the President of the United States. 
7417	In my opinion, I believe Policy 1 is the better choice for our school. If cell phones are allowed to be used during free times and lunch, it would have a better effect on the students. 
7418	I believe that all students in school should take part in community service to help out their city, state, maybe even world. Students should at least have one day a week of community service 
7419	Many people may think that community service is hard work and kids our age shouldn't be doing this, they should be in school learning for a better education. 
7420	But if they all help in community service it may help them a long the road to keep a cleaner environment, and have a good say about your self for good jobs. 
7421	The more help you get cleaning the environment now, the less you have to later on in your life. 
7422	I support the developement of driverless/autonomous cars. Cars have been driven by human drivers so far and accidents are frequent and often violent. 
7423	If we had autonomous cars, we could almost completely eliminate human error altogether. 
7424	Autonomous cars would also be more efficient. 
7425	Autonomous vehicles would save lives and money. With a computer at the wheel, cars could find the most efficient and safe route to almost any destination. Greenhouse gas emmisions would be reduced, therefore making our planet a better place to be. 
7426	A new system of election must be created to make up for the pitfalls that are inevitable in the Electoral College. A country that is supposed to be a democracy does not have the voting system that such a proud democracy deserves. 
7427	Defenders of the College may say that the possibility of a tie is very low or that the  electors chosen are confirmed not to betray the wants of the voters, 
7428	but just because the possibility is low does not mean you can simply allow the flaws in the voting system to exist. A small hole in a fabric can only grow bigger, and the same goes for our electoral college. 
7429	If we can't repair or replace the fabric that is our Electoral College, soon there will be problems too big for us to deal with in our current state. The electoral voters may keep the public in mind for now, but there have already been cases where electoral voters put their own wants ahead of the public. 
7430	One thing that the Electoral College does not promote is the power in the hands of the people. Although people can vote for whatever candidate they want, the elector is the real deciding hand in the process of picking our president. 
7431	If one wanted to, an elector can completely disregard the decision of the voters and choose who they want. Considering the ratio of electors in some states to people, it seems completely non-democratic for the votes of some to be more important than the wants of the common people. Some start to feel that they shouldn't vote because their one vote wouldn't have the power to change anything, and wouldn't even ensure the election of the president they want. Another thing that lowers the morale is the absence of candidates in states that can't be won very easily. If a candidate is pretty sure he can't win over a state, he won't visit it because it wouldn't be worth his time. He also wil prioritize large states over small ones because they have more electoral votes. All of these can make a state or person feel as if the election isn't really in their hands, and when people feel like their vote doesn't matter, they don't vote. 
7432	Besides the power it takes away from the common man, some could say that the system itself is very inefficient compared to what it could be. Even though it has a very low possibility, the fact is that a tie is possible due to the electoral college having an even number of votes. 
7433	It would then go to the House of Representatives, who might not even have the want of the people in mind. Since most of the time Congress has a party that makes up a majority of it, it would be very unfair to allow them to pick the president. It's also possible that even if a majority of the people vote for a president, the electoral votes elect the other candidate instead, like what happened to Al Gore in 2000. An election like this just has too many holes and pitfalls to be efficient. The holes need to be repaired before we can actually use this as our primary way to select a president, or else we're setting ourselves up to have problems in the future. 
7434	The Electoral College may be functional, but is largely inefficient and is not in the best interest of the common people. The vote for a candidate is not even in the hands in the people, but rather a minority of chosen electors. In a country that prides itself on the power the people have, and the control they have on how their country is run, the people have surprisingly less influence than you would think. We as a people need to speak up against the overrated system that is the Electoral College, and develop a system that fits the needs of a true democracy like America should be.   
7435	Missing lecture days can be devastating for a student's course grade, however, some schools are implementing an online alternative. Constant access to previous lectures makes learning much easier and by allowing students to take courses online at home, this solution may resolve the previous issues with the school system. While working at home, students will also be able to work in a comfortable working environment with less classroom distractions 
7436	To begin with, flexible schedules are almost impossible to achieve while continuously attending classes at a desired location every week 
7437	Hundreds of colleges in the United States offer online courses to suffice the needs of students who have ludicrous schedules. Offering online classes to students will create space in their schedules leaving more time spent with family and extracurricular activities such as sports, clubs, etc. Many club competitions and sports tournaments interfere with school days ultimately throwing a student behind academically. The flexibility offered with online courses suits the needs of outgoing students who are constantly pressed by extracurricular activities.  
7438	Working in a familiar environment such as a bedroom with no distractions allows students to be more attentive to the online tasks at hand. 
7439	Many jobs in the information technology field allow remote access work from home. Taking this into account, this field of work tends to be extremely stressful but the option of working from home reduces the difficulty of getting projects done significantly. When this same online system is applied to school, the difficulty of getting school work done is also enormously reduced. 
7440	Finally, missing a day in school can be extremely devastating to a student's grade. 
7441	Adolescents who take a rigorous course load can fall behind as much as a whole unit, which can be taught in one day in advanced courses. The availability of classes online allows a student to review what they missed on the day they were supposed to be at school. Sick days are also roadblocks for students and the online course provides them something to look at while they relax at home. Once a student recovers from their sickness, they will have a general understanding of what they would have learned the day they missed.  
7442	In conclusion, online courses benefit students because it can create space in tight schedules, work in a zero distraction zone, and all lectures and notes are available online even when a student could not have made class that day. Online courses solve many problems that make school challenging for current students. Colleges are setting great examples of how to implement online courses that benefit students. Overall, the effect distance learning will have on school will be more advantageous than disadvantageous.  
7443	First of all, you require that everybody will be graded on how they help their community. Second, you have your students see how bad the community is in some places so that they want to help. Third, you reword them with maybe a dress down day. Fourth you have them do there service to the city during school so that the students don't take up their time to do things that they think are more important.  
7444	Ah, the electoral college. Don't you just  LOVE  how irrelevent, unfair, and confusing it is? In fact, it is so without flaw, that in 2000, Al Gore won the popular vote, but he lost the presidency (Source 2). Some people say that the electoral college is an anachronism, but some people disagree. Those people are wrong. The electoral college was irritating in the 1960's, and it's irritating now. 
7445	You should side with Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, and the Chamber of Commerce (Source 2), and abolish the electoral college. 
7446	most importantly, the electoral college is unfair to voters . 
7447	"Most states in the electoral college is based on a ""winner take all"" system; if the candidate gets the majority of votes in that state, that candidate gets the electors (Source 1). This means most candidates focus in on the states they know that they have a chance of winning, and focus on going after ""swing states"" (Source 2).  If a candidate was to get the majority in Texas, Florida, and California, the three biggest swing states, the candidate would have 122 electoral votes, almost half of the 270 votes necessary to win (Sources 1 and 3). "
7448	Voters for the electoral college say that people in the swing states are going to pay closer attention to the campaign and become more thoughtful voters (Source 3),  
7449	but should 10% of the nation decide who runs your country?! 
7450	The second virus causing the electoral college to convulse and bite its tongue in half is what happens in the event of a tie. 
7451	And finally, the last thing that makes the electoral college as relevant as a new wheel for your horse and buggy is that, it's mind-bogglingly confusing. 
7452	The electoral college is run by humans, so we must account for human error. The electors are just people chosen by the candidate who don't hold a seat in government (Sources 1 and 2). In 1960, a group of racists in Louisiana almost replaced Democratic electors with ones who would oppose John F. Kennedy, and he would have lost the election (Source 2). In Hawaii, also in 1960, two slates of electors were sent (Source 3). Faithless electors have refused to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for anyone else (Source 2). 
7453	In conclusion, the electoral college is literally pointless. It's unfair and confusing. If America had decided on a majority rules electoral system, and not this pile of trash, we would still have all the same presidents we did before. Well, except Al Gore.    
7454	I am strongly in favor of keeping the Electoral College 
7455	The Electoral College is a fool-proof way of not disputing the outcome of who gets to be in it. 
7456	It avoids problems by the canidates not recieving majority of the votes cast in the election. 
7457	There aren't many of them but i believe that they are needed to keep the College going and allowing it to vote the right way instead of the wrong way. 
7458	First of these reasons, there are more problems with popular votes than electoral vote and have a fool-proof way of keeping disputes in the low. The Electoral College is less susceptible to problems if the poular votes are used to elect the college. 
7459	Secondly, Having an Electoral College avoids run-off elections, where the problem is cause by each canidate that is running to not get any of the majority of the votes. 
7460	"To put it in more simple terms, In some cases there have been ties by the popular vote, or very close ties. In The same article as mentioned in the above paragraph provided the example of one time that this has happened. "" Nixon and Clinton both had a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, while winning a majority of the Electoral College."" The Electoral Colege breaks the tie in the poular votes because they reduce the pressure of having run-off elections. The states have a ""winner-take-all"" system, so that when the elections come, the president of those who are voting for him in the electoral college get to be with that president. The larger states recieve more attention from the canidates, so the popular vote getting tied up also does not happen very often.  "
7461	Last but not least, it is incredibly important to know how the Electoral College works because if you do not, then you will not know how effective of a sytem it is. 
7462	"In  What is the Electoral College?  it states that, ""The Electoral College consists of 538 electors. A majority of 270 electoral votes is required to elect the president."" The popular vote can get tied up pretty easily, but it is a lot harder for the electoral votes to get tied up because only 270 votes are needed to elect the president. "
7463	"In what's wrong with the electoral college, is saying that ""The most worrying prosepct is the tie in the electoral college....in that case the elction would be thrown to the H.O.R., where state delegations vote on the president."" If this ever does happen, MAny people in the senate or house of representatives would have to vote and would have to rake on responsibilty of the as many as 500,00 voters. "
7464	As you know, it is important to keep the best desicions of your country in mind , while thinking about your citizens that you are representing. The electoral college answers the questions of having disputes and arguments over who becomes preseident. It is an efficient way of keeping a fool-proof outcome and avoid run-off elections. 
7465	There's a few reasons for retainig the Electoral College despite its lack of democratic pedigree: the first one is that a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible 
7466	It is every student's dream to be able to lounge around at home, and complete school from the comforts of their own beds. Though, for some students, this long desired fantasy is becoming a reality. With the introduction of new and innovative technologies into the classroom, distance learning is now a common practice, whether it be online or through video conferencing. However, to pretend that this is a solution to the ever-growing problems within the education system, is willfully ignorant 
7467	Distance education is actually detrimental to the students who choose to take these courses, due to the lack of typical classroom structure. 
7468	Everybody knows somebody like this in their lives; a homebody, someone who prefers staying home over going out, maybe doesn't have too many friends or has trouble forging bonds and building relationships. You may also call these people recluses, or shut-ins, but either way, you've stumbled across someone who fits this mold. Favorite characters even, like Oscar the Grouch or Angela from The Office, can be used as lovable examples. However, these traits are not always so endearing in a young child. 
7469	But, they would then forfeit the opportunity to build relationships with other kids of their own age. Especially with younger kids and kids who like to stay at home or be alone, learning and building social skills starts at school. 
7470	If these children have the option to conduct their learning from home, they will miss out on important interactions with classmates, and also fall behind from a social development standpoint. And not knowing or understanding social cues or the proper way to communicate with someone, will prove a major hindrance to these kids in later years. 
7471	Having a friend who is online-schooled, who admits frequently that he has ample free time, which he wastes on playing video games and watching TV, while at the same time, students in the classroom are made to do tedious book-work, is very eye-opening to a pressing issue. Students who take classes online have more time to slack off and goof around, and for the less-disciplined child, this will reflect negatively in their grades 
7472	This is a valid observation. But without the constant droning of a teacher to be on task, kids who are distantly educated are more likely to become distracted and it's displayed in their meager and unsatisfactory work. Distractions don't cease to exist in a classroom setting, but they are heavily reduced compared to when a student is at home. 
7473	It's easily understandable that for some students, distance learning is simply the only viable option. Whether they physically cannot make it to the school building, or because their school merely doesn't offer the classes they wish to take, sometimes students are more or less forced to take online classes. And this is completely acceptable and understandable, and no one should fault these students for desiring an education and seeking out alternative options 
7474	"However, these circumstances aren't always applicable to the students who choose distance learning. And those students, who have no other reason other than they ""just want to stay home"" or ""don't feel like it"", should have to sit in a classroom with the rest of their peers, and learn like in the same setting and environment that everyone else does. For lazy students, distance education is not a valuable resource, and abused in order to waste time. "
7475	Distance education will most likely always be a hotly debated topic, in which both sides of the argument will raise many deeply introspective and thought-provoking questions and points. In some cases, distance education is necessary and important. However, it cannot be ignored that distance learning is not conducive or beneficial to most students. The lack of a normal classroom set-up, with teachers and classmates replaced for a laptop and a of couple blankets, fails to help students develop vital social and communication skills, while simultaneously aiding in the slacking off and wasting time of many students. All in all, distance learning and education isn't an appropriate replacement for a normal education that is received in a classroom, at a desk.  
7476	In life all of us suffer many trials and obstacles of different extremes. As humans a normal way to deal with these trials is to look to someone for comfort and advice. Whether that may be many people or just one person it is usually someone we confide in with our thoughts and someone that can confide in us to be able to tell the truth. At times, we may find it better to talk to more than one person when asking for advice. We may go to one person to get an outside opinion on the situation. By getting this outside opinion this person may not necessarily be biased to one side of the story and it gives this person a chance to be truthful. You may also go to someone who has a different way of thinking as you, someone with a different mindset. This person could bring up new points to you and new sides of the situation to open up your mind to new possibilities. There might also be someone who has a similar way of thinking as you that could help you reassure and understand your thoughts and emotions. Another reason why you may go to a different person is just to vent. By simply telling this person everything thats going on it could help you organize thoughts in your own head. You may not look for this person for advice but someone to be there to listen to you while you figure out how you want to move forward in the situation. By expressing your feelings to this one person it could help you organize and address thoughts in your own head. 
7477	it could help you explore different mindsets, 
7478	get an outside unbiased opinion, 
7479	give you a chance to express and organize your thoughts and emotions.  
7480	Talking to someone to get an outside opinion could help because this person doesn't know all parts of the story or maybe doesn't know everybody involved personally. This is helpful because they have no sense of bias on who is involved and what is happening in the situation. This person isn't going to sugar coat their words and tell you the truth even if it's something that you don't want to hear. They may simply listen to what you have to say and will already be ready to introduce to you new opinions and will help you look at it from a different perspective. They may tell us the truth to address the things we may be avoiding in the situation such as something that is right or wrong. This helps us because sometimes we need to hear the truth to see why we are right or wrong in these situations. By hearing the truth and possibly getting advice to move forward you get to move forward with all your facts laid out. 
7481	By talking to someone who has an opposing mindset as yours they will be able to give you new perspectives and new ways at looking at the situation. It may not always be a positive mindset but it's good to look at the negatives just as much as the positives. This persons different way of thinking and looking at things may introduce new and different ideas on how you should move forward and how you should address the situation. You may also seek someone who has a similar way of thinking as you. Theres always a possibility of this person help you discover new thoughts and information but this person will also assure you about the thoughts youre already having and make you feel better about them. They will give you this sense of reassurance it will help you move forward confidently and effectively. 
7482	This person will listen to everything you have to say and will just let you vent all your emotions and that may be the only advice they give you to just vent. This person will not only listen but support you on your choices and on what you have to say no matter what. 
7483	by seeking more than one person for advice it helps you get the support you need to make new and smart choices. 
7484	Different people that are helpful to seek advice from is someone who is more of an outside opinion because they tell you the truth and dont sugar coat their thoughts. If you seek someone who has a different mindset they will introduce new ways of thinking and different approaches you could take in the situation.  By expressing all your feelings, thoughts, and emotions you are letting someone know how you feel and getting the support you need to move forward confidently. By talking to multiple people exploring new thoughts and mindsets, getting an unbiased opinion, and being able to express and organize your thoughts you are getting set up to make good choices rationally. I personally believe that when someone asks multiple people for advice it and seeking multiple opinions it helps them be able to make smart and rational choices while being confident with their choice and content with their thoughts and emotions.  
7485	Receiving advice from multiple people is not such a bad thing as it may seem. Receiving advice from multiple people is good 
7486	Getting more peoples' opinions can heavily impact your decision. Having more opinions means more choices you can choose. 
7487	This means that the more options you have, the easier it is to do the right thing. Others' opinions can stop you from doing the wrong thing. When they tell you their end it may impact you and stop you from doing something you wouldn't have wanted to do. Others' opinions can also show you what consequences there might be for your actions. They might tell you the possibilities of what might happen when you say that. People opinions can greatly impact what you do. 
7488	Another way getting multiple opinions helps is that is can teach you more about the topic. 
7489	If you know more about the topic its easier to do the right choice. When you know more its way easier to just do the right thing since you know a lot about the topic already. If you know more about the topic it also helps you give other people advice on the same topic. This can help because in the future, you can help people who were in need of advice just like you. There is always more room for improvement academically, physically, and mentally. Learning is never a bad thing and can always benefit you or others in some way. When you learn it is a good thing and will always be useful someday. 
7490	Having more points of view on a topic is always a good thing 
7491	When you have more points of view, you can see your topic from another persons eyes. Having more eyes can help you see if your decision is going to benefit you and others or not. Having a different point of view can also help you narrow down. Narrowing down your options can help you very much and make it easier to choose the right one. When you have more points of view, you can easily choose the right one with others help. Having more points of view can help people in various different ways. 
7492	Seeking multiple peoples' opinions can help influence the way you think and act in various ways. Others' opinions can be very helpful in the way they influence your decisions, teach you about the topic, and give you multiple different points of view. Receiving advice is a good thing because it can influence you in many different ways. 
7493	In the 21st century, technology seems to be incorporated in every aspect of life. People of all ages are beginning to rely on technology for everything from communication to transportation. Technology is being integrated more and more into the education system; changing the way students learn. In 2020, students receive and turn in homework online, read digitized textbooks, and even take tests over the internet. 
7494	It would be easy to assume the next advance would be taking whole courses on a computer from home, 
7495	Taking courses at home would fail to provide student's a space dedicated to learning, and would present too many distractions. 
7496	the lack of true human interaction would lead to confusion between students and educators 
7497	a real-life classroom environment is critical for long-term learning and a holistic education. 
7498	Taking classes at one's home would distract students physically and mentally, making it difficult for them to be totally immersed and invested in what they are learning. Even if it is unintentional, a student will rush through their coursework in order to move on to something else more interesting; like playing basketball, watching a movie, or even just eating lunch. In a traditional school setting, class schedules keep students and teachers alike focused on the task at hand. Similarly, it gives them a clear time to take much needed breaks. An environment dedicated to learning lets students know that, when they come to school, it is time to learn. This separation of work and play is much more productive than working at home. So much happens at home. People eat, sleep, hang out with friends and family, cuddle with pets, have good conversations and bad conversations; the list goes on and on. Trying to do work in an such a busy and dynamic environment makes it hard for a learner to dial their brain into the current task at hand. A school environment dedicated to learning makes it easier for a students brain to focus and function. 
7499	A lack on physical interaction between students and teachers would lead to a lack of true understanding on the part of the student. 
7500	Being able to ask questions to ones teacher as well a peers is necessary to fully understanding content. In math classes especially, clarification is critical in order to learn high level skills and ideas. Even if the online class involves video calls, technology could add another layer of confusion to the situation, while other students may not be able to benefit from hearing the question. This interaction between peers is also a very important part of true learning. In an English classes, group discussions help students share ideas and understand layers of books they may not have understood or thought of before, leading to a deeper understanding of texts. Overall, the online aspect of long-distance classes would complicate communication, leaving students confused. 
7501	Not only does going to physical school help students learn better, but it helps them practice skills that are necessary for life. 
7502	Asking for advice from someone isn't always easy, because most of the time people tend to worry about what a persons response to their situation would be. 
7503	by asking more than one person for their advice, it can be easier to make a decision. 
7504	it can help you view and understand multiple points of view, 
7505	help with specific situations you are in 
7506	it can help you in the future, after seeing how the advice works the first time. 
7507	When people ask for advice, I have noticed that it can be awkward, or even embarrassing. Some people may have specific people they go to for advice, such as a parent, sibling, close friend, teacher, and many more. But going to more than one can be even more beneficial. Personally, I think that asking people for advice can help you make a better choice, because the people you ask have most likely been in the same situation as you. 
7508	Considering others thoughts on a situation is important because it can show you how others handle a situation. Plus, you might change the way you think about things. For example, if you have a friend that is constantly being mean to you, your first thought may be to argue and fight with her. But, if you go to another few people, I'm sure they will most likely tell you that violence isn't the best option, and that you should stay calm and work things out verbally. When you think about and understand others points of view, it can hep you gain knowledge, plus if the advice dosen't work you will know not to use again. Everyone learns from their mistakes, just as well as they can learn from bad or non realistic advice. Even just a few people can change they way you would have handled a problem. 
7509	Plus, when you gain advice, you yourself may also be able to help people. From personal experience, I know that I have gained a lot of knowledge from other people telling me a few simple words. I have also been given bad advice for my current situation, but I have found it very helpful later in life. A lot of people don't refer back to old information, because they are so used to constantly gaining more. I think the reason for that is because of work and school, it;s human nature to constantly gain new information. By asking others for advice, you are not only helping yourself, but you are also helping the people that will come to you for advice in the future. Just few words can change the a persons life. 
7510	For example, if a kid is in an argument with his mom, he may ask his dad, siblings or friends what to do. After he uses that advice, he may think that he will never need it again. Even though he may never need that advice again, lets say the same thing happens, and he gets into another argument with his mom. Since the first time he used the advice and it worked, why not try it again? When you give people advice in the future, it can bring back memories of when you were younger. A lot of people goon to share that advice with their parents, siblings extended family, friends, future spouses, and even kids. Even though you probably don't realize it, a lot of people actually use past advice in the future, almost as if it is second nature. Now when someone asks you for advice, it is most likely something you heard a while ago, that you are now passing on to other people. 
7511	Overall, I personally think that considering, understanding and learning multiple points of view is very important. Personally, when I am stuck in a situation I try to ask more than one person for advice, because like I explained it can be very beneficial. Plus, it is very important to have options, and not be forced into a particular way to handle something. So the next time you need advice, hopefully you'll ask more than one person! 
7512	As in the physical world, inertia carries ideas onward. No idea exists languidly or singularly. No idea is a simple utterance or a glance, lost to the world the moment their intention is blurred. No- ideas are sparks, and what spark doesn't greedily take the thin air into its lungs to then watch itself bloom into a mighty flame? Being of this nature, human progress rushes on through the constrains of time, thrust forward by the gusts of wind at its back. A step is taken, and it falls forward two more steps. As of late, progress has become more akin to lightning than to any breed of animal, striking with the full speed and power of all past ideas. Indeed, as many thing have, educational systems around the world have been profoundly struck. New initiatives and programs are constantly being implemented to better suit the new world order, as defined by sudden bursts of new technology. One of these widely considered ideas is the using of the aforementioned technological advancements to facilitate learning. Online classes and education via live stream as well as their positive effects can already been seen in numerous school systems. Better at preparing them for their rapidly changing world, 
7513	virtual schooling and at-home education are a great good to education systems and should be implemented around the world 
7514	they help students become more disciplined 
7515	prepare them for college-style learning as well as real-world learning experiences.  
7516	In this time of lightening progress, discipline and patience are long forgotten virtues. Despite the increasing lack of these traits in the youth of today, the world continues to demand them. It's simple economics, the law of supply and demand- all one needs to do is simply increase the supply. A manageable way of doing this is to give students greater opportunity to learn for themselves, which, in essence, is online schooling. 
7517	Two years ago, entirely unprompted by my formal, in-building schooling, I decided to attempt to teach myself Japanese. Today, I look towards my future, seeing my first Japanese aptitude test successfully completed and an immersion trip to Japan embarked upon. Teaching myself Japanese based off of online resources has not only fueled my love of languages and urged me to begin new language adventures, such as studying Mandarin, Korean, and Ancient Greek, but has also convinced me of my ability to do whatever I have set my mind to in a way nothing else has. I have seen both my mind and confidence expand outward in new ways ever since I began my studies, and that has enriched my life in an incredibly impactful way. Similarly, online schooling and partial self-education could give countless students that same pride in their abilities and dedication to their studies that it gave me. When told that only one place will serve as their primary source of learning and then associating that place with the direct, critical judgment of others on their skills, students, ironically, don't learn much other than to doubt both themselves and the system that supposedly embodies study. If instead those same students were to be given the same information but driven to seek out more knowledge for themselves and schedule their everyday life around learning, life would become an enthralling adventure to prove one's worth to themselves and to investigate and marvel at the expansive body of knowledge surrounding one everywhere. 
7518	In addition to enriching their current lives, online education and the independence and initiative that comes with it prepares students much more thoroughly for higher learning experiences than any in-building experience could. 
7519	A fundamental tenet of college and pursuits beyond it is a philosophy that partial self-education inherently breeds- learning is not about being fed a prescribed diet of knowledge, but rather seeing depth in all the ornate structures that make up the world. Schools employ countless lackluster brands of methodology to try to better ready students for college, such as the SATs, AP classes, and general preparedness lectures, but what can really prepare one better than diving into the closest thing to the actual situation themselves? By introducing students to this kind of learning, online schooling, on the students' end, helps to both de-stress students about college and get them invested in their own education. Many claim to know complex answers concerning the root of today's educational crisis, but there really is one easy fix- make students care about what they're doing and feel comfortable with it, and more students will find success and contentment in adult life. Ironically, the education system's primary function (to ready students for college learning) can really only be accomplished well with online schooling, a method many systems have yet to apply.  
7520	While in-building schooling fails to do this by turning school, and by extension, learning, into a chore and cracking down on spoon-feeding students information which they spit back out and are then evaluated on, 
7521	online schooling opens students' eyes to the idea that knowledge is a living, breathing force that surrounds everything and, while incorporating elements of grading and standardization, shifts the focus more onto individual students testing their limits and discovering their abilities fro themselves. 
7522	The world is changing, and in our lifetime, we will watch it morph countless times right before our eyes. For the sake of knowledge, for the sake of confidence, for the sake of virtue, and for the sake of the younger generation, who, if we can evolve the system in time, will go into the future prepared and enthused, online schooling and at-home education must be implemented on a much wider scale. After all, who else but our children will keep the fire of progress burning? 
7523	With the years of technology advancement, Online and video classes have slowly become a popular alternative for those who prefer to not attend school in person. Many believe that those individuals that don't have a big enough income, or those who like learning in a sole person environment would benefit greatly from taking these classes, while others prefer to stick with the traditional way of learning which is sticking with regular traditional classes 
7524	Everyone has found themselves in that sticky situation where you just don't know what to do. There are so many problems running through your mind and so many ways to solve them. Your head is jumbled up, and you can't think straight anymore. You start stressing out and sweating and you just have absolutely no idea what do to!  In this scenario most people go to their friends and family for help. They ask as many people as they can to give them advice to help them make the best choice. 
7525	by exposing them to many different ways to interpret and solve problems 
7526	, helping them think about their choices thoroughly without getting stressed out or anxious, 
7527	opening their mind to all the possible choices and outcomes of the situation.  
7528	There are many people that have a hard time making decisions on their own. They go back and forth between all the choices that they could possibly make, and all it does is make them anxious. I know this from personal experience because I'm a very indecisive person, and making big decisions stress me out a lot. But when I have the opinions of multiple people to help me, it makes the decision process so much easier. They all tell me their input and what they would do, and it calms me down and helps me think through it clearer. 
7529	In conclusion, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice by exposing them to many different ways to interpret and solve problems, helping them think about their choices thoroughly without getting stressed out or anxious, and opening their mind to all the possible choices and outcomes of the situation. Doing this can also help people make decisions easier, and can help many people think clearer when making decisions. As a result, they will always figure out which choice is best for them.                    
7530	Schools all over the world are making education more accessible each and every year. Most schools have online websites where school based information is published, and schools have interactive classrooms where students may turn in their assignments. Although technological advancements are providing learning opportunities, these opportunities should not be exploited. Growing in popularity, school districts are accepting students to take stay-at-home online classes, and the schools provide them all the material online 
7531	Students will not benefit from attending online courses instead of normal classroom classes 
7532	due to less concentration 
7533	less peer involvement 
7534	and limited learning variety online. 
7535	Students achieve greater accomplishments when they are fully concentrated, not when they are laying distracted on their beds. 
7536	Although students commit to attending the online courses, the environment in which they study in sometimes is not a guaranteed adequate learning location. For example, if students have pets or younger siblings in their households; the students will not be fully engaged if the pet or sibling is entertaining the student. A school campus, a resourceful learning location, is a better and more useful learning place when being compared to someones home or comfort place. Another concentration concern would be the inability to interact through online classes. When students stop a fluent rhythm of learning, they zone out and find something to do that entertains them. This would unbalance the online class' pace with the student's pace. Once students are out of focus, the only ones not benefiting are the students who are not at school learning in the classroom. 
7537	With limited concentration and lack of focus in a non school environment, there is only one factor that hurts the student's learning ability more. This is the lack of student-on-student involvement 
7538	Without other students, the limit is set extremely low on the personal growth of the learner. When there is peer involvement, there is growth in the character and intelligence of the person. This kind of negative influence on students also adds to the very limited learning experience online. Most of the learning factors that make a well rounded student are not present. For example, the interaction between a teacher and a student will be blunt and simple instead of a face-to-face learning experience. Peer discussions are also limited because there might not be any time for an in depth discussion like there would be in a regular classroom. Peer involvement builds relationships that influence learning in a healthy environment. These normal student acts will be limited if the classes are based in online servers instead of the classroom. 
7539	Students will not benefit from online courses more than they will from attending the classroom. The lack of concentration and peer involvement show how limited a student's learning experience will be when taking online courses. The disturbance in the pace of the student when at home affects the overall results and accuracy of where the student is placed. 
7540	In today's world, we are able to say a generous amount of people are being educated around the world everyday thanks to all the technology advances and the develoment of more educated minds lately. Even though not all education systems are optimal, it is believed that education can change anyone's perspective and understanding of the world. Some schools in America have decided to take advantage of the tools we have today to give students the posibility of taking a class on a device with interactive videos and activities. There is people who disagree with this new way of giving education to students 
7541	As of myself, I am a current student in Generic_City in a public high school called Generic_School which offers these courses online to students at no cost during the school year and over the summer with a fee. A few years ago, during my freshmen year, there was a terrible car accident relating to a senior student back then; he ended up in the hospital for more than six months. This was very devastating for the family, friends and especially to his future because he was a football player and had a schoolarship waiting for him. However, his friends at school decided to help Generic_Name's parents by selling wristsbands and shirts with his favorite color, purple, to alleviate the hospital debt. When he was able to move again, one of the first thing he had in his priority list, besides recovery, was to start his learning as soon as possible so he contacted the school's principal to see if he could take advantage of our online classes so he could catch up on what he had missed in school 
7542	With a little adjusting and permission with the county, he was able to continue with is education and he was able to eventually graduate from high school and I think this is a fantastic example to show one of the biggest advantages of onlne teaching. 
7543	I have mentioned before, I am taking an online class. I decided to take this class for the following reasons: to experience online school and see if it was adequate for me and to get this class done this year so I could focus on more specific subjects my senior year in high school. I started the course through a platform called vision used by Generic_School, which is both an in-school class resource and a online class tool. As far as I have been experiencing this new learning format, I have found many advantages to it. The course i'm enrolled in is self-paced, meaning I can do my work when suggested or work ahead if I have the time, which I have had. This doesn't happen often to me because I always find myself stressed during school hours, not thinking of learning and working ahead, but thinking about the time I can get our of the school's campus and go home. This is something thousands of students in this school had felt or are feeling. I have made a research paper describing how decoration and lighting in a classroom affect significantly the learning process of anyone at any given time. This occurs because many schools, including mine, have pure white lights and walls which can induce anxiety, stress and overtime help mental health problems appear or worsen depending on the person 
7544	This prison-like design of most classrooms and the lack of natural light really affect my focus and performance in class. However, when I find myslef in the public library or at home I can focus for longer periods of time and get my work done fater and I actually understand what I'm reading and doing better. 
7545	One might believe that when students aren't in a classroom environment, they are simply just going to find a way to cheat the system and not actually do the work and tests assigned to them like a famous Youtube creator has told his fans 
7546	Mark, or as most people know him Markiplier, is a famous Youtuber who has over 10 million subscribers and specializes in gameplays and some acting skits. He has shared his story multiple times about how he almost graduated from his engeinering career in college based on a complex but effective way of cheating the university's online grading system, which brings up the example of the potential abuse of online lessons 
7547	I agree there is those who choose to do the wrong thing and try to cheat the system, but I have known many dedicated people who have taken online courses who always try to use the resources given to them to make the most out of their education. 
7548	This can be compared to a well known classic  Matilda, a movie about a little girl who has very high cognitive abilities, making her a child genius. She takes the public library as one of her primary resources for learning to read more books than any child of her age; however, Matilda was born into a family where intelligence and manners were not appreciated at all so she was shut down from her true mental capacities. If a child like her had these many resources, including an online system for lessons, she would've gone further with her learning in less time. She could have also done many courses herself to not be pushed aside by her family and made fun of for her desire to learn. 
7549	If we look back when children were working on farms and factories, we can see how much progress out society has made in the last couple decades since we open education to more and more people ever since. It is without a doubt we're lucky for this. This is why many see online classes as a good resource since it can help those who are in a hospital to keep up with their learning, the different envirnoments surrounding a student can make a difference and it can be a tool for students who want to achieve more than average. 
7550	Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. Working together to make decisions has helped not only push humanity through brick walls, but find a better way around them to avoid the disaster. The entire government of the United States of America is based on this belief of multiple opinions being the correct way to solve a problem 
7551	In all decisions, there are multiple paths to take, but another influence can help not only to choose the right path, but to find new one (if needed). 
7552	other people have had to make impossible decisions in a similar scenarios as the one the advice-seeker is gong through 
7553	People that have been on this planet earth longer have had many more experiences then younger folk, and have gained more knowledge in the ways of life. This is why God gave us our parents. Our wonderful parents are here to help guide us through life, they are here to help us become a better version of themselves. Most children know that they can always go to their parents for advice, and they feel safe and comfortable doing so, knowing that something good will come out of discussing the choice and what to do. Choices are also frequently discussed, thought through, then solved with peers. In middle school, most do not have to make any life-changing decisions, but sometimes it can feel like it. Our friends, classmates, and team-mates often are able to relate to what we are going through. We are all a similar age and level of maturity. 
7554	"Many people at my age are like the thirsty sprinting towards poisoned water. It is terrible for them, but they are so in need that they drink it anyway, hoping for a miracle. People tend to have knee-jerk reactions, sometimes leading in the wrong direction. This is caused by the frontal lobe, the part of the brain that is used in decision making and long-term planning, is not fully developed until age 25. This means that minors tend to turn to the ""gut reaction"" part of their brain for major and minor decisions, usually strongly influenced by what their friends are doing, just to fit in. This can lead them to make stupid decisions that they later will regret. Turning to other influences to help make a decision can help avoid these unfortunate dispositions. "
7555	some people can get so caught up in a decision that they forget that it is not just affecting themselves 
7556	Our minds have been hard-wired to protect ourselves first since the beginning of time. Decisions are like lights, our own minds can defy us and twist our vision to make them appear brighter or dimmer. They can blind us from everything else going on around it, and make it impossible to see anything else until we turn it off. For example, when I was playing in a championship game of a soccer tournament in sixth grade, some of my team-mates did not try and play their best because they were scalding hot. They did not realize that this choice would cause us too lose, they thought their laziness would have no impact, but in the end, with three of our players walking up and down the field, we had lost, and were ashamed. Every move we take in the game of life affects not only ourselves, but the world and the people around us. Outside input in a decision can help us to see clearly though the light. They can help us choose the right choice not only for ourselves, but for everyone else the decision influences as well. 
7557	As a student I have had to ask for advice often to be able to come up with an educated response.  When I need advice I found it helpful to go to ask multiple people for their opinions rather than just one. 
7558	I do this because asking more people gives you a variety of answers 
7559	people have varying opinions, 
7560	a multitude of view points because not every one thinks the same way, 
7561	a plethora of different experiences to go off of. 
7562	You get multiple different viewpoints because you should ask a variety of different people to get the most educated response. This can help you in finding your opinion because you can see both sides of the story and you make an educated decision from there. This way helps you more than just asking one person because if you only ask one person you only get part of the story rather than getting the whole thing. if you do that then you are unable to make and educated response. 
7563	This happens because everyone has a different variety of viewpoints, even if they are the same, they might see it a different way or have different facts backing it up. This helps you when you need advice, by letting you have the full view of the opinion and limiting the bias by using other people accounts to find the inconsistencies. When you do this it is much better than just having one opinion because that person might be biased towards one side and then by consequence your opinion will become biased. 
7564	It is good to have a variety in past experiences because they can help you make an educated decisions for the present but also for the future. When you chose what experiences to go for, you should choose ones that are close to your present experiences but also for the future experiences you will go through. You should also have some experiences from the other side to siphon through the bias of the other experiences. This will help you to make an educated decision for the present but also for the future. 
7565	When a person asks for advice it is most likely they're in a situation that is to confusing or difficult to the point where they don't know what the right solution or choice is. Making choices in life can be hard. Most times they'res never a right choice, but having different people to talk to help you find the best decision. 
7566	Talking to different people and getting various perspectives in a confusing situation is helpful because it makes a person start thinking deeper because they all don't have the same opinion. Different points of view can be very helpful because of the different experiences the people could have 
7567	Overall, I believe talking to different people when asking for advice and getting various opinions can make a positive impact on the choice made because of the different points of view given by the people asked that could agree, disagree, or give you in site on the risks or benefits and the multiple options and solutions obtained. Also asking various people can help rule out the advice that wasn't meant to help you given by the people who don't actually want you to succeed or be happy. So I believe advice on choices, decisions, or on sensitive subjects should be thought through and decided carefully because regret it something someone wouldn't want to carry for the rest of their lives. 
7568	Education is one of the fundamental pillars of a successful democracy and harmonious society. As such, it is of the utmost importance that America's education system be of the highest quality in order to foster the development of intelligent citizens. With the rapid advancement of new technology has come opportunities for new ways to learn; students can type rather than hand write, access internet databases for information, and work collaboratively online rather than in person, among other advantages. It is easy to believe that all the aspects of technology that have been introduced to schools have positively impacted student performances, but an outlier is online learning. 
7569	In theory, being able to learn from the comfort of one's own home would benefit students greatly, but in practice, it gives way to lower academic achievement 
7570	It would be a lie to say that online learning does not have its benefits: it can cater to the needs of students who don't have the means or time to go to class full-time. 
7571	Research shows that there are three main types of learners: people who learn visually, audibly, and from experience and movement. At best, online learning caters to the former two, and at worst, it caters to none. 
7572	Classroom environments are successful because they are flexible in that teachers can alter their teaching styles to best suit the needs of their students. 
7573	Online classes or video conferences are far less effective because their curriculum is rigid. There is no teacher to allow social interaction and connection with students, but instead a computer with no mind, no heart, and no ability to judge student performance and change its techniques for teaching accordingly. Online learning takes away the opportunity for interaction and engagement in the learning process by making the curriculum seem repetitive and the assignments boring. Students of all three types of learning ability require stimulation from a teacher to remain engaged, but an online classroom setting is not the best way to engage students. They cannot, for example, stand and move in a certain way to demonstrate a concept, or have an in-person discussion. The ability to actively participate in education is vital, and online learning all but removes it. 
7574	The lack of a classroom setting or teacher can take away students' motivation to learn and can lead to habits that rely on cheating as a means of passing a class. 
7575	The lack of a teacher's presence removes the student's feeling of accountability and students often do not put in the effort to learn the class material. Online courses enable students to take tests and quizzes from home, but many cheat or plagiarize material from the internet rather than doing their work honestly. In fact, the issue had become so rampant that when students take an in-person end-of-semester exam in Generic_School, if they score significantly lower than they did on their at-home tests, they are believed to have been cheating the entire year and are required to resume the class in school rather than online. This goes to show that this is not an isolated issue; it is widespread and supremely damaging to students' grades, work ethic, and potentially even their academic transcripts. 
7576	Enabling the use of online classes detracts from students' learning experiences and academic success. A class taken online is one not fully engaged in by students. It is educators' responsibility, however, rather than students, to ensure that dishonest conduct does not take place and that students are engaged in their learning. The best way to ensure these things is to demand that learning take place in a school rather than through the internet.  
7577	Humans now live in a world where technology is accessed from all parts of the world. They are at a point where one does not need to be at the same place, or even country, to communicate. In some countries, a small number of businesses have even used technology to their advantage, and allow their workers to have the choice to work at home. However, when it comes to school, it is very different in the sense that students can be very limited when it comes to quality education and resources, which is important for a growing child. 
7578	there would be a lack of adult supervision 
7579	there won't be a hands on experience.  
7580	If students chose the option to attend classes online, then there would be no adult or teacher to supervise them at home, allowing the chance for students to not get work done and cheat 
7581	Without a teacher, students can be easily distracted and may use the computer for innapropiate reasons instead of school work; consequently, students would not get any work done or gain any knowledge from the lesson 
7582	Another reason why teacher supervision is crucial for students is because of false integrity. Some students are responsible with their work, and can be trusted to not cheat; however, not all teens are the same when it comes to free will. Since there is no teacher to watch them, these students have the chance to cheat if they wish, just because they would have the opportunity to do so. They would not benefit from cheating, so schools should prevent this by having all children present in the classroom. With no adult supervision, there is an open window for cheating and incomplete work. 
7583	Students benefit a lot from participation and a hands on environment in the classroom, but online, you don't get the same experience 
7584	At home, a student has limited resources and won't be able to receive support and feedback from teachers and classmates. If a student takes a class online, there won't be any teacher to tell him or her what and how to do the work. And so if a student is stuck on what they're supposed to do, or if they did something incorrectly, then they won't be have the chance for improvement or learn from their mistakes. Feedback is critical for a student's growth, and without a personal relationship with a teacher, there is no growth 
7585	Another reason why students need to be hands on and physically present in a classroom is because teachers create activities such as group projects, to make learning easier to understand. At home, a student won't be able to participate in class activities, making them not as socially or mentally compatible with peers. School not only teaches students textbook information, but it also teaches them how to work with other people, which is crucial when applying for a job or business. Without the chance to receive critical feedback and participate in the classroom, then students won't be able to improve or benefit.  
7586	They are wrong because parents aren't professionally trained, like teachers, to know what material their child needs to learn for one class, let alone seven classes. 
7587	It would take time for parents to be taught how to properly teach to their children, and even if they can, they may not have the time to. Further more, most parents work at the same time school is in session; parents should not be depended on to home school every day and every week. Even if a parent can stay at home, they would most likely have the more important matters of completing chores, such as cleaning and cooking, for the family. 
7588	Due to the lack of a teacher presence and of participation in a classroom, I believe that teens would not benefit from receiving education from home. Without a teacher, who has been trained for years, a student cannot focus on his or her work, and can fall behind other teens who are the same age. And without a personal experience in a classroom, students who take online classes won't be able to learn from mistakes or interact and gain feedback from teachers and peers. Schools were made to be a learning environment for children, so that they can get ready for life after school. But when you stay at home, you don't know how to be prepared. 
7589	Why is it more beneficial to seek multiple opinions when making a decision? When people ask for advice, they are usually conflicted about something, or don't know what to do. The reason that one person asks for advice could be because they don't know what shoes to wear, or it could be because they need advice about something bigger, like what house to buy. Either way, they are still seeking other people's opinions. When you are asking a person for advice, you want a definite answer. You could ask one person for advice about what shoes to wear, and they could say black, and then you could ask someone else for advice about the same thing, and they could say a different answer. 
7590	Seeking multiple people's opinion would be much more accurate and beneficial to you, because then you would have more than just one person's thoughts and opinions to base your decision off of. 
7591	You could ask one person for their advice on which outfit you should wear, and they would say one answer, and then you could ask for someone else's opinion on what outfit you should wear, and they could say a completely different answer. However, when you ask multiple people for their opinions, you are getting a much more accurate response. If you were to ask ten people for their advice on which outfit you should wear, and eight people said one outfit and two people said a different outfit, chances are you would wear the outfit that eight people chose. 
7592	Another example of how seeking multiple people's advice can help you make a better decision is If you were debating whether or not to end a friendship. You would most likely want your other friends advice on what to do. Chances are you would go to multiple different friends and ask them for advice on what to do. If you were to just ask for one of your friends opinions, it would be less accurate than asking for five of your friends opinions. Your one friend that you asked could be prejudice against your other friend, and give you a false, or bias, opinion. 
7593	when you are seeking advice, it is much more beneficial for you to seek multiple people's opinions instead of just one person's opinion. It is more accurate, beneficial, reliable, and shows you what the majority of people think. It also gives you a definite answer, instead of just one person's thoughts. It also stops you from making a bias, or prejudice, decision. It shows you what the majority of people think, and lets you hear from everyone. From seeking advice on something as small as what shoes to wear, or as big as what house to buy, you should always seek multiple people's opinion instead of just one person's.  
7594	Being sick is a natural part of life, and one of the downsides to this is you miss school and work that needs to be done, but if a student could attend class from home that wouldnt be a worry any more. If a student gets behind in classes that student can become stressed and break down and become even more behind. Being behind in classes can also cause drops in grades in the classes that student is behind in. If ones grades are bad then that individual can have a difficult time applying for colleges and being accepted into said colleges. 
7595	Not being at school can hurt your grades but also your work load, and if ones work load gets increasingly bigger then ones stress gets bigger. For example Generic_Name stayed home today because he was not feeling his best, but while he was away his history class announced a huge project thats worth seventy percent of that quarters grade and he missed the explanation. If Generic_Name knew about this he would not have stayed home that day, and Generic_Name's grade in history is not very good and doing good on the project will shoot his grade up. In addition Generic_Name doesnt have any friends he can really talk to about the project outside of school, causing him to panic and scramble to get information. Generic_Name is experiencing lots of stress as she was gone for two weeks vacationing and being sick. Her teachers demanded that she turn in all of the work that was given out turned in by at least the next two or three days. Generic_Name starts to struggle because she has lots to do and does not have the time to finish it all in such a small amount of time. Being able to attend class from home or anywhere could have saved her from all of this stress 
7596	Being able to attend class from home is a great way to help students remain caught up and to keep them from becoming too stressed out on amount of work.  
7597	If a students grades drop there can be consequences at home and at school, to prevent this a student can attend class online while he is away to make sure he doesnt miss anything important 
7598	Generic_Names grades dropped and his parents took away his gaming console and his phone to make sure he pulls his grades back up. Also he missed out on attending a class from home, for his school because he didnt have internet, and failed a test. his parents forced him to do online class to pull up his grades while on vacation in a couple of days. Generic_Name slowly pulled up his grades while away on vacation by using the online classes site to catch him up and got his gaming console back and his phone back. 
7599	While students are away they can miss out on valuable information and notes, and can be left behind with nothing to look back on. Generic_Name was out sick while his math class took notes but he used the classes from home site to stay tuned with his class and was able to take notes with the rest of the class even when he wasnt physically there. Since Generic_Name did that he didnt fall behind and stayed right with his classmates and when he returned he knew exactly what to do and had all the notes to help him with his classwork. Also Generic_Name took time to do further research on his computer on the subject and got more information and scored the highest in his class. Attending classes from home can be a waist of valuable time and can keep people from doing what they want to do 
7600	Being proactive can also help in wanting to improve grades and then that person will attend classes at home while away to stay informed about any up and coming events/tests.  
7601	Classes from home can be the better way to go, as they keeps students caught up on the work the class is doing while one is away, it can keep a students grades from dropping too much, and can keep students informed about class while they are away. The class still goes on even when students are away so when a student has a resource like attending classes from home can be better then even going to class in the first place. The classes can become harder but you have more freedom and your own time. Attending class from home is the best way to go when something is keeping you out of the real classroom. 
7602	School is the last place a student wants to be in when they've experienced a couple of rough days or even weeks and home is the first place they think about when they need comfort or rest. Similarly, not all students are carbon copies. Different students require different paces regarding social life and acdemics. So why would schools reject the needs of their variety of students? 
7603	Students should have access to long distance learning where they will attend classes online and where they will study in a safe, familiar environment that they already perform better in as place they can focus. 
7604	Firstly, the internet and modern technology's first purpose is to make our lives better. 
7605	"This is the direction the todays world is headed. Teachers loath the phrase ""I forgot it at home."" But with the ease of online classes, students will not be able to use the same excuses. Teachers also will not have to worry about misplaced papers when all of the materials will be conveniently saved online. "
7606	But why would a student take advantage of the World Wide Web at home when they have all the time in the world to complete their assignments and where they already perform better on their homework? Stooping grades will become the first wake up call for students taking advantage of the ease of modern technology. 
7607	Secondly, in favor of many parents and guardians, home is not only more comfortable for students, it is also much safer. 
7608	Avoiding more traumatizing events of physical and verbal bullying on school grounds will significantly increase the child's chances of performing at their best in acedemic as well as extracurricular activities. Even with some efforts to erradicate the event of school shootings with metal detectors and other techniques, students are utimately safer at home rather than on the schools vulnerable campus. 
7609	However, being at home more often will instinctively encourage students to venture out of their familiar environmnt and seek beneficial relationships with other students. The group video conferences that will be provided by online programs will give students the tools they need to interact with their teachers and have meaningful discussions about their acdemics and improvment. 
7610	Similarly, some students choose not to interact with their teachers they see on a daily basis at school on a more meaningful level where they should be developing better relationships with them. 
7611	Email, video conferences, and other ways of communicating from home will provide this for students at home. Instead of constantly seeing them in school hallways and in class, the student can choose how they will develop their relationships with and get to know their teachers. 
7612	Overall, students should have access to a path of learning that is catered to them. This path should accomadate for teachers and learners ease, saftey, and the students social needs. Home is the best place for a student to learn away from the school campus especially when point-blank bullying and mass schootings are taken into consideration. However, the students social life will not be diminished in anyway with the aid of group video conferences. The students online acedemic career will reflect how they learn best.  
7613	Lots of people go through life based upon their own opinions, but truthfully, having multiple peoples' opinion leads to making better choices.  If you try and make an important decision based off of only your own opinion, you could face a truckload of consequences. 
7614	Going to friends, family, or someone else you trust for advice is a great way to have more input while facing a decision.  These people could have a different point of view on the matter, have more experience on the topic, or they've made mistakes and can help you learn from them. 
7615	If someone has a different opinion or reasoning on a topic, they could help you to look at the issue from their point of view, which might change your mind on the matter.  Being able to look at a problem from both sides of the argument could positively affect your decision, whether it's choosing a side or settling on a compromise.  For example, if you're not sure you should tryout for a team, or be involved in a school play, ask for opinions from your parents and friends to see what they think you should do.  Their input would not only help you make a decision, but also build your confidence in what you're trying to achieve.  Getting multiple opinions on an issue would really help to make better choices on the topic. 
7616	They've gone through the process, or possess a lot of knowledge on the topic, that could help inform you on the best choice to make.  For instance, let's say you really want to buy a brand new surfboard, but you don't know which brands and models are the best.  You could go on a professional surfers' website and see what board he uses and/or recommends.  This would let you know that the surfboard is a top-notch board, considering someone who surfs for a living uses it.  Finding someone with lots of experience and getting their opinion is crucial in making an important decision. 
7617	Getting an opinion from a different point of view, receiving advice from a person with lots of experience, and creating opinions based on your own or others mistakes are all great ways to making better choices.  The person could change your mind on the topic, inform you with knowledge that you didn't possess before, or tell you what they did wrong and what not to do.  Whatever it is, talking with someone will help you choose, and feel more confident making a decision.  Seeking multiple opinions is the best way to help make a better choice.                              
7618	Sometimes you need to ask for advise from your peers or even from older people, like your parents or teachers.  This can be difficult as not everyone is very good at giving or asking for advise.  Often times, some people might give bad advise, on purpose or not.  Also, naturally, people are prone to bias 
7619	Asking multiple people for opinions can help get down to certain details that you would like to obtain. 
7620	Whether people know it or not, sometimes they give bad advise.  
7621	People are very subjective to bias, it happens to all of us, whether we want it to or not.  
7622	Seeking multiple opinions can help you make a better choice by getting down to specific details.  
7623	Multiple people will give multiple parts of the story and then you can piece them together to get a whole.  Having more detail will help you form a stronger opinion based on the opinions that your advisers gave you.  It is hard to get a lot of details from just one person, but the more people, the better.  In certain situations, you may not have been advised on, but having more detail will help you figure it out.  
7624	All of these will help you form a more secure, well-rounded opinion.  Even still, there is no right or wrong answer to life or how to live it.  However, asking for multiple opinions can, and most likely will, help you form your own opinion on life and how to deal with things.  This happens by removing bias, getting down to details, and asking from multiple sides of the story, young and old.  We have to ask for advise often, and getting multiple opinions is a great addition to that, that is almost always necessary.   
7625	Getting advice is crucial to success. No matter where you are from or what your future holds, asking for advice stays the same. Advice has many interpretations but to me advice is, asking someone their opinion on how you should do something. This could mean how a person should run a new business or what type of dog food they could buy. One reason I believe advice is so important is because whether you use the advice or not, you still gain knowledge and understanding of that person's point of view. Advice, as important as it is, should not be taken lightly (even for dog food). 
7626	Taking multiple opinions increases your chance of success 
7627	it explores different point of views, 
7628	eliminates biases 
7629	applies different experiences.  
7630	Every person has ideals and every persons ideals are different. This is important because with every person's ideals comes a different opinion which effects the advice they give you. Combining the multitude of advice you get with every person you ask will compile a grand list of choices, which is great for you. Now your job is to find the advice that fits you best and execute. 
7631	Opinions are everything when seeking advice and exploring different views is one of the most solid ways to make the right decision. 
7632	Bias is a trait of every human being. When given the choice most people would rather go to their family or a close friend for advice rather than a co-worker they hardly know. Although most people would stick to those that are close to them for advice, I believe going to new people could bode shockingly well. Sticking to biases will lower your range of differentiating ideals, which I mentioned earlier, in turn ending up with similar advice which is not beneficial to someone who really wants the best advice possible. 
7633	In some cases talking to a loved one is all you need but new people could add a fresh opinion that could change your course of action for the better. 
7634	Everyone is different and has had different experiences. These experiences change us and are the very thing that form friendship, ideals and views. 
7635	the most important thing when trying to seek advice is to consider different experiences. 
7636	This complied understanding from different ideals, new people and diverse people will give you a great advantage when seeking advice. Once you have this information you must find the advice that best applies to you and you situation. Taking to bias into account make the decision, whether it is life business opportunity or a new brand of dog food, being thorough with advice will always benefit you. Once you have your new advice you have gained more than just an idea on what to do, you have also gained new understanding of the people you have asked and a lot of information that will make a smarter person. 
7637	Good advice can be tricky to come by. Most people, when looking for an answer, tend to go to family or friends. Seeking out a trusted person in your life could be good, but only asking one person most likely won't help you to the extent you may be looking for. Not everyone is the same, and one person could give you advice that worked for them, but might not benefit you. 
7638	Asking multiple people gives you different viewpoints and options to think over. 
7639	What makes up good advice? Well advice in general is a piece of information or and opinion on a situation. You could be asking for help ranging from a moral issue to a fight with friends. Advice can be found everywhere, in quotes, poems, books, from your friends, family, teachers, or even strangers. Good advice usually comes from a known source, or someone you can trust. Everybody looks for a different type of advice, even if it doesn't work for you, it could still work for someone else. 
7640	Good advice is something that will help you fix a problem or help you see things differently than you have before. 
7641	When faced with a problem, many people ask for advice. Advice is one of those things that anyone can give, but not all are good at. If you have one friend who always gives good advice, you may gravitate towards them first, rather than someone who may not be as skilled. However, everybody has different experiences, and may be able to relate to your problem more than someone else. 
7642	Asking people who have been in your situation is a great way to hear what they did and weigh the options. 
7643	If someone is given two options, they will likely take less time thinking over the options and choosing between the two than they would if given multiple. 
7644	Having a variety of opinions and solutions may help you weigh out the good and bad. 
7645	Only having one option could keep you from seeing the bad parts of the plan because you have nothing else to compare it to. Though it may take longer, deciding which works best for you may be worth it in the end.  
7646	There are multiple ways to compare advice. First, make a pros and cons list. These are very simple to make and are a good way to see exactly what each bit of advice entails. Another good way is to just simply think through each scenario. Say to yourself, if I follow this advice, then what would happen. If any piece of advice leads to a bad or undesirable outcome, you may want to eliminate it and choose a different one. The last way to compare could be to think of the source. Did this advice come from someone reputable, or trustworthy, do they have experience in my situation, and would they possibly lie to protect me or to keep my feelings from being hurt? If the source turns out to be bad, then move onto your next option. 
7647	"Not all people like talking about their problems to many people. These people may decide on a solution, then simply to a sort of poll, to validate it. They may ask someone, should I do this, and weigh the amount of ""yes"" to the amount of ""no"" and decide whether or not it is good based off of that. Though this method works, you may be blind sided and not be able to see both parts of your solution. Rather than doing a yes or no poll, asking people for advice and instead, writing them down and grouping them together by what they mean is a better way to conduct a poll. If someone tells you yes or no, they aren't able to tell you exactly what they do or do not like about your idea. "
7648	Asking advice from multiple people could benefit you in many ways. You have more options, more sources, and more to think about. Even though not every bit of advice you get may work for you, it is important to hear different points of view. Just because you know someone and trust them, doesn't mean they always know what is best for you.  In the end, it is up to you to decide what you listen to. Choose the advice you take carefully, not all of it is there to help you. 
7649	Having different opinions can help an individual a lot, even though you may not realize it. Your way of life can come from your parent's, grandparent's, and even your own opinion. Therefore It is very good to listen to your peers, they might have information that you never even imagined to think about, they can improve your character without you even knowing. 
7650	Whether it comes to picking out an outfit, or watching the news, I like to have more than one opinion on what I should be wearing, or hearing on the news. 
7651	Especially in politics, I advise you to listen to more than one channel on the television to prevent bias. One station could be feeding you false information that will prevent you from knowing what is right. If you listen to two or more channels, you can piece them all together and learn something from it. For example you might have learned from an article that a local grocery store was selling horribly infected apples. Then you ask your parents and they say it was one apple with a worm in it. The article was over exaggerating just to make a big deal out of it and make money off of it. Different views can also help support you when it comes to applying for a college and job interviews, and when you have that job one day, you will want to know what to say, and when to say it. 
7652	When it comes to negotiating with a car dealer to attempt to get a new car, you will need to be prepared so you can both be happy. Communication is something in life you will use quite frequently, and I recommend attempting to master, because it can make someone's day in a heart beat if you use opinionated conversations the right way. You can even spark a pleasant conversation with your neighbor by asking them about football if they are big football fans, especially if you both like the same team. A specific opinion is needed here as well because you might have learned in the past that your neighbor does not like to talk about politics or the media, this is why you need to learn boundaries.  
7653	It is very easy to cross someone's boundaries and get in trouble in the blink of an eye. This could happen frequently if you only have one opinion from one source or person. 
7654	Nothing good will ever come out of having one opinion, or even no opinion. If someone has a missing leg and has crutches, do not ask them about it, that could be a sensitive time in their lives and they may not feel comfortable talking to you about it. If they bring it up, then have at it, you just have to be vigilant and smart with these types of things. Try to avoid boundary crossing as much as possible. 
7655	when it comes to communication and big events in your life, learning different opinions from different sources can be very useful in your life and should be used fluently in life. You never know if it will help you if you don't try. If you use this skill frequently, you don't know how many people you will make happy. The fact that it will help you make the right decisions, and make you successful, definitely would make me want to learn and adapt to different opinions. If you are prepared and know how to use this, the outcome of the deisions you make will be outstanding. 
7656	When you get stuck on something whether or not it is to buy a cat or buy a dog. You always ask someone their opinion right? If you don't, you really should it can help you make great decisions like, whether or not should you buy that cat or chose that job. 
7657	"Lets say you want to go on a cruise and you ask your friends and family their opinions about money wise, your friends most likely think its really cool, worth the money you can pay it off right. Your thinking, ""Yeah, this sounds like so much fun and its not that much I will work over time.""  On the other hand your parents are thinking maybe its not so worth it your already in college dept that you need to pay off why have another thing. So you think to your self, ""Maybe shes right this would be fun but I just really cant pay for it right now."" "
7658	This is why it is so important to ask multiple people opinions because they may be bias to the subject or don't want the best for you.  
7659	"Lets say you want to buy a dog, your first dog. You dont know much about taking care of dogs so you ask a few people their opinion on your choice, your family loves the choice even though they never had a dog. So you go to ask your friends they say, ""Yeah! You totally should do that, it would be so cute."" Now you go ask a experienced co-worker he says, "" Your dog can be one of the best things that happened in your life but you have to find the right moment, because if you work to much and cant take care of it its not worth it to you and your dog. Also it is a lot of money and time, you have to pay almost 100 dollars a month just to feed it on top of your time, taking it on walks in the morning, middle of the day, and at night. It just not might be fit for you right now."" So you take that into you pile of opinions, sure its fun and cute but maybe your not ready for it, its not fair to the dog. This is also another reason why you should ask multiple people their opinions "
7660	So you want to either go to the army or the navy and you need help with choosing, you love the land and the sea so thats not a problem. You go to ask your family they might be full ride or not they love you so they dont want you making a decision that could maybe cause you your life. Now, you ask your friends about it they say army because its cooler and you get to shoot guns. You realize they wern't much help so you ask a army man and a navy man, they tell you all the things you have to go through in training and in the real world, you think about all the posiblites and dangers for going into it you havent thought about when you asked your friends. 
7661	You realize sometimes asking people can change your life tremendly, it also can save your life, and change it forever 
7662	taking advice from people who lived for a long time can lead you into the right direction. 
7663	it can help you and your future family if you have one because you will have this advice you got growing up and you want to help your family. You'll be able to tell them all of this and hopefully lead them in the right direction. 
7664	Just to show you what I mean, I'm going to get into more detail. Not to long ago my family, best friend, and I went out to go eat at Subway and when we got back into the car there was a man behind with all gold teeth, as soon as I saw him I didn't trust him because of his teeth and I started making a fist. Reasons like this is why I'm always trying to get advice from different people, I've seen how screwed up our world is right know and I've had trouble trusting people in public, what my parents always tell me is to welcome everyone. I know I should be following what they have told because I've done that my whole life, that's the reason I try my best not to cuss, I will sometimes say words like that, but I still try my best not to 
7665	Like I said, getting advice from a lot of different people can help you get a different outlook in life, so try taking advice everyone once in a while 
7666	You can get advice from lots of different people, it can be good, or it can be bad. In elementary school I got into deep trouble because this guy was messing with someone else, I told him to stop, but he just started picking on me, but since I was in elementary school, he said something that caused me to break, so when he started to turn around, I picked up a rock and I chucked it at his back, luckily it missed, but I still got in trouble. The reason I did that was because my brother said if they hurt you, even with words, hit them back, that's some bad advice I followed. That's why I say right now, take advice that will lead you into the right direction, advice that won't cause any trouble, in middle school I'm surprised I haven't gone insane yet because there are some kids I want punch in the face because they mention race or call people names, but there is some advice I've been told that keeps me calm. One is these guys are my age, they can say what they want, but they are still my age, they can't do anything about it. Another is in the future I probably won't even see these guys, so once I tell myself that, I start to feel better and I show them that I could care less to what they are saying 
7667	In other words, if you get advice that can do good for you, that's advice that can stick with you, that could be advice that makes you a path and leads you into the right direction 
7668	if you have kids in the future you can can gather up everything that's been said to you, and you can save for later. 
7669	My mom always used to tell me about her grandmother. Once upon a time, there was a civil war that broke out in the country of Generic_City, and my grandmother died and my mom's dad left earlier to the United States. In the end it was just my mom, her siblings, and her grandmother. My mom would always tell the story that one day during the war, there were soldiers walking around and they happen to stumble upon my mom's grandma's house. My great grandmother opened the door, looked at the soldiers, and told them to come in. My great grandmother got up got them a glass of water and got some food and told them stories, and even though they had guns right there in their hands, they finished their food and water got up and left. My family has always been a family who has lived by the bible, to my family that's the greatest advice you can get, even me, so because of that story my mom always told me she has put her life on the bible and now she's a pastor of Generic_City United Methodist Church. I know I'm talking about a lot of Christianity, but because of Christianity, her faith went up, and she used the advice she was given, from her grandmother and the bible, and passed it down onto us. What I'm saying here is, with all the advice that has been given to you, you can use that advice and pass it down to your kids if you have any, then they could pass it on to their kids and it could keep on going throughout the generations. Advice can really go a long way if you get advice that sticks with you your entire life. 
7670	the fact how people told me advice really took me a long way, if I would've stuck the person who wasn't given any of this advice, my grades would suck real bad, I don't think I would even be I school right now, and I my life would've sucked, but just because I put my head up and listened to a lot of people, it made who I am today. I'm not saying go out and follow all of the advice you were given, I'm just saying consider it, if you think this is what you need, try get that piece of advice and keep it with you at all times. The advice I have been given is what I just explained, getting a different outlook in life, so that way I can trust people more, being able to get good advice and follow it to the point where I've accomplished what I need to, and lastly, take the advice I've been given and pass it on to everyone. Some of stuff in this prompt is really cheesy, but it's true. Advice can take you a long way. 
7671	As a social species, humans interact and mingle with each other, such as when one needs advice for a choice, one brings the question to another. 
7672	one can absorb information coming from different people and therefore different viewpoints, 
7673	one person could change the opinion of everyone else, 
7674	one can reach the decision of a choice by a majority of one's peers. 
7675	These reasons why seeking multiple opinions are helpful are seen everywhere and have a major impact on the world. It has been seen when Europe found how to fight a disease, when one man switched the opinion of a jury, and how a democracy functions. 
7676	"This is highly beneficial as one could hear advice that they would not have even thought of. Different answers derive from one's cultural background. One example would be medicine itself. In the 17th century, diseases ran rampant, especially smallpox, as there was no method of combating the virus. Europe had no cure for smallpox, and a large percent of Europe's population passed, as well as the American Indians later, who lost 50 to 90 percent of their population due to the disease. Many years of trying to find a cure for this disease failed, even when all of Europe was trying. However, a European came back from Asia (most likely China) with knowledge of inoculation. China and parts of Asia had suffered from the Bubonic Plague, and created inoculation, which today is known as vaccination. One received a small amount of the virus so one's immune system learned to fight it. This method of disease prevention was widely used in England, then in the rest of Europe. Because of the advice from another side of the world and the widespread use of this ""new cure,"" smallpox and other viral infections were eradicated from Europe. "
7677	The idea of asking multiple people for advice is prevalent today, and can decide the fate of others. An example would be a jury. A jury listens to a court case and then decides whether one is guilty, or not guilty. 
7678	Many countries around the world, such as the US, are a democracy. This means that the government is fueled by the opinions of the people, and value those thoughts. This version of government is functional as those countries are standing today. 
7679	When faced with a choice, it is better to listen to the opinions of others on the matter. This is as one can absorb knowledge from different viewpoints, one person could completely change the others' thoughts, and a majority vote could provide the decision that one needed. Past events that impact the whole world occur because the person that brings the change strove for these reasons why seeking multiple opinions allows for a better, more beneficial decision.  
7680	Think back to the last time you attended school and how tedious it was progressing through each day. Chances are you quickly grew tired of the monotonous cycle every week, and would prefer to have an easier and more efficient way to learn. Luckily, students have no need to worry over this with the recent introduction of a new learning method, and that is through online or video conferencing. This outstanding idea has allowed an immense amount of people to learn even though the numerous amount of obstacles facing their way, be it poor health or even just being away from school for a definite period of time. With this new way of processing the knowledge one would normally learn in a school environment, it has proved itself to be a great alternative to the normal learning process 
7681	students do indeed benefit from attending classes at home, since it allows for an efficient and easy method of learning the courses one would normally obtain all the while being in the comfort of a distant area such as their own home. 
7682	School is indeed an essential part in the development of one's mind and future. However, it's not the perfect solution for everybody, as some people produce a higher performance rate when it comes to learning at home through digital methods. A common reason would be the people who aren't as socially adept in comparison to the others, and encounter some difficulties learning in such a public area filled with a large amount of people. They would usually work better in a more secluded workplace such as their home. I can personally attest to this myself, as I've occasionally resorted to partaking in online conferences, as on occasions, I would have difficulty learning in an area with people I lacked the determination to interact with. This doesn't just only include social aspects though, as even people with poor health, like the common cold or even more detrimental illnesses, will find it very beneficial to learn through virtual means 
7683	Having the ability to partake in classes and obtaining the same knowledge as your peers while being in a different area as them, makes you feel like the illness never was there in the first place at all. This allows the users to learn at the same, or sometimes even faster pace than regular students in schools. 
7684	Online learning can also help people who just need to complete work that they would've have missed due to personal reasons, such as a family trip to another state 
7685	Normally, when they return back to school, the students would encounter a myriad of incomplete work that had accumulated over their course of inactivity. The pile of work would be required to be completed if they wanted to maintain their grades all the while having to simultaneously obtain the current information and tasks the teacher was distributing to the rest of their peers during that time. As you can see, this can prove to be physically and mentally taxing for one's mind. With the introduction of online learning, it allows for the students to be able to accomplish their work virtually, which allows them to keep up with their peers and have a smooth transition back into their school without the hassle of what I stated previously. 
7686	For starters, online courses allow for better understanding between one another, as methods such as video conferencing eliminates the background noises that makes it difficult to for the student to converse with the teacher and vice versa. If video conferencing isn't a preferred method of interaction, one can simply just type out their responses and inquiries they may have to the teacher, which makes it an efficient and clear way of understanding what they're trying to say.  
7687	On the other hand however, online courses are usually uniform with how they teach people, as they have clear and typed wording while also providing the users other forms of information sources to further develop their knowledge of the subject. This makes it easier for the viewers to follow and have a deeper understanding of the given concept, as they can simply backtrack onto the previous sections of the course without requiring the hassle of requesting the teacher to explain a concept again verbally, which often promotes tedious work ethics with teachers having to explain or rephrase the idea repeatedly until the class understands the idea before moving on. 
7688	Online education, although fairly recent, will bring forth a new wave of educational tactics and support for the students that will surely provide an immense amount of education support to multiple generations. Even through a myriad of obstacles, like their health or simply just finishing missed work, virtual courses will greatly help a wide pool of people with different types of problems to accomplish whatever they're trying to do with great success. Although there are still some who doubt the benefits the online courses provide to the users, I firmly believe that they will gradually realize how this will actually promote a clear and effective workplace 
7689	I think that students would not benefit from an at home learning system due to the fact that a face to face learning experience is much more efficient than one behind a screen.  
7690	There are lots of students that are home schooled, which does not allow them to have a real school like experience. For most of society, having the school experience taught them things, such as work ethic, time management, how to deal with people, and much more. If a student does online schooling through video calls and conferences, they are just like home schooled students, meaning they will not receive the benefit of having a school experience. For some, the school experience may not have been as pleasing as it was for others, but everyone has gone to a physical school got to make mistakes, learn from them, and apply it to their life later on 
7691	If a student goes to school through an online program, they will have not gotten to learn from the experience of being in a physical school, which could cause them incredible difficulties later on, such as the social aspect of life. 
7692	A big part of society is social interaction. It has been proved that humans need social interaction to live happily, and if they don't get that, it can have some very bad consequences. For some criminals, the government will put them into isolation as a form of punishment, meaning no interaction with other humans for a period of time. This is a form of punishment due to the fact that humans need the social aspect of life in order to mentally survive. Even though classes through video calls and conferences is nowhere near as bad as isolation is, they may not have many friends outside of their school unless it is because of a sports team or a community project they are involved in. Students who participate in public school are constantly interacting with their peers and teachers, asking questions, talking to friends in the hallways, and so much more. It is through school that so many students have formed close and solid friend groups, who go and hangout on a Friday or Saturday night. Those who do school online find it much harder to make close friends, and this is due to the fact that they are not around their peers all the time, which makes them have to put in a lot more work to find friends to hangout with. 
7693	Those who are able to form close social bonds with people through school is a reason why students benefit much more by physically going to school rather than an online video call or conference. 
7694	Another reason as to why physically attending school is significantly more beneficial than doing classes online is because of the interactive and hands on experience students receive 
7695	In classrooms, students get the chance to learn through interaction by participating in labs, presentations, class discussions, and many other interactive experiences. Students can use presentations and class discussions to bounce ideas off of each other, and if a student has a question after a lesson, they do not have to email or call the teacher back, they can simply go up and ask to get the information they need right away. There are lots of students who state that they learn better through visuals and hands on experiences. Those who take classes at home do not have the opportunity to have a real hands on learning experience, which for some could alter how much material their brain actually grasps on to. Students would not be able to physically pick apart the subject they are learning, especially in science areas, which could lead them to not obtain as much information as they could have with an interactive experience. 
7696	However, even though there is much evidence to backup why going to a classroom to learn is better, it can be stated that learning online through video calls is the way to go. If students have anxiety or are constantly stressed out, learning online may be a much more relaxing way to gain material. 
7697	i say this because not all friends give good advice and by asking a friend that doesnt give good advice you put yourself at risk of them giving you bad advice and it steers you into the wrong direction. 
7698	This happened to me and it put me into a situation i didn't want to be in. It all started when i asked one of my closest friends to help me out with a situation i was in with my best friend at the time, my best friend was mad at me for some unknown reason and i had no clue what to do she never responded to my texts and she wouldn't talk to me when i saw her in person. I was really worried considering she was my best friend and she meant everything to me. when i asked my close friend what to do she told me to just to ignore the problem until my best friend got over it, and i for some dumb reason listened to her. After a while my best friend got even more upset that i wasnt trying to resolve the situation and she called me and said that she never wants to be friends with me again, and that really hurt my feeling. But i couldn't help but think if i asked 2 more of my close friends i wouldn't have been in that situation and they would have told me to talk it over with my then best friend. 
7699	In the world of education, there have been many arguments about which way of learning could benefit the most people. Some agree that the system we have now is the pinnacle of what we can do to help younger generations learn. However, there is definitely more we could do so the next firemen or police officers in line don't make the same mistakes we have. One of these things is autonomy, the chance to build a new road for one's self. Who wouldn't love the true freedom to become anything by just working to improve skills? One of these bits of autonomy is the chance to try distance learning. 
7700	When compared to the much more prominent demographic, they are often looked over and left out. If, however, we put them in a more solitary environment, they most likely would excel in academic studies, due to it being less stressful for them. Just imagine people running all about, bumping into and pushing others, when they normally can't even go up to the staff to ask for help. Having the choice of distance learning could take away that stress, and open a whole new road for them to go. 
7701	Autonomy is a wonderful thing. It's nice to just relax and not feel like you have to go down a certain path. I do agree, though, that there needs to be some rules so people won't take advantage of everything. Distance learning is the very middle of those two extremes, understanding that one has the power to be anything they want as long as they work hard, while also knowing that there are still certain tasks they need to accomplish, and certain rules they need to abide by while doing said task. If we all let the small stars shine, they will shine brighter than any other. 
7702	When making an important choice, do people ever wonder if they should have asked more than that one person? Do they ever wonder if that one kid they asked had a biased opinion or if people in general have different opinions? 
7703	When making a big, important choice, people, especially young adults and teens, should seek more than one person's opinion. People could have different past experience with lots of things and might help people decide when making an important choice. People should seek more than one opinion when making an important choice 
7704	When making an important decision, lets say adopting a dog. People would want to ask multiple people if this would be a good idea or not. Adopting a dog is a big choice in someone's life and the person should seriously think this through. For example, lets say the person asks somebody who, in the past, had a dog who would always use the restroom in their house. That person probably would not recommend getting a dog. But then, if you ask a little kid who loves their dog very much and cuddles with it daily, they would recommend a dog. Now what if this individual had only asked the person with the bad dog? This person would now be denied their life time companion and emotional support. This exemplifies why people should ask multiple people before making an important choice. Now what if somebody wants to travel the world and they ask somebody about it. One person hated traveling, they were sick,got a bunch of stuff stolen from them,and got lost. This person hated traveling and would not recommend it to the person wanting to travel. This person had a bad past experience. But what if the person asked another person about traveling. This person absolutely loved traveling. They loved everything from the unique culture, to the flying in airplanes, to trying new things. This person had a good past experience with traveling and would recommend it to the person wanting to travel the world. 
7705	This is another example of why getting multiple opinions before doing something because they could have different past experience. People with different past experience will have different opinions on certain matters. 
7706	Imagine if a person is trying to open a farm, but the person's best friend hates all farmers. The best friend has a biased opinion towards farmers and hates all of them. When the person asks the best friend if they should start a farm, naturally the best friend will say no. But if the person asks someone who loves animals and the outdoors, that person would say they should open a farm. If the person had only asked the biased best friend who hates farms, they would now not have a job and place to live that they are happy with. This is one example of why people should ask multiple people before making an important choice because people have biased opinions. What if a girl wants to try out for a football team. All of her friends say that is gross and annoying because girls can not play football. This is a biased opinion about girls who play football. While all of the girl's teachers and family say that is a great idea and the change the school needs. If she would not have asked her teachers, she wouldn't be on the team. That is why you should ask multiple people before making an important choice like starting a farm or joining the football team. 
7707	People feel differently about lots of different things, whether they are small issues like shoes being ugly, or big issues like political opinions and whether schools should have dress code. What if someone wants to buy a Cadillac. Obviously, Cadillacs are expensive and the person would ask somebody before spending their hard earned money on a Cadillac. If the person asks their best friend who thinks they are ugly if they should get a Cadillac, they would obviously say no. The best friend has an opinion on Cadillacs. If the person had asked somebody who thinks Cadillacs are amazing, they would say to buy it. This is an example of why asking multiple people before making a choice is good because they might have different opinions. If someone wants to open a donut shop, but their uncle hates donuts. When they ask their uncle if they should open a donut shop, he will say no. He has an opinion of thinking donuts taste gross. But when they ask their sister who loves all desserts and will always support her sibling. She will say yes because she has an opinion of loving sweet foods and her siblings. This is an example of why people should ask more than one person before they do something. The student president might want to start a book club. A lot of students a do not like books because their teacher made them read a boring book three years ago and they have not liked books since then, they have an opinion on books from a long time ago. The teachers, on the other hand, love this idea because they think that students these days do not get enough reading time in and a book club would be a good idea. If the student president would not have asked the teachers if they liked the idea there would be no book club 
7708	This is why people should get multiple opinions before they do something because people have different opinions about things.  
7709	 When people ask for advice, they should always seek more than one opinion because the people they ask could have different past experience, be biased, or have different opinions about the matter. When asking for an opinion in something, always ask different people and different kinds of people. People can have different opinions about things and be biased. Asking biased people for an opinion on something is never good so that is why people ask more than one individual before they make an important choice. In conclusion, this is why people need to get multiple opinions before they make a big choice. 
7710	By asking of another's opinion, one can base their opinion off what they have heard, or know. 
7711	one can determine the best method for them self, or to check if something is valid. 
7712	if a student were to talk to a math teacher versus an civics teacher about which subject is most important for middle school, the math teacher would likely say math is the most important subject, while the civics teacher would say civics is most useful subject. If we looked from either one of the teachers perspective, we would easily identify on of the main causes of the biased.  The math teacher chose math as the most important middle school subject immediately, this is because they have spent more time studying and have learned more than what is necessary to graduate college, and have grown to love math. The civics teacher would do the same for civics because they have learned more than most others in civics and have grown more attached to the subject.  By listening to both teachers opinions, the student is a to better determine which subject they believe is more important in middle school. 
7713	if a patient is unsure if they need braces, and as a result they talk to multiple dentists. The patient can use all the information to determine which dentist is best for them by putting what all the dentists said together.  If Dr. One, says the patient needs braces for 6 months, but Dr. Two says the patient needs braces for a year and a half, the patient is likely to see a third dentist. Dr. Three says something completely different, that she needs no braces, with no evidence, so the patient knows the orthodontist is untrustworthy. However, Dr. Four confirms the patient will need braces for a year in a half so the patient knows both Dr. Two and Dr. Four are their best options because they agree.  By asking so many professionals whether the patient needs braces or not, the patient can ensure they get the best care for their teeth. 
7714	The method of asking many people for their advice helps people look at perspective and detect biased. By doing this, one can find the most helpful, accurate advice or answer possible. This helps one gain their own perspective and opinions based on what they have learned from others. 
7715	For the past few hundred years, school systems have consisted of one specific format, where students go to a place of learning and are taught by teachers. But now, with easier access to better technology, this school system is changing. Some schools are offering distance learning as an option to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. This new system has gained both positive and negative attention. 
7716	Although many say that distance learning encourages laziness and creates a communication barrier between students and others, distance learning is in fact beneficial to the student 
7717	for learning at home helps to block out the other distractions that come with school, making learning a more stress-free, focused, and effective process. 
7718	However, many argue that the student would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home, for distance learning would encourage laziness and create a communication barrier between students and others 
7719	But this is just the same concept as skipping class. A student has their own free will, and may choose whether they go to their class or not, or whether they attend their video conference to their class as well. Laziness is not encouraged by distance learning, but instead students have the choice to either attend their video conference or not, just as they have the choice to attend their class at a normal school as well: there is no major difference between these methods of skipping class. 
7720	It's exactly like a classroom setting, with the only difference being that the student isn't physically there. In the future, with even more and more technological advances, these virtual interactions will become even more effective. Distance learning would also help to block out the other distractions that come with school. 
7721	The main purpose of school has always been one goal: to educate the student and teach them how to learn. But inside schools many distractions are present. The social life of a student, whether that be talking to another student during class, or interactions in the hallway, has become a huge distraction to learning. However, with distance learning, these distractions would be eliminated. Of course, at-home learning will open up the possibility of home distractions, but the number of distractions will certainly be less than the number of distractions at school. With this removal of distractions, a new focus on learning is produced, one that is much more stress-free. 
7722	A more stress-free learning experience, due to the removal of school-related distractions, would make the process of learning much more effective for the student, fulfilling the main goal of schools: to educate the student and teach them how to learn 
7723	Stress due to school has become a major problem in our school systems. Students staying up until the early hours of the morning to do homework is an example. However, what students don't know, is that if the distractions of school are eliminated, by learning at home through online or video conference, they would be much more focused and would feel comparably less stressed as they go about their schoolwork. Being less stressed would make learning a more enjoyable, fulfilling experience, and would be much more effective for the student. 
7724	Learning at home helps to block out the other distractions that come with school, making learning a more stress-free, focused, and effective process. With the process of learning becoming more effective, students would be able to learn at unprecedented rates and would be ready to tackle the problems of our world. Because isn't that the whole point of education, and more specifically school? To educate the student and teach them how to learn, so that one day, when the students are making decisions that will not only impact themselves but the whole world, they will be ready and willing to take on these challenges. 
7725	"Many Public and private schools have advanced in many ways throughout the past decade. Schools all around the world have weaved technology advancements into the classroom and outside of the class room to help get students more actively involved in school related activities and lessons. Technology is a blessing and curse, which means it helps teachers teach but also in certain aspects it worsens the attention span of younger children. Diving deeper into this world-wide technology advancement that is happening, there is this one main question that gets asked quite a lot by administrators all around the world, ""Would students work harder and better if they could attend classes from home virtually online or through video conferencing?"" My full opinion to that is, no. Studies show that almost 97% of people work better in a room full of other peers, although the isolation and focus you may have at your own home is nice and relaxing, in order for a person to fully develop into a knowledgeable student they have to have, social skills, community awareness, and be able to understand eye-to-eye learning. You can truly only achieve these three skills if you attend school physically, not virtually "
7726	students would not benefit at all through at home learning than they would at school. 
7727	In order for all students to successfully climb up the social ladder, they need to have one major trait that can help all peers make connections, bonds, and even relationships, this skill is called social skills 
7728	There was a study done at Workman State College where scientist studied students who stayed home for the whole school day and then studied students who actually went to school for the whole day. Both groups of students were learning the same material, the group at home got a video of their teacher explaining everything exactly the same as what she taught in class. Half of students at home did not talk to a single person the whole day that they were at home, meanwhile, the students at school had many conversations with other peers and teachers. Throughout the day, the students who stayed at home lost 10% of there overall social communication skills and did worse on a pop quiz about the information that was being taught by their teacher. This study exemplifies that if you were to stay at home and miss even just one day of school you would miss out on many social lessons like peer project and even just normal conversations that are experiences that can strengthen you socially for the future. 
7729	While being at school you do not just learn about how to solve for 'x' in mathematics or who won the Mexican-American War, students subconsciously grow and learn more about their community throughout grade school. There is this whole other community aspect of learning going on that most do not even notice. 
7730	What is truly important about getting up in the morning and going to a gigantic building filled with hundreds of people is that it is filled with family, friends, neighbors, and even strangers. Meeting all of these people and learning new things about them can really strengthen the school-wide community connections. Advancements with technology also help us by letting students connect with other people in their community, but technology also doesnt help us if we are letting students attend classes online through video conferences. Doing so would cause a major lack of enthusiasm and relationships within a community. Going home independently and working on classwork without getting the chance to learn about your teacher or other classmates through this safe environment at school, causes a total downfall on community awareness. 
7731	Going to school everyday and seeing you teachers and classmates is a prime and simple example of eye-to-eye learning. Eye-to-eye learning is basically being with another person in real life, not over a screen, and actually talking and learning form them. 
7732	Almost every kid remembers at least one first day of school memory when they were little or even this past year. Well, that connection you made with other students and your teacher was an official eye-to-eye connection made. Unlike looking at a screen four hours on end while being taught, having the physical opportunity to talk to your teacher either in a whole class discussion or one-on-one is much more effective than an email or text message. There was a study done by the Freelance College in North Dakota, many certified scientist studied the difference between learning through videos on a screen at home or being at school learning through a teacher. Both groups were taught the same thing and took a ten question test on the lesson that the teacher had taught. The statistics showed that students who stayed at home had a test average of 75%, while students who went to school had a test average of 97% The students who worked on the computer at home had a shorter attention span because their teacher was physically not at their house teaching them, thus caused the at home students to do poorly on the test. Overall, this study clearly shows that students learn exceptionally better with eye-to-eye discussion in real life at school. Being able to communicate with a teacher one-on-one or in a class discussion really makes a positive change in the students academic performance. 
7733	Online learning is a controversial topic among traditional and modern educators. The rivalry between face to face classes and online classes is not necessary. Encouraging students to use their resources to learn in the best way for them is what is most important. All students have different learning abilities and strategies; some people struggle to abide by the strict school rules which takes away from their learning experience. Some may argue that learning through a computer cannot compete with traditional schooling, but there are significant benefits to both 
7734	Overall, providing online classes as an option for students opens the window to success. 
7735	It is obvious that almost every student has a different way of learning. Some people like to watch videos to grasp concepts. This is a resource that is not always available during school. While taking a course online, students have free range of the educational side of YouTube and the internet, which will benefit them. Other students need to write down a topic to comprehend it. This is a strategy that is available in school and during online classes, except while taking an online class, there is no rush to write something down as fast as you can to beat the bell. This can sometimes cause sloppiness and flaws. Many like to work in groups, while some prefer working alone. Group work is easier to achieve in regular school, but not impossible in an online class. Collaboration is prevalent in online classes as well. There is not one way to learn; likewise, there's not one way to teach 
7736	Online schooling provides options for students, which only betters the education system. 
7737	School systems have to make certain rules to keep their students safe, but sometimes the rules take away from learning. Online classes give students a chance to relieve themselves from the strict school rules, and focus on doing their best work. 
7738	For example, while most students are cooped up in the same building all day, a student who is taking a course at their house can choose to complete their work outside. Working outside will stimulate the brain and can improve the results of the assignment. Yet, this is not an option in most schools. Online classes open up this opportunity for improvement among work environment 
7739	Another benefit to working at home is the availability of resources. In school, phones are not permitted. Because cell phones are the most used part of technology by students, they may be a good tool to use during education. The ability to take notes on cell phones is a benefit that comes with online schooling. For some, the rules are necessary to focus and complete tasks while staying safe. For others, the harsh rules are a setback. Online classes provide students with a valid way out if the school environment does not work for them. 
7740	Many online courses require video chats or discussion boards between these students. This is still collaboration, even though it is not in person. It is necessary to collaborate with others in person and online. In this era, online communication is just as important and valid. 
7741	Furthermore, students must create a balance between in person learning and online learning. Everyone should try out different things to see what works best for them. Sticking with one way of living leads people to stay stagnant in their progress. Although some argue against online classes, they are a necessary option so people can have a plethora of experiences. 
7742	The differences in education are what makes it beautiful. Every person should be able to voice what works for them and what doesn't. Educators should support these differences and encourage students to improve, even if it requires a different school system. If school rules or strict bell schedules are holding a student back from their highest potential, there is no reason they should stay there. Online schooling is a way for students to explore themselves. It may seem odd to traditional educators, but if everyone is open to it, then more students are given the opportunity to learn. Offering online courses will strongly benefit the education experience for many people. 
7743	Do you ever find yourself asking for advice or opinions from other people? I know I certainly do, and so do most others I know. Sometimes, gathering a group of opinions can really help someone make a good choice for themselves, which can also help benefit others around them. 
7744	In this essay, I will be going over two reasons as to why talking to more than one person for advice can help you make a better choice, 
7745	The first reason I will be going over is how when you have more people giving you their opinions, the more you will notice one option has more people supporting it. 
7746	Setting up a poll on an Instagram story or Twitter is a prime example of this. Sometimes, you will see people posting a poll for what they should wear to an event. When that poll is over, you get to see which option got the most votes, and that can help you make your final decision. I have set up polls on Twitter many times trying to figure out what to draw, what music I should listen to, and of course, what color I should dye my hair next. These majority polls have really helped me make decisions in the past, and I will continue to use these polls. 
7747	This next reason is more for real life situations, and that is how other's opinions can help you see another side of a story. Sometimes, when someone makes us upset, we tend to lash out and act in ways that we normally wouldn't if we were calmer. After getting in arguments with friends or family members, people will often seek out other people's opinions to figure out what to do. While doing so, those people can also help you realize the other person's side. Me and my grandmother tend to get in arguments a lot where we completely ignore the other person's side of things because of how angry we are. She normally then talks to several members of our family, and I talk to my group of friends, who all offer up advice to help us smooth out the argument. Once the situation has been explained, our little groups calm us down, and then help us realize the other person's side of the argument 
7748	Seeing the other side of things can really help choose what piece of advice to go through with. 
7749	These are the reasons I believe that asking multiple people for advice can really help you make decisions. Choices in general are very hard to make, especially if you're an indecisive person like I am, so asking other people for help is something I do often. I've received plenty of good advice from when I've had issues with my family or other friends, and with the advice I was given, I was able to make the best choice I could. Even if someone else's opinion is unwanted at the time, later on you can really think about what that person said, and you can choose what to do. I believe that a lot of the good choices I've made in my life are all thanks to my friends, who help me out. Through them and others, I will continue to take advice and make the best choices. 
7750	Creating a way for students to attend classes from home is a very practical and useful innovation, and through it, many students will receive education that they might not otherwise get. 
7751	By implementing computer learning on in a widespread manner, students from all backgrounds and economic standpoints will be able to learn and succeed. 
7752	Students will also be able to stay up to date with schoolwork if an illness or other injury prevents them from going to school for long amounts of time. 
7753	Distance learning can also help those who are unable to access a school, such as rural families.  
7754	One of the leading arguments for the cause of widespread poverty in inner cities is poor education programs. In areas such as Generic_City, schools are understaffed and underfunded, leading to very high dropout rates. Families that can afford to, send their children to private schools, often costing thousands of dollars per year. 
7755	Distance learning could solve this problem. By creating a county wide virtual learning database, students can pursue their education without having to be in school. 
7756	libraries are available for those driven and determined to better themselves.  
7757	There are many cases in which an injury or illness precludes students from going to school. Both physical and mental health issues can result in the inability to attend traditional school. Distance learning could be a lifesaver for these students. 
7758	By giving them access to lessons, homework, and tests, they are able to stay up to date and current, even if being out of school for several months. Car accidents are a leading contributor to students having to stay home for long periods of time. Injuries to the spine or head can result in limited mobility or capabilities for extended amounts of time. Because of this, students often have to graduate later than planned, which can jeopardize college acceptance and scholarships. Through distance learning, students can stay engaged and up to date with classroom activities, and lessen the impact of missing school for extended amounts of time. 
7759	This is where distance learning plays a part. Through the use of computers to access video lessons, students can take classes on their own schedule and from their own homes. 
7760	Distance learning is an exciting and innovative form of learning that is being put into place around the world. Through the use of online lessons and videos, students who do not have access to traditional schools are given a chance to learn. Distance learning gives a voice to those who are often overlooked and forgotten, and gives them a way to better themselves and succeed. Though not without it's flaws, distance learning can be very beneficial to students taking classes from home.  
7761	Some people do not see the need to spend the effort in questioning multiple people to gather information and opinions, but it is a crucial step in research. They see it as only an extra step that can be skipped over without thought, but in reality, only seeking information from one person leads to incorrect, biased information 
7762	Though it takes time, seeking advice from multiple sources allows for more information and different viewpoints, leading to a better outcome. 
7763	Different people have different viewpoints and opinions. If you only seek advice from one person, you only see one side of what could happen, rather when you ask multiple sources, you're given a greater sense of what to do and how to go about it. 
7764	According to the New York Research Center for Populations and Society, on a societal level, nothing but basic morals are agreed on and considered to be universally accepted. What is accepted in the United States may not be considered normal in India, or the other way around. On a smaller scale, this may be less evident, but the research still applies to a great extent. If only one source is questioned, what they see as okay may not be seen the same way by another source. For this reason, it is hard for most people to switch societal views and morals. A study conducted by Generic_Name shows that when people are shown a different viewpoint, they tend to stick with it after being presented a new one later. When you do not get more than one perspective on a matter, you have the tendency to use whatever you were taught to make choices, and not accept changing to a more reliable choice.  
7765	you do not know the accuracy of the information gathered when only from one person 
7766	They may have learned the information incorrectly, which can lead to bad advice. As an example, lets say a new mother was seeking advice on how to raise their child safely. According to the Family and Consumer Science program, 68% of people under the age of 25 do not have antiquate information on how to perform childcare duties. If that mother were to ask one of her unqualified friends, she could be presented with false information. That friend may of thought they were qualified to give information. A second study performed by Generic_Name shows the less qualified people are, to more they tend to think they are qualified. That could mean you are getting advice from an unreliable source, and most likely your course of action will be worse. 
7767	"Bias can be hard to detect in many cases, especially when the thing biased to is smaller and less prevalent. Research done by the California Critical Thinking and Development Organization, 72% of people were unable to identify bias in articles. For what seems like such a simple skill, it is surprising in the amount of people who are unable to preform it. Taking to multiple sources makes bias easier to identify, because more conflict will occur in the information. One source may leave out information to angle the evidence, while the other states all the evidence. Even in cases where bias in unavoidable, taking to multiple sources may provide better results. As Generic_Name, a researcher for the University of Oklahoma states, ""Researching biased topics may prove challenging, but combining evidence together to rid the bias is a helpful strategy in reducing the nonfactual information."" "
7768	As all evidence suggests, taking advice from multiple people is the right course of action to receive the best information. When people only take advice from one person, they allow for many mistakes and mishaps. Next time you are trying to make a decision that will have the best outcome, rather than only asking for advice from one person, take advice from multiple and gather as much information about the topic as possible. The more information you have, the more likely you are to make the correct choice. 
7769	Many people seek several opinions for advice because it helps them piece together the ideas they get and create a better way of going about something 
7770	. It lets them see multiple ways of doing something while also allowing them to separate the good advice from the bad advice. This is why people get advice from the people they trust. The person seeking advice knows that they will put thought into the advice they give them. 
7771	Everyone thinks differently and has their own perspective on everything. This is why many people have very different ideas and opinions 
7772	Listening to another person's opinions can open your mind to the different ways of doing something. It can also help some people to grow as a person and be able to take their own advice.  In order to get the most well rounded advice a person must ask a variety of different people. Often times someone will only ask one person for advice, making their point of view limited. They are only getting one opinion, and aren't able to see how other people interpret what they want to know. 
7773	Unfortunately some people don't want to help and only want to focus on themselves. So they give a person poor advice in hopes that the person will stop asking. Then there are some people who are ignorant to the topic.  They don't know enough about the topic to give someone proper advice. Usually these types of people don't have malevolent intentions, they just don't know the right things to say. Asking many people helps to separate the good advice from the bad advice people give. It also can help to find the people in someone's life that care about their well being. Which, in the future, will help them make better decisions on later things, because they will know who gives the best advice. 
7774	If many people say to not do something then the person knows that majority of people agree it will only do them harm. It is the same for the things a person should do. If many people have the same advice then they know that it's the right thing to do. Indecisiveness is prevalent in many people. Having several voices present should enforce the person to make a decision. Someone can also put together all of the advice they get and find the common denominator of the advice. Making the person self assured about following the advice people gave, because so many of their peers thought the same way. You can tweak all of the advice to create a better idea or a stronger piece of advice. Usually your own advice is best for yourself, so adding other people's advice to your own can help you make a greater choice. 
7775	This is usually a good thing to do as there are many benefits to asking multiple people. Some people just go with what persons opinion is on something and don't even bother asking others what they think. This is a bad idea and there are many reasons why this is not a good idea. 
7776	One benefit of asking multiple people what their opinion is on an issue is that they can help you be sure of something. 
7777	For example, if you have a medical diagnosis but you what to be sure that you actual have what was diagnosed, you could ask for another doctors opinion just to be sure. This would majorly help in making sure that you have what was diagnosed. With multiple people's opinions there would be no doubt that the diagnosis was wrong or right. In the medical field doctors actually recommend you get multiple people's opinion just to be sure. They do this because they know that medical bills can be very expensive and they might be wrong.  
7778	Another reason why you should get multiple opinions on something is that it can help you find different ways to do something.  
7779	You could be having problems driving and want to know how to fix them. Normally most people would ask just one person on how to fix this problem. But if they ask multiple people on how to fix the problem then they could also know many other ways on how to fix it. This could help if the solution that one person gave didn't work or was hard to do. If you have multiple ways to fix your problem then at least one of them is bound to work. Some people might need to have multiple solutions if there was a medical problem as well. They could have some allergies and need an alternative medicine. If they went to multiple doctors to find the right medicine then they could have multiple options on how to treat their medical difficulties. Getting multiple opinions is good in this instinct because it means that you have many options on how to solve a problem that that you might have. 
7780	One other reason why getting multiple opinion is a good idea is because it can make you more educated on the situation that you have 
7781	If you are wanting to know how to make bread and you don't know how to or anything about it then you usually ask for someones help or advice on how to do it. If you get multiple people's advice then you will know a lot more about the problem than if you only asked one person. This helps in many fields including the medical field. For example if you have a medical problem but want to know more about it, You usually ask more than one person so that you know everything that you can about what you may have. 
7782	After a long and tiring day at school, students often look forward to returning home to retire in a stress-free environment. People's homes remind them that their strenuous day of work has come to an end and that they can now comfortably enjoy their home alongside the company of their family and friends. Students have come to have a negative perception of school as it exhausts their energy and causes them stress. But what happens when they choose to attend their institution from the comfort of their home? Does their home, a prior safe heaven from school, gain a more stressful connotation? School and home are two very important, but separate, institutions that students should not make the mistake of combining. 
7783	First, students will not benefit from attending online classes at home as they will get easily distracted. 
7784	Students are often young and their brains have the power to rapidly grasp and process information. However, this ability can be negatively affected especially when the student is in an environment that they are well acquainted with. A well known area where students have limited interactions can dull their curiosity and aspirations for learning, causing boredom. This boredom is able to take over a young student's malleable mind and replace curiosity with distraction. In a world where technology is ubiquitous and can bring the world to one's fingertips, students would much rather research the latest scores of a basketball game or catch up on celebrity gossip, than they would learn about the Pythagorean theorem. At home, a student's mind is able to roam around freely, especially without an instructor prohibiting such distractions. Making it less likely that students are being attentive to the subject being taught on an online forum that limits their participation in the class. Therefore, students will not benefit from attending online classes at home as they will get easily distracted by the comforts in their home. 
7785	Another reason students will not benefit from attending online classes at home is that they will be less motivated to learn. 
7786	Many students will agree that a commonly enjoyed perk of going to school is to meet and mingle with friends. However, when students study on an online forum at home, they do not get this opportunity to engage in conversations with peers as there are lesser chances to forge a personal bond with the students in the class. If learning online removes some of the greatest opportunities a student has to establish bonds and friendships, is it really worth it? Students need to know the faces and personalities of the people in their classes to gain a confident observation of each of their classmates' beliefs. Lighthearted conversations with one's peers are a key to developing relationships, and without the assistance of such relationships, students are likely to lack motivation in their goals and studies. Additionally, students will lack motivation in their coursework if they have less need to participate during lectures. An online study forum greatly hinders a student's ability to communicate with peers and take part in group discussions. These discussions are essential for a student's success in core classes as they captivate the student and make them play an active role in the class. Being an active learner provides students with the necessary skills to communicate with the professor and their peers, as well as to actively observe the essential components that are being discussed in the classroom's environment. The lack of opportunity to discuss topics with another student can create an uninteresting perception of that class and make students less inclined to partake in class activities and lectures. Therefore, students will not benefit from attending classes at home as they will be less motivated to partake in the class when their abilities to create relationships and be an active learner are hindered. 
7787	"In conclusion, students will not benefit from attending online classes at home as they will get easily distracted and be less motivated to learn. If students are to properly balance their home life and their studies, a more reasonable approach that doesn't compromise their relaxation or student life needs to be found. Also, students who attempt to take an online class at home are more likely to be distracted by the comforts that are at their reach. The inability to forge relationships and connect with peers is another drawback of taking an online class at home. Likewise, the lack of opportunities to partake in in-class discussions creates barriers for students to succeed as active learners. Nobel Peace Prize winner and educational activist Malala Yousafzai once said,""a paper and pen can change the world."" Yousafzai overcame many hindrances before she could provide education to the girls in her village, so why do we undermine its importance? Education is a powerful tool that we must use to guide the future, it is not something that we can compromise on for comfort. "
7788	The safest place on earth for anyone on earth is their home, you eat, sleep, and live in your home so why should you not learn there too? Schools used to be the traditional option for learning and education but with students becoming a danger to one another and teachers finding it difficult to deal with certain students its seems as though the system is falling apart. Home schooling is one of the options that many parents are choosing to use as an alternative and this is with good reason. Home schooling is more student-centered than public education and can groom a student differentlly depending on the program 
7789	by creating a safe learning environment 
7790	honing in on a students personal growth 
7791	using technological advancements to enhance their education. 
7792	Everyday more children are put in home education programs due to the many issues with the present school systems. Safety of the student always is most important in any learning environment and one of the safest places for a student is within the walls of their own home. External conflicts with other students is prevented because students will not be given the opportunity to interact with one another outside of hearing one or two of them ask a question. Since the student is at home they can eat or wrap themselves up in a blanket or sit in some comfortable clothes while learning to excercise the comfortability of learning at home 
7793	With the liberty and comfort of home also comes the ability to block out any distractions that could prevent students from learning to the best of their ability. 
7794	Students would rather talk to their peers than learn but when choosing to learn at home the student is making the executive decision to focus on his/her schoolwork therefore, they will control their surroundings and create a distraction free learning space for the most effective learning experience within their own home. Students can utilize the teachers in the way that school was originally intended without having to wait on a classmate to finish asking a teacher a question or wait till the teacher is finished helping the other students. Since students can learn from their own homes they can eat whenever they would like to and never have to really leave the classroom or stop for a lunch break. The liberty to customize a learning space allows the student to create a space that can be the most preferred and visually appealing to enhance overall brain activity and creativity. 
7795	With the elimination of a multitude of distractions found in public schools, students will find it easier to use the tools and technology given to them to aid their educational path. 
7796	Education like many things has had a traditional way of being however, like many things nowadays that tradition is prone to change and it is for the better. Technology is one of the most important and useful tools in todays society and schools are already utilizing it and it utilized even more so by home schoolers. Since the courses are essentially entirely online, teachers can use many online softwares to create fun, educational, and dynamic learning activities rather than simply assigning worksheets or textbook work. The online systems can help students with writing papers and with calculations in math all while explaining why things work the way that they do making the teacher's job even easier 
7797	Home schooling is the greater alternative to public schooling because of the ability to learn within a controlled environment that elimnates any and all distractions so that students can fully utilize their education. By eliminating the possibility of abuse or harm from other students and enabling a positive outlook on learning and wanting to learn home schooling proves that it is superior 
7798	Home schooling can be seen as the way of schooling that focuses more on the growth and learning of each individual rather than the large group known as a class. Home schooling is the greater option for students it keeps them safe, allows them to learn the way that they find comfortable, and it is focused around them to ensure that they learn what they need to prepare them for their career.         
7799	even if students go somewhere or get a emergancy they can still attends the classes online. 
7800	Eventhough students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home there is some students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they might not take it serious. 
7801	Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because even if the students go somewhere or they got a emergancy you can still attend the classes online. 
7802	In conclusion eventhough some say students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they might not take it serious, actually students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it is more relaxing and even if students go somewhere or get a emergancy they can still attends the classes online.  
7803	Imagine a world where instead of going to school, you could stay at home everyday and not face the burden of waking up early to make it to your first period class on time. Sounds like a fantasy, right? This could become a reality if you choose to participate in distance learning and take your classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. However, the question is whether or not this system would be efficient in educating students, and if students benefit from being able to attend classes from home. 
7804	Although distance learning may seem like a better alternative to many students, it's clearly ineffective in educating them properly. 
7805	Students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because there would be no face to face interactions with their instructors and peers 
7806	there would be no hands-on-learning within their class lessons, 
7807	students would not be able to become used to a college setting after participating in distance learning for a long time. 
7808	Interacting with people face to face is essential for maintaining not only a proper education, but mental health and social life as well. Interacting with teachers is crucial when students have trouble understanding a topic or lesson. 
7809	In a classroom environment, teachers can easily explain the questions that students may have through visual demonstration. Take for example, my math class at school; when I have trouble understanding a topic in math, I ask the teacher. She then proceeds to demonstrate an example on the Promethean board, showing all the work and further explaining other questions I have. In an online setting however, students would be restricted to communicating with their teachers through messaging or email. In that scenario, it would be hard for teachers to explain student's questions due to their inability to provide a visual demonstration. Also, students may be in the risk of experiencing loneliness due to the lack of social interaction. Students make most of their friends through school, and by having an online classroom with no face to face interactions, they're missing out on all the friends and memories they could've made. Maintaining a social life and friends is critical for the mental health of children and young adults, and distance learning would only be taking this away from them. Distance learning would not serve to be beneficial to students because of its inability to provide face to face interaction interaction with teachers and their peers. 
7810	Another way distance learning isn't beneficial to students is that it provides no hands-on-learning activities. 
7811	Hands-on-learning is an effective way of learning which makes lessons and concepts a lot more memorable. It's also necessary for science labs and projects. Last year in my AP Biology class, we frequently did labs, which helped me learn the material a lot better than the lectures did. An example would be when we dissected an embryo of a pig, in which I was able to gain a better understanding of anatomy and parts of the body. Group projects also widened my understanding of topics in other classes as well. When we had to use a three dimensional printer to copy the outline of a roman column, a type of architecture, I was able to better understand the designs and features involved in the creation of this type of structure. Online classes wouldn't be able to provide the same opportunity because it would be impossible to perform regulated science labs and complex projects in a household setting. Many students find hands-on-learning activities to be more compelling and memorable than lectures and notes. Due to the inability of distance learning to provide hands-on-learning, it's an ineffective form of education which won't serve as a benefit for students. 
7812	Aside from distance learning's lack of ability to provide face to face interactions and hands-on-learning, it also fails to allow students to experience an ideal college classroom setting. 
7813	A majority of high school students plan to pursue higher levels of study in the future and attend college. Universities often have classroom settings for their lectures, and students will not be used to it if they have been studying from home for their high school years. A classroom setting and a household setting are two completely different experiences. It would be difficult for someone to get used to a classroom setting after they've spent years without even stepping into a classroom. Another disadvantage is that they may find participating in group work to be difficult. Many college assignments involve projects or group work, and distance learning students would likely not be able to perform as well in those assignments than as students who attended regular school. For example, it may be hard for them to follow the directions and meet the requirements for the project, as well as being able to interact and make agreements with their group members. Furthermore, group work is also critical in jobs outside of college, so this applies to students not attending college as well. Distance learning students wouldn't be used to the ideal college or job setting and would have trouble getting used to it. Because of this, online education wouldn't benefit students as much as regular classrooms do.  
7814	Although the idea of not attending school and staying at home all day is a dream for many students, it fails to serve the same benefits to students that regular classrooms do. When comparing distance learning to classroom settings, it can be seen that learning in classrooms is a much more beneficial option. Students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because there would be no face to face interactions with their instructors and peers, there would be no hands-on-learning within their class lessons, and students would not be able to become used to a college setting after participating in distance learning for a long time. 
7815	Sometimes when asking for advice, people talk to more than one person because it is difficult to get proper reassurance with only one person's opinion 
7816	a person may favor somebody else's opinion, rather than the first person they asked, 
7817	sometimes, others simply lack honesty. 
7818	Many people like to see what others think about them, rather it be a new look, or needing guidance in a difficult situation. 
7819	"If somebody needs a quick response to their concern, they may ask a person near them, whether they deeply know the person, or don't know the person at all. Sometimes, in the moment, people need fast advice, although the advice may not necessarily be the best. This ""fast advice"" can make people feel better in the moment, but they still may not fully believe what the person had told them, especially if they don't have a connection with that person. This can cause the person seeking advice to ask other people what they think, just to be safe. If somebody asks other people the same question and gets a different response, they may value the second or third person's opinions, rather than the opinion coming from the first person they asked. For example, when going to get seen by a doctor for an injury, people may have multiple consultations for treatment, then choose which treatment plan best suits them. Therefore, having multiple valued opinions can help somebody make a decision that fits the situation, but also fits that person's own needs.  "
7820	Many people have been asked for their opinion, yet, they may not tell the truth. People have trouble telling the truth to people at times, simply because they worry that they may hurt that person's feelings. A lot of times, the thought process of the people that are lying is more along the lines of trying to be kind and respectful, rather than giving a fully honest opinion. Although some people might not tell the truth, others most likely will, if asked. Since honesty is a key component of trust, honesty is valued far more in rough situations, than just being nice. 
7821	If somebody asked only one person their opinion, it would be impossible to get a group's majority. As mentioned in the second paragraph, a majority of people can bring far more reassurance than one person. This can help somebody make better decisions, since there are other people that have examined the situation as their own, and have given thought out advice. As well, it is often a good feeling to somebody, knowing that multiple people acknowledge and care about them. People like when they have not been lied to, because it shows a relationship of trust. Trust can play a big factor, in terms of advice, because a person will not be able to believe other people's ideas, if they can't rely on the person. In conclusion, asking a group of people for advice can lead to different recommendations, an increased sense of relief, and ultimately, making better decisions. At the end of the day, it is important to ask others for advice because people have to make their own decisions. Sometimes it can be extremely hard for people to decide which path to take. 
7822	Therefore, seeking advice from multiple people is a better way of guidance, and can lead people to make more effective decisions.           
7823	Seeking advice from multiple people will give you a sense of what other people think about the topic. 
7824	Seeking answers from multiple people will give you more of an understanding about what is going on and what you should decide to do in order to produce a better outcome for you and for others. In order to make the right decision you need to be aware of how the majority of the people you ask view the topic. Asking questions about problems is how you become smarter. If nobody were to ask questions, nobody would be smart, and we would all still be living in caves. In order to gain knowledge we need to understand how things function in our world. We need to know what to do and what not to do. 
7825	There are many possible outcomes that could lead to bad things if you don't ask others' point of view on the topic. 
7826	For example, a classmate named Generic_Name and I are having problems between ourselves. I do not know whether to apologize or to let the freindship die off. I ask ten people in my class about their opinion on Generic_Name. Nine out of the ten people think that Generic_Name has a very self loathing and snippy personality. They also say that he often does not care about his friends and only does things that please himself.  Because I asked my fellow classmates, I now have a sense of Generic_Name's personality traits. The majority of my classmates did not like Generic_Name very much. Mrs. Generic_Name, my math teacher, often gets mad at Generic_Name and sends him home with misbehavior notes for his parents to read. I now know that Generic_Name is not a very nice person and is prone to getting into trouble. Based on what I have heard from others and what I have learned in class about Generic_Name, I have come to the conclusion that it would not be a wise decision to become friends with Generic_Name again. Becoming friends with Generic_Name would set me up for failure. I would fall under the influence of Generic_Name and most likely get myself into trouble. 
7827	Asking multiple people's opinions can also be a great stradegy for the work environment. 
7828	Getting advice from others at work can lead to multiple benefits. For example, I am working on a presentation for a new product, I ask my bosses whether or not they think it would be a good idea to implement a free fifty day trial. Eighty percent of my bosses deem it necessary to include a free fifty day trial. In the longrun, it would help push the customers to buy our product becuase they know they can always return it before the fifty days is up. As a result, on the day that the product was released to the public, we made thirty percent more sales than we had previously thought due to the fifty day free trial. That very same day my boss decided to give me a fifteen percent pay raise for my idea of implementing the fifty day free trial.  
7829	you will always arrive at the best decision if you ask multiple people's opinions. 
7830	"The best way to understand how the world works is to ask questions. Without questions we would still be living in caves with no electricity and wearing no clothes. ""Two heads are always better than one"", said the great Albert Einstein. Asking multiple opinions will produce a better outcome than just using you're knowledge on the subject. There is only one way to put this, it is a complete mistake for someone to go into something blind, you need to know your surroundings, it just so happens that the only way to avoid going into something blind, is asking people their opinions.                         "
7831	all of us need some advise at some point in our life. We ask for advise to get through rough times, bad situations, and even life itself. 
7832	I believe this type of technology is very useful and will be beneficial to children around the globe 
7833	The ability for children and teens to have online classes would be very beneficial because allows students to be at home, letting them have more time to act on their other interests. 
7834	At school students spend a lot of unneeded time either walking around or doing extra things that may be needed for their studies, outside of their main classes. When students have the ability to stay at home this offers a lot of this down time to be spent working on projects of their interest or improving on their abilities that they may have not been able to do at school. For example, a teen may be into programming computers and has all of the equipment needed at home. In between or after finishing school work, this student will be able to have the time to use his own computer to program, and lets this student work on this skill that he wishes to pursue in his later career. The student would have the opportunity to fulfill this unneeded time at school to do tasks he enjoys during the day. Another thing that takes up a lot of time is transportation to and from school for kids who live long distances away. With the ability to work from home, this long distance transportation is removed leading to more time for activities enjoyed by a student. For example, If a student was able to take away that 30 min to school and back, it allows that hour to be spent on an activity that the student might want to pursue. Due to these reasons it would be highly beneficial for a student to learn from home, due to the unneeded time being taken away and adding more free time for other tasks. 
7835	The student away from sicknesses that may be spread due to the mass amount of people in a school. Staying at home and learning keeps these students away from any harmful sicknesses that may be caught at school. This may be very helpful for people that are more prone to sickness or have weak immune systems because it keeps them from the danger of being seriously harmed. 
7836	The ability for these people to stay at home also causes them to be less distracted from the thoughts of getting sick and letting them stay focused on learning. 
7837	Due to the rise in school shootings around the country, this ability to learn online keeps these students and parents safe from this fear. Students staying at home, allows the distraction of an intruder coming into the school to be exterminated and once again lets them focus on learning. Being safer is one reason why online learning from home would be a better option to learn without the distraction of being in danger. 
7838	Although online learning would be a very beneficial to students, people who learn at home will lack some communication skills that would be needed later in life. 
7839	Students in school are forced to interact and learn how to communicate with one another while in school. Students who learn at home do not get the opportunity to see other people on a daily basis and learn things certain skills like how to talk to certain people and when to talk. This skill will be very important later when trying to apply for a job and working with fellow partners. So people who will learn from home will certainly be at a disadvantage when communicating with their co-workings due to the lack of practice. 
7840	To go along with talking to others, these online learners will not get the same high school experience of that of their peers. 
7841	Even though their are many benefits to having online schooling, not being able to associate with people from all walks of life is a major disadvantage to it. 
7842	Online schooling is a recent form of schooling which allows students to be at home and learn the same information as students at school. The use of online school is certainly going to increase in size as new ideas and thoughts begin to approach. Even though this online school may change the way the worlds schooling has been used throughout the years, it is a big step in technological advancement. Although there may be some affects to online schooling, I believe that it is beneficial for students to have online learning because it allows students the time to focus on activities they want to use in the future and takes away safety distractions students may have in school. 
7843	I think that seeking multiple opinions is the best choice for someone to make their own decision. 
7844	They will have more opinions to be influenced by, 
7845	they could have advantages and disadvantages about thinking of other people's opinions, 
7846	they could get more opinions from trusted adults who could have the same similarities. 
7847	Seeking multiple opinions will help them decide which opinions they would prefer to help them pick from. This person could have a number of options to decide from so that they will get more ideas for the advice they could recieve. Asking for advice from one person is not a very good way for getting opinions, because that person will not have as many options as a great deal of people could have. The person getting advice should not decide on one person to get opinion from because they might not get as many ideas as they would like to get. Having more opinions to influence from can make up a huge decision for a person that is seeking more to options. 
7848	They might not think that a lot of people have the best opinions for them but they can figure out which options they can pick out of a whole bunch. When they ask people for advice, they could get a number of good or bad reasons that they must choose from so that they can decide which ones they approve of the most. It might be hard for someone to figure out which options they should pick from unless you can pick a few opinions from each person and mix them up. One decision can contain different methods or opinions from someone and they do not have to be all the same thing. This person is able to decide whichever opinion they choose from even if there may be many consistent and inconsistent choices. 
7849	Different people will have different ideas and options from their perspectives on different kinds of things. It is best to decide whether or not they have the same opinions or ideas, to see if they could bond to make new decisions. Everyone that that person picks from to get advice, could have the same opinions as others or different. Depending on people you trust may have better opinions then those of the people you do not trust. This person might think that the people they do care about or know more, have more ideas to pick from and approve from because they know and trust them most. 
7850	Seeking multiple opinions for advice can help you greatly when you need to make a decision. 
7851	It helps to hear from people who hold different perspectives and beliefs, 
7852	have different experiences, 
7853	many different opinions.  
7854	by listening to just one person, you may only get that one person's opinion about what he or she believes is right. It is important to listen to what many others have to say in order to make the best decision for yourself. Recently, I got a bad grade on a math test. My grade hadn't gone below a 98% in Algebra so far. This test brought me down a whole letter grade. I didn't know if I should retake it or not. I knew it probably wouldn't bring my grade up much. However, I still didn't know what to do. I asked my Math teacher, my parents, and a few of my friends. Each looked at the situation differently. After listening to all of these perspectives, I put them together and formed my own decision. As long as I did my homework and got a good grade on the next test, I would be back up to an A and not have to retake it. I was helped a lot by getting different opinions of people with different backgrounds. 
7855	when preparing to go into 8th grade, I couldn't decide which elective class I should take. I narrowed the decision down to either Art or Tech Ed. I didn't know what to do, so I asked all three of my older sisters who had recently gone through Generic_School, the school that I was currently at. One of my sisters said she loved Art and I should take it. Another said that a lot of boys enjoy Tech Ed, and you get to build a lot of cool stuff. I was still on the fence, so I asked my dad. He said the stuff you do and the tools you use in Tech Ed will be a lot more useful as my life went on. I came to the final decision of Tech Ed. This is just one example of why asking for advice of multiple people with different experiences is so important. If I had just listened to what my first sister said, I would probably be doing Art. 
7856	seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. There are many different opinions out there. People look at things differently and have different beliefs, and everybody doesn't have the same experiences. Even on just little things like retaking a test or figuring out your courses for the upcoming year. Listening to other peoples opinions will always help you form the best one.  
7857	Do you want to know the best way to get help and make the best choice for yourself? All you need to do is get viewpoints from multiple people, and ask for their differing opinions. Why is this the best thing for you to do? 
7858	First of all, it lets you get the ideas of others. 
7859	All people will most certainly not have the same ideas, so you can see what other people have to say about things. You might be sided with one persons idea, then after being able to view other peoples idea, you might shift your viewpoints. This can be a good thing because you might not always have the best, or even the right idea for yourself. Viewing other peoples ideas and thinking about them can cause you to think about more than just one idea, so you can make the best out of others ideas. This can help you make good choices because it allows you to see multiple angles, not just one. 
7860	some people might have more experience with the sort of situation you are in. 
7861	For example, a person that is 15 might not have that good of advice for, let's say, parenting. Their advice is not valid because they have no experience. However, going to someone else, like a person in their thirties to forties, would have a much better advice that would help you in the situation, because they have had at least five to ten years of experience behind them. 
7862	I know that getting advice from more than one person is one of the best things you can do, is because it have done it in my life, and i have had some rewarding benefits. I had to do a project for school, where I had to make a model that displayed what I had learned in that unit. I did not really know what I was going to do, so I asked my parents. They helped me come up with an idea, but the rest was up to me. I then came to ask my older friend, who had done this project before. He helped me come up with how I was going to make it, and display it with confidence to the class. When all was said and done, I got an A on the project. Afterward, I pondered what I did in order to get the good grade. I remembered that I had sought the opinion and ideas of 3 different people, and I had done the very best I could have done. In the future, I would remember that project, and how rewarding it was to get help from multiple people.  
7863	The feeling of indecisiveness where your brain is waging war on itself, Google is giving out useless information, time is ticking, and you just wish someone was there to tell you what they think 
7864	Asking multiple people for their advice and opinion is better when making decisions. 
7865	Other people offer contrasting solutions 
7866	different opinions from life experiences 
7867	and give confidence and ease of mind.  
7868	When talking to different people about your problem, each of them will conjure very different solutions 
7869	"Listening to different ideas may inspire you to tweak you decision. When I had just moved into a different house, I was presented with an age old teenage dilemma: how to decorate my room? Consulting with my parents, sister, friends, and my wise pet dog, I settled on a blue comforter and yellow walls. However, when sometimes you've strained your brain but no solution has been thought up, the presented advice may end up being the one you pick. In the book  Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,  Harry Potter has no idea how to contact Sirius Black. Luckily for him, his friends do. With their help, a plan was hatched with the involvement of invisible gas and breaking into the headmaster's office, all things he wouldn't have thought of himself. My grandmother's saying, ""Our brains are crazy in different ways,"" in this case, is an extremely accurate expression. "
7870	Consulting with many people gives you a broader perspective and more knowledge towards making your decision 
7871	"When more people from different walks of life-whether it be age, ethnicity, or financial situation-give you advice, it allows you to realize which of their advice fits you the best. When my older brother was presented with the life deciding question of the future career path, the whole family weighed in. My grandfather, who survived the famine in China and grew up in poverty, suggested she strive for a stable and well paying office job. My aunt, a freelancer who grew up in the U.S, simply said, ""Follow your heart."" Compiling information from people who all lead very different lives allows you to see the bigger picture. "
7872	Listening to other people explain what they think allows you to have confidence in your own decision and ease self doubt, which some people experience. 
7873	"Whenever I have to make an important decision, I often become agitated and start doubting myself, listing reasons why I wasn't correct. Versus when advice is given from a unbiased outsider's point of view, it is often more rational and factual, rather than emotional. Yesterday, when my homework folder mysteriously disappeared, hearing my friends explain what they would do made me realize my problem wasn't as extreme as I made it out to be. The advice given to you can strengthen your decision by explaining why your choice is stronger, while adding points to why other options are weaker. A quote, this time from my little sister: ""A little confidence never hurt nobody."" "
7874	Hearing others' advice and solutions allows better decision-making. It gives room for wildly different ideas, wider perspectives, and more confidence in your own choice 
7875	Have you ever had to face a daunting challenge, and wondered why you didn't seek multiple people's advice for help? Whenever you find yourself in a new situation, there are plenty of people willing to voice their opinions out to you. 
7876	it is likely those people probably experienced the same things as you, 
7877	it is important to get several viewpoints on your scenario in case something unexpected happens 
7878	simply talking to more people can get more of the nerves and bad emotions out. 
7879	Facing a new scenario can be hard, and you probably will have bad emotions eating at your brain. Most people would agree that having someone to listen to you while you rant about these emotions will help you in the long run. They will inspire you to think optimistically. Being optimistic may even help you achieve greater accomplishments! You may be scared to talk to multiple people, but the more people you seek for advice, the better you will attack the situation with a clear mind. 
7880	In conclusion, seeking multiple people's opinions is more beneficial than only seeking one. You can face the situation knowing you did the best you could to prepare for it. Next time you you resort to only asking one person for advice, think twice because it will be helpful to talk to people who have experienced your situation, you will have more ways to overcome an unexpected challenge, and you can let all of your emotions out to everyone.   
7881	When asking for an opinion you might want to ask more than one person because the person you ask might have better advice than the other person. 
7882	people could have different personal opinions and points of view than others and their advice could help you out a lot in the future. 
7883	When you ask for someones opinion you should listen carefully to what they have to say. 
7884	if someone gives you advice that you do not agree with and you get upset just remember that everyone does not think exactly like you. People have their own personal opinions and they will sometimes tell you something that you do not like or want to hear . Now if someone gave you advice that you do not like do not ignore it take it as constructive criticism and listen to what they say and have a open mind about it. For example: Lets say you made some food and you add a little to much salt and your friend tells you that it is was to salty and that maybe you should have added less salt but you find the food to taste just right. Next time maybe dont add as much salt. This way you listen to your friends advice even though you disagree and if you find it alright and if they find the food better then you both dont lose nothing. And theres other ways to deal with this situation like not cooking that meal, but you decided to listen to your friends advice and in the end it all worked out. Its ok if people have different opinions then you and their advice isnt what you would like to hear but its good that you learn from them. 
7885	You are walking through all the different houses. There are so many to pick, and you have to choose the right one for the right price. This house looks aesthetic, but this one's cheaper. This one has a bigger backyard, but this one is in a better community. There are too many ways where you could go wrong. You end up calling up your friends to help you look through the options. You've all been there before, whether it was making decisions as big as buying the right house or as small as what restaurant to eat at. 
7886	In order to get the good advice you need, you should ask more than one person. 
7887	you will have more options on what to do, 
7888	different views and opinions on the situation, 
7889	less stress about the decision. 
7890	While one solution may not work very well, another may be the best one for you. Asking more people also increases the chances of finding someone who had to make the same decision or was in the same situation. This would be incredibly helpful because they could give advice on what they chose to do and the result. For example, when I was working on a difficult math problem, I asked many people for their ideas on how to approach it. Though some of them could not solve the problem or help me, others came up with brilliant solutions. One of them had seen a similar problem before, so he pointed me in the right direction. By asking more than one person for advice, I received many choices from which I could pick the best one. 
7891	sometimes choices are not enough, and we need to understand the options better.  
7892	Everyone can view an issue differently depending on personal experience or background knowledge. 
7893	However, when others also understand your situation, it is a lot less of a weight to carry. Talking to more than one person can help relieve the stress a lot more than if it is carried by only one or two people. For instance, I was very stressed about an upcoming competition and I could not focus on studying. I explained my situation to many of my friends and they helped me calm down and gave me advice on how to focus and study. Getting advice from many people helped me relieve my stress and do well at the competition. I felt more calm because of the support from my friends after getting advice. Making sure you are not stressed is very important because it could affect your studies and relationship with friends and family. By asking more than one person for advice, you will most likely be less stressed. 
7894	Listening to multiple options, knowing the pros and cons of each side, and relieving decision-making stress are all reasons why you should ask more than one person for advice. You always want to make the right choice, especially for bigger decisions like buying a house. Getting to know all your options and the pros and cons of each is very important for making the best choice for you. However, this could be very stressful and asking all your friends for advice will make sure you feel supported and less stressed. 
7895	When asking people for advice, usually asking a close friend or a trusted adult is what first comes to mind. In some cases, More than one person needs to be asked. 
7896	When advice is needed asking more than one person can be better than just asking one. 
7897	In the event that advice is needed, asking two or maybe even three people can be a lot more reassuring. New ideas are brought to the table meaning more options to choose from when the decision needs to be made. As an example, Generic_Name might not know what to do when the school bully tells him to meet him after school on the blacktop to fight. Generic_Name asks his friend what to do and his friend has the same idea as him. Asking two or three people might give new or maybe even better ideas than the one that he thought of. So now Generic_Name is avoiding the fight, and is safe because his other friends told him to tell the principal. 
7898	Asking more than one person might also add to your idea. 
7899	Making better decisions is another outcome for asking multiple people for advice. 
7900	As an example, Generic_Name is at the shoe store looking for some new shoes for school. He is trying to get the newest pairs of Jordans' because he wanted to be the first at his school to have them, but they are way too expensive. On the other hand, he could get a much cheaper pair of Air Force Ones but then he would look like everyone else. Generic_Name is really indecisive, so he calls his friend to see what he says. his friend tells him to buy the Jordan but they are too expensive. Generic_Name then asks his dad, and his dad says the Air Force Ones are much more affordable and look good too. Generic_Name not knowing what to do suddenly remembers that basketball season is coming up, and the only pair of basketball shoes are beaten up and dirty. Generic_Name then asks one of the employees that work there is they have any basketball shoes. The employee directs him to the basketball section and Generic_Name sees the basketball shoes hes been wanting, and at an affordable price. 
7901	"There are times when you need some advice, and a lot of it. Asking more than one person is better in many different ways. Some for making better decisions, and some just to hear the opinions of others and what they think is the best thing to do. Someone once said, ""  two heads are better than one"". "
7902	Recently more and more schools are offering online classes as an alternative to attending classes in a school building. Although some parents may argue that online classes could potentially make students lazy, students would actually benefit greatly from online classes. Students could get their eight hour sleep schedules each night if they attend classes online because their schedules would be more flexible. Online classes could have a schedule that accommodates to all its students needs. Online classes will be beneficial to students suffering from sickness and mental health issues and stress levels among students could lower. 
7903	Distance learning is an option all students should have because it would be beneficial to students.  
7904	Online classes could have a more flexible schedule that could accommodate for each of their student's needs. 
7905	All students have different circumstances. Some students have sicknesses or mental health issues that make attending schools difficult but online classes would help no one fall behind. Students with social anxiety and depression struggle to be motivated to attend school each day but online classes could help these students. People suffering from depression can often feel unmotivated to leave their houses or be around other people, but online classes would limit the amount of unwanted interaction students would have to have and allow them to feel more comfortable, and work at their own pace. 
7906	Students with social anxiety can feel overwhelmed in a school setting, and can even experience panic attacks. If schools gave students the option to have online classes, the ones suffering from anxiety would feel more motivated to do school work. Unfortunately, some students are suffering from sicknesses which make them feel weak and physically unable to attend school everyday. 
7907	Most middle school and high school students don't receive the recommended eight hours of sleep each night because of how early they have to attend school, but online classes could change this. 
7908	Usually students go to bed around 10:00pm or even later than this; and wake up at around 5:30am or 6:00am depending on what time school starts. Many AP or IB students lose sleep because of the large homework load they receive. So students that take AP or IB classes could start their online courses later in the day and receive the right amount of sleep each day. Having eight hours of sleep can increase productivity among students and possibly receive better grades on worksheets, homework, and tests. If students are able to wake up later and get plenty of time to sleep, they will feel more motivated to work hard and finish their assignments. School can be stressful and getting the right amount of sleep can help ease this.  
7909	Recently, students haven't felt safe in their schools. During a crisis, students could have classes online to keep students feeling safe. 
7910	School shootings have struck fear into many students and have caused them to feel unsafe in schools. Online classes could prevent any of these tragedies from potentially occurring again and students can feel safe again. Students will be in the safety of their own homes and won't have to worry about the about the possibility of any intruders harming them or their peers. The Coronavirus has also fear in many people. People don't want to leave their homes or even travel anymore because of the possibility of obtaining this sickness, and this includes students. Many areas have had people infected with the virus which has caused many outbreaks to cancel schools because students are afraid of getting the Coronavirus. If students attended classes online, they wouldn't have to worry about getting inflected with the Coronavirus.  
7911	Students in all kinds of difficult circumstances would benefit greatly from taking online classes. Students suffering from mental health issues like anxiety and depression and students with sicknesses will have the option to take online classes and they will have a schedule more accommodated to their needs. All students including students that take AP, IB, or harder level classes classes will be able to receive more hours of sleep if online classes are an option, and during a crisis students would feel much safer attending classes online from home.  
7912	These almost everyone has a phone and even now at schools everyone is on them. I think that the with being home and having classes the phone will be like one of the main problem because of how addicting it is 
7913	Because one person might have better advice than some other person they asked if they asked multiple people for advice 
7914	Also asking muliple people for advice can help people make a better choice becauce other people might have diffrent advice or diffrent expereances with thething the person is asking them. 
7915	Distance Learning can be very beneficial in some aspects, but in others it can be very detrimental to kids and their families. If kids started taking more online classes it could ruin their high school experience. It can also cause them to become very anti-social with them being at home all of the time and not being at school in class. This may also cause them to get in to more trouble with being at home 24/7, which can also lead to kids not doing their work and not graduating because of it 
7916	Kids need to go to school 
7917	have a good experience of high school before college, 
7918	stay connected with friends so they do not feel left out when they try to speak with people in public 
7919	Kids can lose their high school experience if taking online classes. 
7920	There will be no dances that are held for the students that take online classes and they will not be able to participate in regular after school activities. They won't have a homecoming or prom that they can get a date to because of this. This is one of the biggest parts of high school; being able to go to prom and have fun with your friends or significant other. School Dances are meant to be fun, and if they take online courses this is something they can not attend. Another big loss is they won't have the chance to go see big sports events and participate in the crowd while cheering on their team, or even play on the team and create a bond with their teammates. Students will miss out on spirit week which a very special week that everyone in the school looks forward to because everyone loves this week. It is a laid back week of where you decorate floats and class rooms all leading up to the big varsity football game, which they won't be able to have if they take these online classes at home. High school is something you need to experience in life, and if students stayed home and took online classes they wouldn't have an actual high school, so they would be missing out on most things if not everything that happens throughout high school. 
7921	This can also hurt students because of them not being in a classroom with other students; they can very easily become very anti-social, and not know how to communicate very well to others. 
7922	They will not constantly have to talk to teachers or other classmates about work, or have to work on a project in a group, which can help them tremendously with people skills. They generally will not make friends or see any of their friends because of them being at home while their friends are at school, which can cause anti-socialism. They will not be in class interacting with other teachers and students, which can lead to them not having confidence in talking or not wanting to talk to other people or students. 
7923	This is also just an important thing you need in life cause everything you do will require human interaction when you become an adult and try to get a job. 
7924	When you are seeking for help, what do you do? You probably ask people. When I ask people for help I get lots of good answers. 
7925	Asking for questions is better than staying quiet and not knowing. 
7926	hen you ask mulitiple people for help, you can get a wide variety of answers that will help answer your question. 
7927	For example: When I had difficulty learning a unit in math, I asked multiple friends and got multiple answers that helped me learn it. Asking one person alone can get you answers but asking more people is better because maybe if you ask one, they could be wrong and all the others could be right. For example: I asked my friend the answer to a question, he was wrong but I asked my other friends and they were right. When you are seeking for help try to ask questions. When you ask questions you get right answers. In conclusion, asking questions leads to answers and less questions. 
7928	Asking multiple people for advice can, help you with a delimia, get you different opinions from different standpoints on a situation, and can make sure you are making a wise decision instead of an impulsive one. 
7929	You have a job at a retail marketing company as the social media manager, making 13 dollars and hour, have only been working for them for 4 months, and is only a 15 minute drive from your house. But there is another job offer, it is also a retail market company, but you would handle finances, and get paid 22 dollars an hour, and it is the next state over and is a 3 hour drive, you have all of your family here and just bought a house, your degree is in consumer finances. What do you do? You seek advice from a lot of people, get their opinions, see which one is better for you future, and make a decision off of the advice given to you. Remember, get multiple peoples' advice and opinions to make a wise decision instead of an impulsive one. 
7930	Not all students are the same and their varied conditions may affect their opportunity to obtain an education. Distance learning is a new innovative technique that some schools implement to offer online education at home. This technique can be offered in many ways such as: online video, conferencing, and online courses. Distance learning can be very beneficial for all students in any level of education 
7931	it can be very convenient for students who suffer from illnesses and can't attend school 
7932	it allows students to work at their own pace 
7933	it allows students to work when it is mostly convenient for them. 
7934	Implementing distance learning can decrease the attendance issue most schools face. 
7935	Students miss school due to many factors; One of the main reasons why students miss schools is due to illnesses. Students who deal with very severe illnesses such as cancer are forced to not attend school for long periods of time. Which can hinder the student's future. Even illnesses that aren't very severe can still negatively affect students because most illnesses can be easily transmitted, such as the common cold, which can put other students' health at risk. To prevent this issue schools should offer distance learning by allowing the students to attend classes from anywhere whether it's their homes or hospitals. Students who suffer from health problems don't have to miss out on their education and get the same opportunity to learn like every healthy student. 
7936	Distance learning also allows students to work at their own pace which can be an advantage to students; 
7937	Specially to those who have learning disabilities. Teachers work at the same pace with every student. Which isn't helpful for students as their minds work differently and their comprehension levels vary. Some students learn slower than others and most teachers don't recognize that. With distance learning each student can learn at the pace that is appropriate for them. Distance learning is also very helpful as the teacher's focus shifts to each individual student rather than the class as a whole. Online conferencing allows the teacher to understand the student more and asses their abilities. This helps teachers divide students based on what learning techniques is appropriate for them. Which can result in increased student performance. 
7938	Distance learning is very beneficial for students as they have the option to work when they are motivated and when it is convenient for them 
7939	Most students attend school with less than 5 hours to sleep due to sleeping late because of homework. Students who have the opportunity to work from home don't have to wake up early. Distance learning allows students to do online courses when they are energized, which doesn't have to be in the morning. This can improve the student's efficiency level and improve their performance. Not all students' physiological needs are met yet they are expected to work with no breaks during school hours. This is due to school hours not being enough for teachers to cover all the content that needs to be covered. Distance learning allows students to take breaks when they feel the need to. Giving students this autonomy can be more motivating to them. 
7940	Overall students' conditions vary from student to student. Each student is unique in that they have different minds and thinking levels. Which is why i believe that distance learning is a very innovative and useful technique that should be provided by all schools as learning option for students. Distance learning provides many opportunities for all students because it can is very useful for students who are sick and can't attend school, it can be helpful for students as they are working at their own pace, and it allows students to work whenever is convenient to them. 
7941	the person could see the problem from different perspectives, 
7942	the person could get information that the other person asked didnt know, 
7943	there is the off chance that the person could be getting biased advice from the person without knowing. 
7944	asking for advice from multiple people is helpful and is recommended to many people when dealing with a problem where they can use some advice with a problem they are struggling with. 
7945	sometimes a problem can only be solved when you take a step back and try to look at in a new way, and talking to multiple people concerning the topic can help someone do this. For example, say someone got into an argument with a friend after being offended by something the friend said, after they talked to multiple people about this they then could see that the friend didnt mean to offend him/her. If the person had not gone to someone else for advice then they wouldn't have realized that the friend was sorry and didnt mean to offended him/her, by talking to multiple people it helped them make a better choice. Besides helping people look at their problem from a different perspective, talking to multiple people can still help people make better choices in other ways, they could get information from someone that the previous people that they talked to didnt know, and the information could help influence their decision. 
7946	For example, in a 6rd grade class there was a boy who had trouble in history class, there was a history test on the following Friday, the boy was worried so he asked his best friend, Generic_Name what he should do, Generic_Name told him not to stress and that to study and he'll be fine. He trusted his friend's advice but asked his other friend, Generic_Name, just to be sure, his other friend told him that the test was 20 questions mostly surrounding the declaration of independence, after getting this information he studied his notes surrounding the declaration of independence and ended up getting a 98% on his history test, due to knowing what to expect. The boy at first only asked his best friend but after getting advice from another person, he understood what the test was about and what he should do. This method of asking multiple people for advice helped him and if he had not asked his other friend for advice, he would have been unprepared for the test. Besides the reasons to ask multiple people for advice, getting a different perspective and getting additional information,there is still another major reason to ask multiple people for advice, which is on the off chance that the first person(s) they asked were biased, and didnt give them direct information based on facts and not opinions. 
7947	For example, at lunch there was an argument between 4 friends about DC vs Marvel movies and a mutual friend of the 4 was forced to chose a side in the argument, the mutual friend had never seen a DC or Marvel movie and didnt know anything about them, she went to ask advice about which side to choose from one of her friends that was on side DC, they told her that DC was better in special effects, plot and actors. She trusted her friend's advice but to make sure she had all the information she asked her older brother, someone who had seen all DC and Marvel movies and wasnt someone who had picked a side and genuinely supported both sided, her brother told her that DC and Marvel were both amazing franchises, but generally Marvel had a bigger budget and that they had more plot detail. After talking to her brother and her friend, she came to the conclusion that she believed Marvel was better franchise wise. The girl at first did not know what to do and after consulting her DC friend she was convinced DC was better, but after talking to her brother, who didnt chose a side, realized that she, personally, supported Marvel. If she did not go to another source for advice then she wouldn't have known that her DC friend was biased and embellished on a lot of details. With all of this it clear that asking for advice from multiple people helped her chose a better choice. 
7948	whether someone has a small problem like which franchise they support or if its a more intricate problem like a miss communication that could destroy a life long friendship, no matter how big or small the problem is asking advice is always something that helps and asking multiple people for advice could help make a better choice when dealing with a problem. Asking multiple people helps when someone needs a new perspective, additional information of the topic or if they just arent sure if the person they are getting advice from is biased.  In all asking for advice from multiple people is helpful solution and is highly recommended to many people when dealing with a problem where they can use some advice with a problem they are struggling with. 
7949	When receiving advice, the response you get will be different from everyone. This is because everyone views things from a different standpoint. Some people think it's best to keep their not so positive opinions to themselves, while other are going to share everything with you. It's important to have both these kinds of people in your life, because they're both needed in different situations. Let's say, for instance, you get a new shirt that you absolutely love. You probably want to hear from your peers that it looks great on you. Now, let's say you are shopping and find shoes that you aren't too sure about. In this situation, you're probably wanting to hear from your more honest friend, who will truthfully tell you how they look 
7950	You also might want to hear from multiple people, because everyone has a different style and opinion.  
7951	If you have an issue with a friend and you only ask for advice from one person, you're only getting one side of the story. If you ask for advice from multiple people, you are going to get many different sides of the story 
7952	If you're talking to your parents they might give you different advice then a friend might give you. Generally, parents will be a little more comforting and give you good advice about not worrying too much about it, while a friend might know more about the person whom you're having issues with and give you more advice on how to actually solve the problem. Both these opinions are great, but they're both different, which shows that it's important to have both these opinions rather than just one. It's also very important to have someone who will just listen to you, while others will do the talking while you listen to them. It's also a good idea to get advice from both males and females, because they tend to have different perspectives, which can be beneficial in certain situations. 
7953	seeking multiple opinions on a topic is always a good idea. Whether it's as simple as choosing an outfit, or as complicated as loosing a friend, theres always room for more advice. Receiving advice from many people is helpful in many ways and always works out better then getting advice from just one person. It can be hard to make decisions, but with others help it can be a lot more simple and your decision will probably end up being better than if you were to make it yourself. 
7954	When it comes to seeking advice, it is always good to look for different sources. It is very valuable to have opinions from other people that a person can lean on. It is common for people to ask others for things from simple, to complicated scenarios. 
7955	I believe looking for multiple opinions from different people when a person asks for advice to make a better decision is important because it could lead the person's mind up to more options 
7956	it could lead the person to very opinionated or buyist thoughts 
7957	could help take stress of the person when needing advice. 
7958	It can help if you have a friend or family member you can trust that has a strong opinion, because sometimes you need it. There is always going to be a couple or strong people in your life that's going to help you make right decisions either if you are going down the wrong road, or if you are doing the right thing in life and you just need motivation. If a person was struggling in high school and they really needed to step up their life and grown up more, they would really need to good influences or somebody to tell them where they are going wrong. People that can step up with their own voice on the situation that has known the person, and that could really help them get their life together. Personally, the type of people everyone needs is somebody that has strong beliefs and values and that would care for their loved ones. That could especially help in benefiting someone's life going toward the future 
7959	But with almost 30 years of technology being developed since he was last in a classroom, you can theoretically instead do it online and cut out physical school entirely from your educational life. This development has potential to change education for the better of pretty much all of us. 
7960	Recently, a virus known as Covid-19 has been threatening to have schools closed at the first sign of infection, but this is little to no problem with digital education. 
7961	This could be an important step forward into fully online schooling. education of the past has gone through various phases as technology and civilization as a whole becomes more advanced; going from purely parental, to small single room schooling, to where it is now: large scale public schools. The problem now is that we're struggling to move onto the next system as it's such a leap from what most of us are familiar with. 
7962	The advent of long distance schooling could very well be the middle man to bridge the gap, as it's essentially the current system, but augmented with the digital age. 
7963	But this can easily be disputed, as various jobs are also shifting towards being heavily online. Being physically present is being phased out in almost every profession that doesn't need it in 2020. As for comprehension, digital technology is extremely versatile; it can be bent and modified to any extent that a person needs in order to be successful. 
7964	Now this isn't something as easily done in this in-between version we're talking about, but the virtual classroom of the possible future is more than up to the task; which is why it would also be important to have the evolution be steady but swift. Education really should only stick in the shifting phase for as long as it needs to, so that we can learn about the best course and make sure that the people caught in it aren't tossed around into confusion. 
7965	Essentially, education is about to become exceedingly easier and more efficient than ever before (that's a lot of Es but hang in there). As long as it is made sure that the right steps are taken, schooling will no longer be bound by a location or time and arguably be the way that a new large-scale revolution can take place, not bottle necked by the limitations of a system that, while did what it needed to do, was intended for a long gone era. But then again, as said long ago, constraints conjure creativity, and maybe there's a radically different thing set for the future of learning; we just don't know it yet. 
7966	Some people might be scared to ask for advice. They may feel ashamed of doing so. 
7967	Despite this, I strongly believe that asking for advice will help to result in a better decision. 
7968	by giving different points of view, 
7969	allowing one to think about their decision, 
7970	This results in being able to see how others actually feel. Someone else might see something in a totally different way then you see it. They might show something that is completely obvious that you never saw. Better ideology and reasons might be received as well. Doing so opens up new possibilities for different ideas. Asking others for their opinion certainly gives multiple points of view. 
7971	This gives the person seeking advice more time to decide how they feel. Time is needed to make a good decision so taking your time is strongly advised. It can also result in more in depth thoughts. The end result will conclude in a better final decision with a better reason behind it. 
7972	Whether it is the person your asking or asking about, they will appreciate the thought. Not only will they feel appreciative, but they know that you care. They will feel involved with ones life. They also might ask for your advice one day knowing you asked them. Wanting someones opinion will prove to them that you care about them in many ways.  
7973	seeking advice is strongly advised. Asking for opinions is a quality many will never receive. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice by giving different points of view, allowing one to think about their decision, and by showing others you care. 
7974	There are many reasons I can think of why people need more than one persons advice and some are life changing. 
7975	Now this reason would probably apply to someone who is seeking advice before a decision. An example of this reason : Generic_Name needs a new bike,so he goes in the bike shop and ask his friends for advice on which bike he should get and they do now. Generic_Name goes to the counter and the cashier gives him some advice so now he can compare and contrast the bikes in his head and decide which one to get. In the example Generic_Name has three point of views on the different bikes so he could easily make a choice. This is like research but from people who have done the research. Also Advice comes from friends and family mostly so you Know it isn't bad advice. 
7976	maybe you don't even know if it is bad advice that is why always get more than one person to get advice from. Now for an example: You just turned twenty and you're still living with your parents so you go to your bad friend house because you think he has cool job probably. So you get to his house then ask him and he says you could join my gang we do cool things and get a lot a money you think about talking to your other friend but then you say yes anyway. The next day you go to jail for murder because your friend comited murder to rob a bank. You were sitting in a car waiting for your friend to get out of the bank you didn't think that he hurt or robed anyone. Now you in prison for forty years and your friend for life. When you were about to get your good friends advice you didn't but if you did you would realize how bad of an idea that is and would of been fine, so never be to careful. 
7977	Have you ever wanted to know if your attending a classes from home does it benefit you ? Many students want to be educated and successful but, many problems come in there way causing public or private schools not to be the best decision for them. They decide they want to do school online and have said it has befitted them so much because, when they were doing public school they were failing there classes or the problems they were facing got harder for them to be in school. 
7978	Many students have done online school and have been so successful and not only being successful but it has benefited them in whatever situation They're in right now. 
7979	Although some may argue otherwise, but through family experiences 
7980	prodcasts i've watched on the radio 
7981	from hearing some celebrities talk. 
7982	One of my cousins named Generic_Name has been through so much and has not been able to continue going to public school. she's struggling a lot trying to keep her grades up and trying to get to school on time. she has an eating disorder. An eating disorder can be really hard at times when dealing with that and school . 
7983	Her family has decided to let her do online school , and has helped her so much because while being at home eating and also going to doctor appointments she has the option to do her assignments online and also sometimes some teachers come to her house do homework assignments with her that help her a ton. 
7984	"Through online school she has overcame her struggle with her eating disorder and has also been so successful. As many years went by she has studied more an more. ""it's so crazy""  because while having so many problems she was facing she became a lawyer. "
7985	Some may argue that it's impossible how she became a lawyer after just doing online school, that its unfair how she got to where she is now because of home schooling, some people may say that by doing online school it can't benefit you nor can it make you a successful person it's just they way to failure. 
7986	That's not true because when you hear so many stories and people talking about their experiences with home schooling you have to take to consideration that maybe it helps some and not others. 
7987	Many prodcasts on the radio have mentioned many real life situations on this subject . 
7988	One i've heard that struck out to me was when this mom was talking about her son Generic_Name being really popular on social media, She said that all throughout his high school years students his age and older have been bullying him and trying to get in fights with him for no reason. The mom signed her son up for online schooling. Generic_Name did online school as well as he did video conferences with his teachers every other day . Generic_Name has found it to be more easy he said that he is more concentrated because, it's just him and his laptop there's no distractions no more students bothering him trying to fight him. Since social media is such a big thing to keep up with when doing online school ,he can do both social media and be educated. 
7989	However, some may argue that Generic_Name has to be a man and grow up, he can't always hide from people that are mean to him. That's true he can't always hide from people like that, 
7990	but if he's fed up with it then maybe it was the best decision you can only handle so much hate.  
7991	Celebrities have talked in their interviews about them choosing home school over school and how beneficial it was to them. 
7992	There's this girl named Generic_Name .She said Being big on social media is really hard Dealing with the hate, dealing with people exposing you constantly for nothing, dealing with your name always being in people's mouth. Generic_Name has said that she's been bullied so many times and has found it harder for to deal with it. She has said that at one point she got depression and got harder and harder for her to continue going to public schools. Teachers recommended her to do online school. She took that advice and did home schooling for the rest of high school and also did online school for college as well. She said that she feels more successful. Generic_Name said that online school was the best thing she did and that she decided that for college she is going to a public college and she is also going to continue being big on social media. 
7993	Some may argue that, They don't see how it benefited her. It have a major change on her, she knew what she wanted to do or be so how did it benefit her. 
7994	It benefited her in so many ways, she no longer is afraid of what people think of her on social media. Sometimes people need space from public school and then when they feel that they are ready they can go to public schools again. 
7995	The importance is for people that are going through the same problems for them to look and read from past experiences. For them to see if online school is beneficial for them. In the future people can look back at this and see what people were going through and how much they were struggling. This helps to see about how the past was like to compare to how it's like now. A solution is for people to do online school if they feel like being in public school is harder for them or for, whatever reason it may be. Also for people to notice and to realize that as being said multiple times that for people that are big on social media It's hard to cope with all the hate they get. A solution is for people not to give hate to others.  
7996	In my oppinion, it is not a good idea to set at home learning and take classes at home and watching videos. 
7997	a great reason for going to another opinion for help is the fact that they won't sugarcoat the truth from you. 
7998	They may not know you as well as your parents do and it could ultimately benefit you to hear the hard truth about the matter at hand. When you get constructive criticism from a peer it allows you to do a self evaluation on your problems and the different solutions you could use to solve your problems. That peer will always want the best out of you because it may be a close friend and they will understand you a bit better and they will always tell you your problem and try to help you understand what is wrong and what you should do. When you go to a second opinion you have to look back and think if you held back anything when you were talking to them, and if you didnt than you should expect them not to hold any of their emotions or feelings about the problem to you. 
7999	they will always want to listen and seek understanding about your problems. 
8000	"If you are talking to family member they may not care about your problems or say something along the lines of ""oh honey it's ok you will be fine"" and them saying that is not fine and you should never be satisfied with that answer from anyone. Your friend or close peer, like a teacher or coach will want to understand your issue and they want to help you at all costs because they know that your a good kid and they never want to see you down,moody or upset ever. Your coaches put you through struggle and so do you teachers so they know you can handle the hard moments in life and want to always help you, so you can make the right decision. whenever you hear a question in class you want to seek understanding about the question so you can answer it the next time someone asks. The issue hear is very similar to that and when you have a problem or issue that you believe needs a second opinion they will always be willing to listen. That way they can ultimately impact your decision for the better and you will be so relieved and you will ask yourself why you didn't go to them earlier "
8001	when you go to an alternative opinion about a concern they can show you a different perspective of the situation at hand. Which then helps you become a better problem solver in general 
8002	I personally have always believed in the idea of going to a second opinion about an issue and I always want to help people with their problems just like they help me with mine. You should never discredit your parent or guardians opinion because they could ultimately be correct when it's all said and done. However the minute you start only listening to your parents is the minute when your friends lose trust in you, and you lose trust in them. Remember that whenever a conflict is resolved or your problem is fixed you always have to credit someone for helping you with your problem and if that person is someone other than your parents than you have learned that your peers may be less experienced but they could be just as wise and just as intelligent as your parent or guardian. Finally when you make your ultimate decision based on the advice you were given you are very well informed and you can learn the different perspectives and different lessons that can be taught by different people and you come out of the experience so much wiser and smarter than you ever were before. 
8003	going to a second opinion is beneficial towards your decision making and ultimately will help you in the long run with whatever issues arise. 
8004	Do you want your advice to help you make the best choice? When people ask for advice, they tend to ask more than one person because they want to make the better choice for themselves. People who want to make the best choice look for credibility, different ideas, and different views, and they do this by asking many different kinds of people from young to old, people from different countries, and more. They want as much opinions as possible so they can narrow it down to one idea that will help them make the best choice. For example, a student might be researching about the Civil War for their history paper. They might ask their history teacher for ideas because their teacher happens to be history major. The student decides to ask their parents about their views and ideas and it just so happens that they are both professors with a PhD in history. The student gathers all the opinions they got and writes the paper and gets an A. The student knew they were going to pass because they asked people who were experts on history, and listened to their different views and ideas. 
8005	because of credibility 
8006	people have different ideas, 
8007	people have different views. 
8008	Everybody wants their advice to be credible and not bogus, so they seek out different websites, books, and people. If a person was having an argument and says that Alexander Hamilton was the best Founding Father and wanted to know more about him, they might go watch the musical,  Hamilton . That is just one source, so they decide to read a biography about him. The person decides to go on History. com to research more about the Founding Father, and even visits New York City, the place where Hamilton lived most of his life. The person decides that that is enough information and is satisfied with what they have learned. They know all the information is credible because of all the primary and secondary sources they have used and declares that Alexander Hamilton was the best Founding Father. Credibility is really important when it comes to making a decision and can be difficult when there are many different sources to choose from. 
8009	People have different ideas when it comes to almost everything, for example, an art project, which song to perform, which restaurant to go to, and more. If an artist wanted to paint a mural, they would ask other artists for their opinions and what type of message they should go for. One artist might suggest to use vibrant colors, while another might suggest dark colors. One artist might suggest to spread the message on a humanitarian crisis, while another might suggest to spread the message on powerful women. The artist painting the mural decides to go for vibrant colors and to spread the message on powerful women to make it stand out and let people be informed. Getting different ideas from other people is useful when it comes to making a choice when ideas are not coming to mind. 
8010	People have many types of different views when it comes to their favorite subject at school, their favorite genre of music, politics, and more. Politics, for instance, has people raging with which candidate and platform they think is the best, or they attend protests to support women's rights and to spread word about climate change. According to a recent survey, 95% of students at Generic_School think that everyone should be treated equally. Not everyone at Generic_School has the same views when it comes to equality, politics, or any sort of matter, so when a student wants different views on a certain topic, they might ask their peers. Another student might want to know more about a candidate running for president, so they ask people from different parties, goes to the candidate's website, and researches more about their platform. The student decides which candidate is the best after researching hearing about others' views. Hearing different views from people is a good way to make the final choice. 
8011	making a choice is difficult than it already is, and making the best choice does not seem like it is any more luxurious. Some people might be able to decisions at the speed of light without getting any opinions, while others might need some more opinions in order to make their decision. Life is all about making choices everyday and people have to accept the results that come out of it. Some people might be more carefree about it, while others might need to think more before they make a choice. Wanting to make the best choice is not selfish at all and is just a part of life. Wanting the credibility, different ideas and views from people is just another way of making the best choice. Therefore, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because of credibility, people have different ideas, and people have different views. 
8012	Everyone has an opinion, some are helpful, yet others just are going to make your life worse. You might ask why anyone would care about someone else's opinion, well it's hard to answer that question. You see, having multiple opinions can help limit the bias from the first opinion you received. Thus, why wouldn't you want to have multiple opinions, well it's quite simple, it's because people in our world are too scared to ask for others opinion or their advice. When asking for advice you are receiving wisdom, this wisdom can guide you to many great things, or it could lead you to absolute disaster. You will be guided into doing the wrong things in your life however you could stop all of that with a bit of advice. Having an opinion from one person can be very helpful, but just imagine if you could see both sides of your problem, thus leading you to obtain enough information on your problem and make the right choice. 
8013	wisdom from those around you is helpful, 
8014	it will help limit bias, 
8015	two opinions is always better than one. 
8016	Bias, bias is a thing no one should want in the opinions they are receiving. It is never a good choice to make to accept a biased opinion as a truth. Staying away from a biased opinion will benefit in so many unbelievable ways one could be eliminating the untruthful opinions from your life. It can be very unhelpful as well, these biased opinions could lead you down a road you should not go down. You can have a very bright future awaiting for you, but the one bias opinion you listen to can and will destroy your life. You might ask how could it destroy your life in an instant, well people will look at you differently based off the one bad biased opinion you listened to, and building that former life you previously had will virtually be impossible. 
8017	Wisdom is one of the most important things you will ever receive. Wisdom can be received or given by anyone such as your peers and elders. Everyone you meet will always have a choice to make therefore for every choice you have to make daily will effect your life forever. Some however will not be as big as others deciding what you will have fir dinner is no where as big of a decision as what you will do when your house burns down or you lose your job. 
8018	It you have two opinions you will be able to see both sides of the problem therefore making it easier to for you to make the right choice. Having only one opinion is definitely worse than having multiple because you are unable to have the option to see the other side. The one opinion could lead you into making some wrong choices, yet have multiple will lead to make some of the better choices that you could have made. Having the most opinions possible could change your life for the better, and possibly make your life easier. Although, receiving multiple opinions could sound easy it is quite difficult, due to the fact that nit everyone is going to want to help you. Some people in our world will not want you to succeed. However one opinion is worse than having multiple because you are unable to see everything that could be harmful towards you. 
8019	Obtaining multiple opinions for your problem is helpful for making the right choice because personal experience or wisdom is helpful, helps take away biased opinions, and multiple opinions from others is always better than one opinion. Who would care about others opinions, finding the answer will be almost impossible. Multiple opinions can limit the bias you have previously been given. Why would you even want to obtain opinions from others if they are all bad, well that's not true, opinions from others can be good for you to listen to. Wisdom form others should be a big part in the choices you make. However, you will have to be sure that they persons' opinion you are listening is trying to help you. Opinions come in two forms good and bad however you must do everything in your power to only listen to the good and not harmful opinions. 
8020	Do you remember a time or moment when you where having trouble making a decision for yourself and sought for advice? I'm sure we all have done that. When we don't know what to do we often ask people for their opinion and ask what they would do in these type of situations 
8021	Multiple opinions make us feel more secure about a decision we make. 
8022	We also get different point of views and feedback. 
8023	In some cases, you even get opinions from personal experiences.  
8024	When it comes to indecisive decisions, i tend to ask other people what they think and what they would do. When i was younger, i had two options of either joining a soccer team or learn how to play guitar. I was really into soccer but i've always wanted to learn how to play the guitar. This was obviously a very hard decision and i kept going back and forth about what i should choose. I ended up asking my cousins for their opinions. Most of them said i should learn guitar since i'd be learning something new instead of playing soccer which i had already knew how to play. I quickly made my mind and chose guitar lessons and didn't feel any regret when choosing guitar. 
8025	There are many other reasons opinions are so helpful but they help us in ways like making us feel more secure about a decision. They also give us feedback and different point of views. In some cases, opinions are given by personal experiences. Opinions are something you should consider when you're having trouble deciding something. It also helps you get a better understanding and make you feel more safe about decisions for important situations. 
8026	You are sitting in your chair. The plastic hurts your legs and back as it curves in an uncomfortable position, ill-adapted to your person. The intolerable buzz of the air conditioning that does nothing to cool the over-heated room drones at your ears, making it impossible to focus. The dull, artificial bulbs that in no way compensate for natural sunlight burn away at your eyes, giving you headache after headache. The other kids are yelling and blasting music, talking instead of doing the work you have been told to complete in an unreasonable, almost impossible time. The work you are doing makes no sense to you and you feel incompetent as those around you breeze by effortlessly. You need to ask the teacher about your work but shes busy grading papers, paying no attention to the class you have been forced into. You can not focus on a single word of your assignment, and even if you could understand it, you would not be able to complete it, because that same day youve already had three tests and two quizzes and all you want is to go home and take a short nap to recharge your brain. You long for some solution to your endless problems in the classroom, and you realize there is another way. 
8027	First and foremost, being able to work in a comfortable environment is crucial to focusing and being able to produce the best work possible. 
8028	While at school, students are being crammed into small classrooms with masses of other students, leaving each individual cramped. With only a square foot of desk space to write on, and the inability to move freely due to the molecule ratio of classroom size to students present, students are unable to concentrate on a given task. Scientists have proven through various studies that being comfortable while working has a direct effect on ones ability to produce quality work. By giving students the opportunity to work away from school, the comforts of home will aid in excelling the learning process. Students are also fed ill-nutritious foods in unnaturally short lunch periods, causing masses of students to consume foods that decrease brain power. When students are given less then 15 minutes to stuff their faces with greasy carbs before being shoved back into their classrooms, the students ability to work is compromised in ways like never before. By allowing students to work at home, they also have access to more nutritious food with reasonable eating periods. 
8029	In addition to comfort, working with a more flexible schedule also benefits students. 
8030	In high school, students are often faced with the dilemma of an overwhelming amount of tests, quizzes, or projects due on a single day. Working online with a more flexible schedule, allows a student to space out assignments as needed, improving the quality and ability to learn from each one. In addition to this, the student can also plan their learning around their personal life, and allows the student to create a schedule that does not force them to chose between an important test and seeing family that visits only once a year. The ability to have more flexibility is also scientifically proven to improve learning in scenarios at school where students are forced to sit for hours at a time. Scientists have shown that teens can only focus for hour long intervals with 30 minute breaks in between. At school, classes are, on average, one and a half hours with only seven minute breaks in between. This shows how much an online approach to schooling can greatly benefit students. 
8031	Not only can online learning provide much needed flexibility, but it also allows students to learn at their own pace. 
8032	"Some students are faster in some subjects then others, and even within subjects, students may struggle with different learning objectives. The freedom of learning online allows students to work at a pace that is comfortable for them. This by itself eliminates assignments such as ""busy work"" given to students that fully understand the material faster then others. This also allows students to fully understand the material before moving on, instead of rushing to keep up with a class that is moving to fast to allow a struggling student to keep up. Some students are very intelligent and work well in higher level classes, but simply need slightly more time to practice and understand concepts then others, which is a matter that online classes solve completely. "
8033	At every school, there is always a group of individuals that have no interest in being at school, and focus all of their efforts into disrupting the class. At home, you can not only rid yourself of these students who curse loudly, blast music throughout the halls and classrooms, and often start fights in the middle of class, but also other distractions such as the droning artificial lights and loud air conditioning. Schools have small budgets for large amounts of students and this causes the school to make financial choices that sacrifice quality school equipment, such as quieter air-conditioning and plumbing that doesnt shake the walls of surrounding classrooms every time someone needs to relieve themselves. 
8034	While some may say that giving a student these freedoms leaves them at greater risk for slacking off completely, 
8035	they dont take into consideration that once these downfalls of the school system have been fixed by online schooling, students can see and enjoy firsthand what learning the the right environment can be like. Students will want to learn. Students will want to experience the joy of knowledge. 
8036	Online schooling prevents all of the downfalls of the school system while highlighting the positive aspects, allowing students to greatly benefit. 
8037	Advice is an opinion, opinions have bias in them. Asking more that one person can help cut down that bias by adding other opinions in to a big pool making one bias less of a influence then what is was before you got more opinions, making your choice more accurate 
8038	When asking for advice, it's better to seek multiple opinions 
8039	you could view different perspectives, 
8040	you might receive better ideas, 
8041	you could learn from others opinions and could make better choices next time. 
8042	For example, if you were working on a project and you didn't seem like you were working fast, someone could give you advice that you could learn from to work more diligently. Another example could be when you were writing an essay but was struggling on your topic and got help from someone for an easier and better topic. 
8043	One example was when I was picking sides for a debate and already knew which side I wanted to go to. But luckily, I received a vast amount of reasons from classmates why the other side was better which changed my decision and helped me win the debate. Another example was when I went go-kart racing and kept losing because I thought my vehicle was terrible but it was actually how I was racing. Then, I got fed up and asked my dad what I was doing wrong and he gave me advice which helped me win the next race. My third example was when I was little and always thought that everything on the internet was true. I realized I was wrong when I was checking my facts and sources for an essay and was told that some of my facts were wrong because their sources were bias and untrustworthy. Lastly, I always viewed that my friend and I was the best duo in beach volleyball and that we'd be first in the nation. I thought this until the time of the tournament that would determine our rank in the nation and saw that there wer so many duos that were extremely good as well. We then ended up placing second in the nation although we were playing even better than we normally played. 
8044	For example, I was writing a paper for one of my classes and was struggling due to the topic of my subject. I went and asked my classmates for better topics and one of them had an amazing idea for my topic. I then used it for my essay and received an outstanding grade of one hundred out of one hundred. My second example was when my friend asked me for help on a project he was assigned and was struggling on. I told him an idea that could be great for his project which led to him receiving an A as his grade. My third example was when I needed to help to win a video game competition. I asked my friends and watched videos on great ways and strategies to win this competition and applied what I learned from them to the competition and won first place. Lastly, I was participating in a sports tournament and was doing terrible and asked my coach what I could do to improve. He gave me a few tips and points that I used to win and be the MVP of the tournament. 
8045	My first example was when I was trying to get work done quickly but didn't know what to do to become more efficient. But luckily, I remembered a time when I faced a similar problem and got help to learn how to work efficiently, so I took what I had learned and applied it to my current situation and worked very efficiently. My second example was when I was playing terrible in a sports tournament and kept fuming and paying even worse as the game progressed. My team took a time out and I remembered how to regain focus and lose your temper by breathing and and forgetting everything in the past. I took what I learned, used it to my advantage, and played exceptionally well for the rest of the tournament. My last example was when I was playing a video game with my friend and I kept losing to him. But thankfully, I recalled a time when I was watched a video on overcoming a situation like this and strategies to win and applied it so he couldn't beat me anymore. 
8046	You should always ask for advice and opinions of multiple people to view different perspectives and receive ideas that might be outstanding. Lastly you could learn from their decisions and better yourself for later situations. 
8047	When looking for advice on a decision, do you ask multiple people, or just one? Chances are that you ask many people in search of advice. You do this all the time, such as when you go to multiple doctors for different takes on your problem to help you to decide what action to take. 
8048	 When you take the time to get advice from others, you prevent yourself from making an impulsive decision. 
8049	Making a choice on impulse will rarely turn out well as you probably have very little knowledge and advice from others going behind it. It is when you step back and get advice from others that you prevent yourself from making these kinds of decisions. As an example, think about leaders in government. Often times they take a long time to make a decision as they hear from all of their advisers and take their time, as they do not want to make a impulsive choice. By forcing yourself to slow down and get advice form others, you are making better choices by having other's advice and making yourself think a little harder about what choice you are going to make. Getting advice does more than just slowing you down to make a better choice, it also allows others to make sure you are making one that will have serious consequences. 
8050	By getting advice from multiple people you can discover and understand repercussions of your actions that you might have taken and caused even more problems. 
8051	If you never took anybody else advice, you would have really no idea about what might happen as a result of your choice. Getting advice from other's on your problem would give you ideas about the consequences of the your choices, helping you to make a better decision. For example, let's say you have a dental problem where your front teeth don't have enough space to come out of your gum. You may go to a orthodontist who tells you that you would be fine if you just put braces on to give your teeth more space. Now let's say that you go to another orthodontist who tells you that just putting braces on may cause your back teeth to get bunched too close together, causing unnecessary pain. You just averted a crisis by simply getting advice from multiple people. By not being impulsive with your actions and getting advice form the people around you, you can make good decisions. 
8052	 You could also discover different options to take through getting other's advice. Seeking multiple opinions can help you to discover new choices that you never thought about 
8053	If you were to talk with one person, they may be able to give you a few different options, one, or none at all, but if you ask for advice from many people, you could learn of all sorts of different choices that you could make. By having more options, you have a better chance at being able to make the best decision for yourself. Going back to our dental example, let's say you go to another orthodontist, but this time he is an expert on your problem specifically. He tells you that you could get braces on only the teeth that need to move, or you could also have surgery to move the teeth to where they need to be instantly. Although, he tells you that the former would be easier and a bit cheaper, but both are immensely better options than your first two choices. By getting more options you are able to make much more informed decisions and have a easier time making the best decision for yourself and others.  
8054	By getting advice from others, you can make good decisions, as people can give you insights into your problem and help you to make the best choice. When you simply get advice from others, your ability to make the right decision is greatly increased, as you can find more options, understand the problem better, discover some of the repercussions your decision may have, and find out what others think the best action for you to take is. By discovering all of this, you can make an informed decision based on it, which will almost always be better than an impulsive decision that could have serious consequences. Getting advice from others will always be helpful in making the right choices. 
8055	Seeking multiple opinions on an issue helps people make the better choice in a situation in many ways. Hearing multiple people's stances in a situation helps make the solution clearer. Therefore helping someone make a better choice.  
8056	advice is more credible when given from multiple sources. If many people give you the same advice the odds of it being correct are greatly increased. 
8057	For instance, when someone has an issue and many trusted people believe in a solution, their opinions are almost certiainly the best option. In addition, it can help you find the better solution to have multiple people confirm that it is the best option in the situation. 
8058	multiple viewpoints can help you better solve the issue at hand. 
8059	Having input from both sides of a spectrum can help you find out what is better to do in a situation. In other words, a multitude of opinions can help you find a middleman of sorts to resolve the issue. Additionally, in some cases having multiple viewpoints can cause a realization that will please both sides. 
8060	multiple pieces of advice gives you the chance to have other advice in the case that one is wrong. 
8061	Before making a decision, if you are given bad advice you have the opportunity to hear other opinions and correct the mistake. It can also help if you are given a bad opinion and have other input to help you realize which is the best option. Plus, when given multiple opinions you will allways have other advice to fall back on just in case.  
8062	seeking multiple opinions on an issue can help you find the best choice in someones situation. It can confirm the best option or even help rule out the bad ones. Any way you put it, asking multiple people's opinions is way more likely to help someone make a better choice than just one person's opinion. 
8063	Knowledge is power. Without it there can be no inventors, innovators, leaders, or progression of society as a whole. This concept is the purpose of education, the transmission of knowledge. Educating the younger generations is a major aspect of modern society. It is crucial for the progression of the human race. However, like all things, education is constantly adjusting to new discoveries and technologies. Online classrooms are being offered as an alternative to physically attending classroom sessions. 
8064	Online education will benefit students much less than in class sessions by decreasing learning quality through ineffective education methods. 
8065	Lack of structure that comes with attending class from home will lead to an increase in procrastination among students which in turn will decrease their quality of learning. 
8066	Five day school weeks with consistent schedules provide students with some sort of structure to their education. Without a schedule assisting students with time management, they become accountable for their own learning. This is an issue because most adolescents don't have a passion for knowledge or simply do not know why they have to go to school which makes it difficult to invest their time into something they do not really want to do. For example, I am passionate about lacrosse. I am willing and able to invest consistent time and effort into improving my stick skills, strength, and endurance. With school, on the other hand, I find it difficult to invest the same amount of time and effort into a class or specific assignment I simply don't have that much interest in. It is not until I am forced to complete an assignment by a due date, or study for an upcoming assessment that I put in the effort necessary to succeed. However, with a structured number of hours that I must attend school each week, I am forced to absorb the knowledge required to eventually complete the work due in my classes. Most students who are not super passionate about school would much likelier not pay attention in an online class, or not even attend altogether. Online sessions will be ineffective on student participation, leading students to a lower quality of learning or even complete lack of education. It is completely dependent on the student's thirst for knowledge, which may not be that important to them. 
8067	For the students who find some importance in education, it will be difficult to engage in effective communication without physical interaction with the educator which may increase confusion and lower learning quality. 
8068	Student and teacher interactions in person can develop connections and a sense of trust that will help students better understand the concepts that specific teacher is teaching them. Online classrooms put a physical barrier between teachers and students which prevent any of these interactions. For example, my chemistry class does a flipped classroom, which is a teaching style where students are sent home to watch videos on the concepts of chemistry that we will later apply in class. I could wrap my head around some concepts, but some things just seemed unclear. When practicing writing out chemical reactions on my own, I had many questions that I needed to write out with my teacher in order to clarify. It was not until I came into class that I could sit down with my teacher and write out reactions with her that I fully grasped onto the concept. Similar to myself, it seems like most of my peers are hands on learners, where they understand concepts best when actually applying them and going through a process. This is an effective learning style consisting of developmental progression through the medium of a mentor, which in this case is the teacher. Online sessions lack this physical medium students can work with in order to fully understand concepts they are being taught, leading to ineffective education that will not benefit students. 
8069	Social interactions and collaboration with peers is a beneficial learning aspect that cannot be accessed at home. 
8070	The classroom provides a social setting for students to work with each other, ask each other questions, and create connections that one otherwise could not at home. Class with friends makes education just a little more enjoyable. It is the slightest incentive for students to come to school with a smile on their face. I absolutely despise the subject of Calculus, but it is a class a have with some good friends and a teacher that I trust and respect. One morning I strolled into the classroom without a care in the world, until I was greeted with a test on derivatives that completely slipped my mind and I did not study for. One of my friends was in the same boat, which provided some sort of comfort. Our other friend quickly tutored us as we panicked to prepare for the test. We bounced questions off each other in quick, effective communication and suddenly I felt comfortable and prepared. I took my time, thought critically and made my way through each problem. I remembered my friends familiar voice and it guided me to completion. She was the reason I had passed the test. Communication with peers I have bonded with helped me to understand a topic effectively and efficiently. This is a huge benefit to education that is impossible to take advantage of through a screen. 
8071	"From the time we were young children, like around the age of five, we were brought up that school was a necessity and that we had to go. Me, being a black girl and all,my parents always reminded me that my assessors fought for us to go to school: ""And you have no right not to go"". Up until 2017 all we ever knew was that public school is the only way you can get your education. Now, all that's changed, there's talk about distance learning; which is a way students can attend class from home by online courses, or video conferencing "
8072	"School is about educating yourself, so you can take on the great big world. When students decide to do distance learning, they take on the decision to learn everything themselves. Yes there are plenty of online videos and teachers you can watch in order to learn the information needed for testing, but who's to say that they're giving one-hundred percent correct information. There are literally whole human beings that will willingly teach over seventy-five students each day just for you're convenience. When I was younger my teachers used to score my writings with a three out of five or either a two out of five. That may not seem that bad, but from a girl who gets four out of five or five out of five on essays now, that's such an accomplishment. Of course I can't give myself all the credit because I know that it was my former teachers who built me to become the writer that I am now. Teachers literally made a writer out of a girl who couldn't even spell ""great"" correctly "
8073	Without teachers life is hard, and educating yourself will deprive you of the learning experiences like the ones that I encountered. 
8074	Having children to complete all assignments at home is very dangerous. Especially when they're left to test on their own. When left to test during distance learning there's nobody around to check whether you're actually learning the information or not. You could easily cheat on an at home test and not even know what you're being tested on. 
8075	Cheating is never good, we learned that in school, and it gets you nowhere in life. At home distance learning opens the idea that it's fine to cheat when no one is watching. Do we really want the people that will soon lead this country to think that it isn't a big deal to cheat? 
8076	Adult figures, parents more than likely, had always made it clear that school is for work and not to socialize with friends. Well, I know mine did. My mom used to always get upset when she'd get an email home stating that I, Generic_Name, was being very talkative in class today. Besides the point, school made me become a social butterfly and it opened me up to a whole world of new and inviting ideas. It literally made part of who I am today 
8077	Without socializing and interacting with other students at school I would've still been lost or undecided in what I would like to do for my future. 
8078	At first I was a shy little girl, but very talkative with only the people I knew personally. School taught me social skills at a very young age which allowed me to be comfortable around others, and it opened me up to be inviting to people I don't even know. See, children benefit off of public schools, but at home distance learning can't really benefit children in this area. Distance learning allows you to be by yourself, which isn't very good all the time. Too much time spent alone learning information by yourself can cause you to become a hermit, or even worse, it can cause you depression.  
8079	Some may say that distance learning is way more beneficial than public schools because you can learn at your own pace, you dont have to deal with any distractions, and it keeps you safe. While that may be true 
8080	distance learning can still cause major problems when you actually look at it. Home schooling, distance learning or whatever you want to call it is really allowing are kids to be lazy when it comes to learning. We are literally giving our kids a crutch right before our eyes and we don't even see it. 
8081	Asking multiple people for their opinions can improve your knowledge 
8082	people have gone through different experiences, 
8083	the elderly has lived through history, 
8084	even if people aren't there your peers post blogs and websites online. 
8085	When I was little, my mother told me a story her parents told her when she was my age. It started out with my grandma, Generic_Name, being about twelve years old and not knowing what to do. She needed advice. My grandmother decided her best option was to ask multiple people and see what they had to say. Initially, she decided she would talk to her mom, my great grandmother, and she told her a story about what she did and how it went well when she went through the same experience. Next she decided she would talk to her dad, he told her the same story that her mom told her but from his point of view since he never had to deal with it. Her next choice was to talk to her best friend, Generic_Name, but she had an awful time with this when it happened to her, yet Generic_Name still gave her advice. Generic_Name was thankful she had asked three people because she received three different outcomes. 
8086	"About two years ago my best friend, Generic_Name, called me and told me to come over as soon as I could. Not knowing what any of this was about, I rushed over there and she said she needed to talk. I listened while she told me this sad story about Generic_Name, her sixteen year old cousin, who was now pregnant. She continued to talk and asked me what I thought. I was speechless knowing that her cousin was thinking about getting an abortion. Generic_Name said that Generic_Name's parents and grandparents passed away in a car accident two months ago and Generic_Name was angry at the world so she went to a college party, had too much to drink, and met a guy. A month later, she found out she was pregnant and did not have anyone to talk to. She spent the next month looking up ""How to take care of a baby"", ""Abortion"", ""Teen Pregnancy"", and a lot of other things before she had talked to Generic_Name and asked for advice. Generic_Name had gotten some advice from blogs and websites online but she also wanted to talk to Generic_Name before she made a decision, but Generic_Name didn't know what to do, so she called me. The next week, we went to lunch with Generic_Name and had a long discussion. We didn't force her into or out of anything; although, we did give her our opinions. As we were leaving, Generic_Name mentioned that she was thankful that she looked up blogs and websites online and that she was able to talk to us. No matter how big or small the choice, someone is always there. "
8087	when you ask more than one person for advice it can better your understanding because people have had different outcomes with similar experiences, your elders are wiser and can be another option for giving advice, and if you do not have people to support you and give you advice, people in your community and around the world post websites and blogs online. Your peers, community, family, and friends are all there to support you and help give advice. No matter how big or small the decision is, someone is always there to help. Before making a life changing choice or decision ask multiple people for advice.          
8088	Why is the world the way it is? Is it this way because one person had one idea that the rest of the world followed or is it this way because multiple people have collaborated and asked for advice overtime? Throughout history many people have come together and shared ideas that have changed the world. For example, many scientists have invented things like the microscope and the space shuttle, and these inventions were created through a few people coming up with one idea and then asking for more opinions and advice from others. Because these incredible scientists worked together, we have these inventions in today's world. 
8089	Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better decision or plan 
8090	more points of view will be provided 
8091	less mistakes will be made. 
8092	Although people sharing ideas from different perspectives can sometimes lead to disputes and arguments, 
8093	most people asking for advice have open minds and are willing to listen to different thoughts. 
8094	People often overlook important details while creating an idea or making a choice, but when they ask for advice the people they ask can help them identify their flaw. For example, when people are planning a party they might forget to choose the kind of cake they are going to buy. When they ask a peer for advice their peer can point out their mistake, or the person planning the party will talk through their plan with the individual they asked for advice from and realize their flaw. Many mistakes will be avoided by people seeking for advice. 
8095	In order to make the best decisions possible, mankind must learn to ask for advice from others. Asking for advice can help change the world in a positive way because the decisions people make will most likely have a good outcome for the community around them. Seeking advice before making choices and plans is very important because mistakes can be avoided and different opinions can be heard.       
8096	Students benefit from the face to face interactions they receive from teachers and peers in school, as well as the guidance it provides them with as they slowly move into their adult lives. 
8097	Many students dislike school because of the unnecessary and excessive stress they say it creates, 
8098	Online schooling will not eliminate a students workload which is a main contributor when it comes to stressed out students, and while it may decrease their workload, once they enter college they may then not know how to manage their assignments properly. 
8099	Society also places high expectations on students to excel in grade school so they can get into top colleges and be set to live successful and fulfilling lives when they enter the work force. These expectations do not change for students who participate in online schooling so the pressure they feel to succeed is not lessened. High school juniors and seniors often feel overwhelmed by the rigorous journey that is college preparation which is why they are said to the most difficult years of grade school. Any individual planning to attend college must go through this draining process and manage the difficulties that come with it. Therefore, this stress is an inescapable part of school and is not exclusive to any one type of learning. 
8100	Although learning from the comfort of their own home may seem appealing to students, being educated through a screen is not as beneficial as the real life interactions that occur inside schools 
8101	When in school, students have the opportunity to socialize and create bonds with other students and teachers, however, when learning online they miss out on an essential part of growing up and developing social skills. Human beings are naturally social creatures and sitting at home in isolation most weekdays is not healthy. Online students may also have difficultly adjusting to college life as they must now transition from online lessons to in person classes. Public schooling provides students with the guidance they need to get into college as they have access to more resources than those who do not attend school. Public and private schooling prepares its students for real world interactions and teaches valuable lessons that adolescents who study online will miss out on. 
8102	Students need the structure and interactive environment that public schooling provides, as it is an essential part of their character development and prepares them for their adult lives. Although the stress of grade school can be hard to manage, especially as you become older, switching to online schooling will not eliminate it. It is better to learn how to manage it at a young age than to become overwhelmed with it later on in life. Overall, online schooling is not as beneficial to students as public schooling and those who participate in it may find themselves lacking certain skills they need to lead successful lives.              
8103	There is immense appeal to being able to spend the day at home and learn from the comforts of your living space while the alternative is being inside of a school building for seven long hours. Some schools have started to offer online classes or options for students to learn from the comfort of their homes. While this is not the traditional approach to schooling and learning, there are definitely a wide array of benefits which accompanying online learning for students 
8104	Further implementation of these online classes by schools would benefit students 
8105	due to the benefits for busy parents 
8106	an increased ability for students to learn and work at their own pace 
8107	accomodations for students to not fall behind or infect others while sick.  
8108	Children of certain ages and within certain family situations would benefit greatly from being able to learn from home and help their parents with household duties or other siblings. 
8109	In lower income households or single parent households with young children, it can be incredibly taxing to work the appropriate hours to support the family while dealing with watching young children, especially if childcare is too expensive. With online schooling options, older siblings would be able to stay at home, get an education, and relieve the pressures upon their parent or parents through watching their younger siblings. Chores could be done throughout the day and errands could be run; more freedom throughout the day would enable teenagers to best allocate their time to maximize it to their own benefit as well as their family's benefit. 
8110	However, some children from low income households depend on the school to provide meals for the children, so not physically attending school could have some serious detriment depending on the particular living situation of the child. 
8111	Additionally, the implementation of online classes would enable children to work at their own pace and consequently maximize their own learning. 
8112	In a system which would allow for the child to budget their own time from the comfort of their own home on schoolwork would enable the child put in the appropriate time which they need rather than spending too little or too much time on a particular subject or assignment. With the online classes only being an option, there are certainly teachers from the school which would be available to provide the necessary supplemental support. Also, the online classes could serve as an outside supplement to in class learning. Extra resources available to students with such great detail as being an entire online course would be invaluable as a supplement to what a teacher could provide in the classroom. Virtual learning could also provide a connection for a more individualized approach. Everyone learns differently, so creating an online course tailored to specific individuals or with particular goals in mind would greatly benefit this group of stragglers within the student population. 
8113	Online schooling would certainly work best for some students, but it would be more detrimental for the learning of others due to the diversity in the ways in which we learn.  
8114	Most significantly, the implementation of online classes would enable children to continue learning while sick and to not fall behind in their classes. 
8115	Attending school while sick is something which schools attempt to prevent and discourage, but the pressure to do well in school and the great workload make it close to impossible to miss school days without that greatly impacting your grade. In turn, the negative impact upon grades and having an insurmountable quantity of work to make up leads to a great amount of stress and anxiety. Making the decision to attend school while sick to avoid the stress of making up the work might lead to others getting sick from the exposure. Some students have physical health or mental health crises where the student may miss a consecutive week or more of school, and the recovery from that is a tremendous pain that might continue taxing a student mentally and physically. Making this accomodation for students physical health, mental health, and intellectual success should be an easy decision on the part of schools which begin considering online classes. 
8116	In today's modern age with widespread technology use pervading every aspect of our lives, the decision to offer online classes should come as an easy one in order to accomodate students and promote greater learning. By offering online class options, schools would be helping out an important group of parents, allowing students to pace themselves appropriately, and prevent absent students from falling behind in school. Considering this plethora of benefits which students would reap from taking online classes, it is well-worth the time to develop and offer these classes for the sake of the students who would benefit from such virtual schooling.  
8117	Getting advice from multiple people can be unnecessary or vital depending on how severe the issue is, and not a lot of people see the part where it's important to get advice from several different people. Many people just think that they should get advice from one person, or even just get advice from himself/herself. But both of those solutions to needing advice can be incorrect if the problem is big enough. 
8118	Sometimes, you need to have multiple people to help solve the puzzle. 
8119	there are opportunities to get help in other ways, 
8120	different solutions, 
8121	a chance to ask someone who has experience with the problem for advice. 
8122	"This can come in a few forms, depending on what the problem is and what is needed. It can be hands-on help with the issue, guidance to another person that can help more, or even as simple as some encouraging words, any of those can help solve a problem. For example, person one goes to person two and says, ""Can you give me some advice on how to fix a flat tire on my car?"" Then person two gives some advice. Person one asks for help with it because he/she didnt'd understand, person two declines. Person one goes to person three and asks the same questions, person 3 gives different advice, but person one still doesn't understand, so they go to person four, and person four offers to help person one. Person one and person four fix the flat tire, and that couldn't have been achieved if person one had just given up when he/she didn't understand person two's advice. Basically, getting advice from multiple can lead to someone just offering help. "
8123	"If someone were to ask one hundred different people what their favorite food is, they would probably get 100 different answers. This can be applied to advice because, if someone were to ask several different people for advice, they could get completely different advice from different people, and, chances are, some of the advice can really help instead of giving the person that needs advice useless information floating around. For a moment, imagine that it's time to vote for the President, and person 1 has no idea of who to vote for.  So person one goes back to his/her good friend person 2, then asks, ""Person two, who are you voting for?"" Person two replies with his/her chosen candidate, and person one asks several other people, and finally, person four tells person one about the candidate that he/she has chosen, and person one also votes for that person, because from what person four said, that person will do great things as President. If person one had just asked person two who to vote for, he/she never would've known that person four had chosen the candidate that was right for person one's beliefs. Another benefit to getting multiple people's solutions is that the different advice can be applied to the same problem until something works. For example, person one is trying to fix that pesky flat tire on his/her car, and then the advice that person two and person three gave. Because person one can't get person four to help, because person four is on vacation in Norway, person one decides to apply the advice of person two and person three to see if something works, and it turns out that person two had good advice once person one figured out what person two was trying to say. Basically, multiple answers can lead to the best answer and many solutions can be applied to the same problem until something works. "
8124	"This is beneficial because, of course, past experience with the problem can lead to better advice than advice from someone that has never faced the problem. For example, person one, once again, is having trouble with the cursed car, so person one goes to person two, person three, person four, person five, person six, and person seven. Person two, person three, and person five all give some advice that they found on the internet, person four offers to help but really doesn't know what he/she is doing. Person six just shrugs and says, ""I don't know what to do."" But person seven was a car mechanic for a few years, and person one didn't know that. So person seven not only gives advice that helps fix the car's current problem, he/she also fixes it to the point where it doesn't break down twice every week. The point is, if you go to multiple people for advice, chances are, you'll find someone with hands-on experience that can help you with the problem. "
8125	seeking advice from multiple people can be extremely useful for a multitude of problems. From fixing a car that can't seem to stay fixed to not knowing who to vote for, multiple people giving advice can help a lot. The President of the United States has the cabinet, which is a group of people dedicated to giving the president advice. So, if there's a big problem that needs to get solved and the advice of one person isn't working, try one more person, and if that doesn't work, one more, if that doesn't work, keep going until it does, because there's a high chance that someone can help with whatever the problem is, even if it isn't your inner circle of friends or colleagues, the advice that you need could be close by and you could never even realize it, it could be at multiple points nearby, and you could never even know that several people is what you're looking for. Sometimes, if there's a puzzle with missing pieces, you need to ask multiple people to help solve the puzzle, because they could have the missing pieces in their pockets. 
8126	Attending school practically takes up our entire day, and our entire lives. By the time we get up, get ready, travel to school, attend class, then come home to do additional homework, or entire day is gone. Additionally, we also spend five of the seven days of the week attending class, and those other two days of the weekend are overwhelmed with more homework. What about those who live far away? If they were at home, they would actually be able to get more work done as their commute time is absent. Where is their time allotted to spend time with family when your whole life is centered around school? Lastly, what about those who have a mental illness, that disables them to attend school for a whole day? 
8127	it would cut out commute time, allowing them to work more 
8128	would permit more time to do other activities like spending time with family, 
8129	would also benefit those who have chronic mental illnesses as these individuals struggle to spend eight hours a day physically at school. 
8130	For those who live a great distance away from a school, online classes would benefit them to a great extent. 
8131	The commute time takes up hours of there day, especially if they ride the bus. School is only eight hours a day, but including travel time, the act of going to school can take up ten or more hours of an individual's 24 hour time period. This permits them from being able to get all there homework done, and can also make them more tired since they must get up early to travel, and then stay up late since they get home much later. This results in an unfocused student, who hardly pays attention in class and additionally, a student who doesn't get as much work done. With online classes, the travel time is absent. This allows a student to learn and work more. The student would have more time in the day to spend quality time working. This would result in a more focused, determined individual. 
8132	When your entire day is centered around school- the traveling, class, and homework- students have little time to participate in activities they enjoy and spend time with family, which is crucial for mental stability. Teachers preach of having good grades, extracurriculars, and family time, but school is eliminating these options for the majority of students 
8133	With online courses, students can take their time working on school, but would also have time to spend with family and do extracurriculars. 
8134	This would result in a balanced lifestyle; a lifestyle that isn't overwhelmed with work. The balanced lifestyle would reflect in the student's learning ability, as they would now be more calm and focused to do their work. 
8135	When a student has depression, anxiety etc., they often find themselves unable to attend school for a full day, or even at all. Likewise, if they are present, they cannot focus and by the end of the school day, they are so mentally and physically exhausted that they cannot get their homework done. Their grades suffer as a result. With distance learning, they can work at their own pace, taking the necessary breaks when needed. The individuals would not be concerned with falling behind, because they would be able to do the work when they were mentally stable. Mental illnesses are just as serious as physical illnesses, and the act of physically going to school can be detrimental to their health, and to their grades. Online schooling would allow them to achieve a stable well-being, and a higher state of learning. 
8136	The act of physically going to school does not benefit everyone, therefore, online learning would be a beneficial option. Distance learning would still allow for those to achieve an education, but in a more peaceful environment. It would allow students to spend more time on their work since travel time is cut out, and would also permit those to have a balanced life as they spend time doing extracurriculars, being social, and spending time with family. It would greatly impact those with mental illnesses, as it would allow them to work when they are in a healthy mental state, and allow them to work at anytime. This would result in a higher level of knowledge, a more stable mental health, and better grades 
8137	Just by listening to different people's perspective you gain more information to help you find a reliable solution. For me, that is the correct choice because it makes more sense to absorb others advice to find a better choice 
8138	relationship advice, 
8139	how to take care of a pet, 
8140	what to do when you and your best friend get in a fight and you want to fix the problem but you do not know how. 
8141	you and your friend got in a really bad fight over the littlest thing like having the same dress. Now your friend will not talk to you because she had the dress first and then you got it. You may ask yourself what to do to fix this problem so you and your friend can be best friends. In your head you might want to get rid of the dress but you like it a lot. Now you go ask one of your other friends and they say just do not worry about it and find to go find a new friend to replace your best friend and you do not want to do that. So you decide to go ask your mother what should you do to stop the argument and she says to explain that you did not know she had the dress before you went to buy it. You decided to go with what your mother said and it works and now you have your best friend back! 
8142	Have you asked your mom or dad for advice with a relationship or with someone you like? You might think it is weird to talk about someone you like with your parents and that is okay. Since you think it is weird to talk to your parents you go ask your friends. Your best friend said to write a note and leave it on your crushes desk. Next you ask a person that you've known for a long time but you rarely ever talk to them, and they say to go up to that person and tell them. As you are on the way home from school you think how going up to that person might make you feel embarrassed and you do not want to be the laughing stock of the school so when you get home you ask your parents. Your parents tell you to think of a fun and clever way of doing it so they say to write whatever you want on a sticky note and put it on the persons locker. But you think to do what your best friend said and you write a note and you find out they like you back too. 
8143	when your parents said that you could never have a pet when you were a kid and now that you moved out you decide to get a puppy. You have planned this moment forever but you do not know what kind of dog you want to get. Say you were living in an apartment and the only breed of dog you cannot have is a Pit Bull but thats okay because you've always wanted a German Shepherd. So you find puppies for sale and go look at them and decide to buy one. But you did not do research and now you are lost and do not know what to do. You decide to ask your mom and she said to make sure you walk the puppy and make sure it gets enough exercise because it is a big dog. Then when you go get a check-up for the puppy you ask the vet and they say to make sure the puppy gets enough food, exercise, and water. Of course you go with what the vet said and now your puppy is the best looking dog in the whole apartment building. 
8144	In ancient times, and also still today in some places, leaders of countries, such as presidents, prime ministers, kings, queens, and even the pharaohs of achient Egypt have all had advisers that they would consult to be sure they were making the best decision for their people. But these leaders would almost never have only one adviser, but more often than not they would have several in order to make sure they were doing what was right. But why would some of these leaders insist that they speak to multiple trusted advisers before they made any important decisions? 
8145	seeking multiple opinions can help you feel better about your decision to know that other people agree with you, 
8146	getting multiple opinions will increase the probability of one of those opinions being right. 
8147	if the President thinks that this is the best time for their country to go to war, but they don't know if any of the people they rule over, or even the rest of the government, thinks the same way, it would almost certainly make the president feel less confident in their decision than if they knew what people thought about their decision, and they might not do as good a job running the country because they might stress about it. But if they consulted many advisers before making that vital decision, the advisers might agree with the president, resulting in the president feeling more confident with their decision and ultimately leading the country better than if they just went with what one person said and didn't ask multiple people for advice first. 
8148	"if I'm not sure what college I want to attend, and I ask one friend where I should go, they might say ""George Mason"" as a suggestion. But if George Mason is not in fact the best college for me, even though the person I asked was trying to help, that one opinion could sway me to go there anyway and not have the best experience. But yet if I go to ten people to advice, including the person who suggested George Mason, they might be the only one who would say that and maybe five of the other people I asked might say Virginia Tech, and I would decide to go to Virginia Tech instead of to George Mason, and I would overall be happier and maybe even get better grades. Then I would be more successful because I went to multiple people before I made a decision that could affect my entire life. So therefore even though one person still has a chance to give valid advice, it is safer to talk to multiple people because it increases the chances of making a bad decision.  "
8149	seeking multiple opinions before making a hard decision can be beneficial because of the reasons stated above. When I was in second grade, I passed the test to be admitted into the AAP (Advanced Academics Program) in my school. My best friend was also accepted, and wanted me to go to AAP with her, but I didnt really want to go into AAP. I told my parents this, and they agreed it would be best for me to stay in the normal class for on more year. Since I got my parents' opinions, I also felt more secure staying out of the advanced program even though my friend wanted me to do the opposite and go into the program. And so in third grade, I was not in AAP with my best friend, but nonetheless, I was happy and met many new friends in the normal class, some of whom are still my friends today. When I went into fourth grade, however, I decided that I wanted to go into the AAP program. Since I had already gotten in a year before, I was not required to retake the test and went in smoothly to the advanced program. In this example, I sought three opinions (my parents and my best friend) in order to make a decision, but if I had taken my friend's advice alone, I would have gone into AAP in third grade and not have been as happy as I was in the regular class. This shows clearly that 
8150	it is better to seek multiple opinions instead of just one. 
8151	The impact of asking people to help you make a decision can be big, like a country deciding to go to war, or small, like a third grader choosing if they want to go into the advanced program in school, but nonetheless, asking for other people's opinions instead of just one person's opinion can make a difference in someone's life, whether big or small. 
8152	there are many other reasons one might want to seek multiple opinions and pieces of advice instead of just one, but these are the two main ones that I think really make it worthwhile to ask for advice from multiple people instead of making decisions with only one piece of advice from one person. The key thing that all of these examples have shown is that it is better to seek multiple opinions from multiple different people than to only get advice from one. This is ultimately because asking multiple people for advice makes you feel better about the decisions you make and also increases the chances that one or more of the people you consulted with gave you the right advice at the right time to empower you do what is right for you (or perhaps what is right for the country you happen to be in charge of!).                                                                              
8153	People often get stuck in serious situations, where they have to make important decisions. They usually get advice from more than one person. 
8154	People may ask for advice from more than one person because, you can get more help 
8155	When you get advice from more than one person, you can find a great outcome in a much easier way. 
8156	"For example, "" I facetime my best friend and my cousin and say, "" I need help with finding something to wear to school tomorrow."" My cousin says I should wear a skirt because it's cute and very trendy, but my best friend said I should wear my new overalls because, it's cold outside and and they could be the new 2020 trend.  I took my time to compare the outcome and then i made my decision. "" When you want two different things you can ask others to help make the decision. "
8157	Another reason why it's good to get advice from more than one person is that you can look at the situation from another point of view. 
8158	For example, two of my friends see why the choice you're making is right and my other friends can see why it's wrong. I think to myself about how the point of view is different and which one I think can have the best outcome. You'll realize the differences in the outcome and make the best decision 
8159	Everyone makes millions of choices in his or her lifetime. While making these choices, it is not uncommon for one to ask others for advice. Often, one will consult multiple people. 
8160	It is always an excellent idea to receive multiple opinions when one is making an important choice or decision 
8161	this gives one an open mind to all methods and ideas, 
8162	lets one know what the most reliable choices are based on how many have suggested them 
8163	allowing the decision-maker to choose the best option for himself. 
8164	This can be evidenced by my own experience. One time, I had to decide what to get with money I had received for my birthday. I knew I wanted clothes, but I could not decide which kind. I believed it would always be practical to buy uniforms for school. However, my friends suggested I purchased clothing such as merchandise, sportswear, accessories, even things that were not clothes! All of these suggestions baffled me at first, but then i realized they were actually fantastic ideas! Ultimately, I decided to compare every suggestion I received and decide what to spend my money on based off of that. I realized that buying uniforms would be a bit of a waste and that I already had plenty, whereas there was a bit of a dearth when it came to clothes I actually enjoyed wearing. Without my friends, I never would have realized that! Ultimately, I ended up purchasing whatever clothes made me happy, such as those I found aesthetically pleasing and those that reminded me of things I enjoy. Despite thinking it was impractical at first, I am still very pleased with my choice and I never would have made it without the consultation I got from others. 
8165	For example, a few years ago, I needed to decide which middle school to attend. All of my friends were going to different schools, so i did not know what to do. I decided to look into the schools themselves rather than which ones my friends were attending. I looked for a school that met my personal standards and one that adults I know can tell me about. A lot of people told me that Generic_School was in my best interest and most closely fit the criteria I was looking for. They told me about the positives and negatives of it and compared it to other schools. It took me a while to make the decision, but I am glad I did. No school is perfect but I believe that this one was the best for me. This proves that recommendations are always good things to take into consideration when making an important decision. 
8166	An example of this is one that comes from my own experience. When deciding what to do this summer, I was given three options. I had to decide between traveling to West Virginia, traveling to Colorado, or staying here in Virginia and attending the Generic_School. My sister reminded me that going to West Virginia has not been pleasant for the two of us in the because never had anything to do. Then, my mom reminded me that going to Colorado means I will have to stay with my grandmother, who may try to convince me to call my father. Lastly, one of my friends suggested I attend Generic_School because I will have friends going there and I will be given the chance to improve my art. In the end, I decided I would like to travel to Colorado. Even with the possible downside, Colorado is my favorite place and I would be happy to return again, as I have not been there in years. The guidance from others helped me make my decision, but it was still up to me, and I am happy I was given the option to travel where I would like. 
8167	In conclusion, getting multiple opinions on decisions before making them is never a bad idea. The things I believe, such as that multiple opinions provide open-mindedness, multiple similar reccomendations can be reliable, and that listening to suggestions does not mean one needs to follow them, have made me believe that it is always practical to take other ideas into consideration and decide which option works best in whatever situation one is in.  
8168	you get a wider range of thoughts and points of view that will open up your mind to more ways of fixing this problem.  
8169	When you are provided with more than one or two opinions it leads you to being able to decifer the right from wrong and what your next move is. 
8170	"Sometimes you will receive an opinion that is totally different from the others. This is actually extremely helpful and would help you open up your mind and realize more ways to go about your issue. One other thing that may happen is someone may tell you something that is against what others have been telling you. For example if most people tell you to talk to a trusted adult, and then this one person says to only rely on your friends. Then you may realize that not everyone you talk to knows what they are saying. My final example is the chance that if people are talking to you as if what they say are facts, sometimes you may need to double check on that stuff. Receiving more than one opinion works somewhat like a fact checker and helps you realize if someone may be telling you false so called ""facts"". Being provided with multiple opinions not only allows you to open up your mind it will really show you the right advice from the wrong advice. With only one opinion you wouldn't be able to recognize these things as easily. "
8171	Having multiple advisors allows you to compare and contrast the advice you obtain 
8172	If it seems like there is repeats or everyone is saying the same thing, then go with that thing that is repeated. When the majority think that it is the best possible solution there's a good chance it actually is the best possible solution. Another thing that may happen is the advice may go back and forth and you are getting a lot of both sides or both opinions. Then in this case you can see which side has more experienced people giving you that opinion. For example lets say I am doing a school project and want to figure out how to organize it. Would I use my two younger siblings advice even though they have never done this type of school work, or would I take advice from my parents and older sibling who have experience. The answer is obvious, even though there are almost an even amount of people on both sides, you stick with who has experience. Finally my favorite way of using comparing and contrasting the advice. If you have a bunch of different opinions and none of them really match up or there are no patterns and repeats, you get to make it. In this case you can pick and pull parts from all the advice and build your own advice for yourself based off of other people's ideas. Being able to compare and contrast the advice you receive gives you a big advantage on how you want to deal with your issue. 
8173	You would receive more than one point of view by doing this and therefor a wider range of ideas. 
8174	This completely opens up your mind to may ways to go about this. You are no longer stuck to just your own point of view. This can also get you to act on your problem in a more creative way. This happens because when you are opened up to so many points of view it lets you be basically unrestricted in problem solving ideas. One other thing that goes along with this advantage is that you could lead to an invention. Inventions are just ways to get around a problem in life. When we receive multiple points of view like this is opens up our creativity and problem solving to a wider array of options. One of those options could be something totally new, which would be an invention. Receiving multiple points of view and a wider range of ideas is in my opinion the best part of getting advice from more than one person. That is because it can lead to so many good ways of fixing your problem and opening up your mind to realize new ways of solving your issue. 
8175	Getting advice from multiple people rather than one person proves to have a massive advantage. It leads you to a larger supply of opinions which help you narrow down your options. It allows you to compare your pieces of advice which leads to the best most specific way of dissolving your crisis. And last it provides with you with an open eye or a larger point of view on how you would like you fix this. In my opinion if you do not try to receive more than five versions of advice from others, then you are going about it the wrong way.          
8176	Everyone asks for help sometimes, but have you ever thought of asking more then one persons advice? 
8177	Asking more then one person helps you to make a better decision, 
8178	people have different thought processes and listening to the way others think can be beneficial for you when decision making. 
8179	Using the wisdom of more then one person will allow you to see things in a different way then you had before. 
8180	Before coming to a definite decision it is very helpful to have a complete understanding of both sides. This ensures that you pick the best possible choice. Advice can be great especially when you want to please everyone with the choice that you made. You should try to please everyone with your decision, but be sure you listen to everyone before choosing. 
8181	Take the time that you need to choose, the decision may be hard but you can make compromises. You take advantage of the fact that you can use others opinions for help, and not only use yours. What everybody has to say matters so listen to everyone's advice, then make a final decision based off of what you all want. 
8182	Using advice from multiple people also helps you to avoid bias. 
8183	If you had a very strong opinion on something, and you seek the advice of someone who thinks the opposite of you, you get a better understanding of why they think that way and can avoid bias. Some important choices cannot be made with any bias, for example if you owned a company and needed to pick employees to hire picking your niece who as no experience in the field, nor any desire to work at your company is not a good choice. However using advice from other workers who help run the company you could find someone to pick with more experience and with desire to work there. Bias in this case would not be good for your choice, so using others advice you can avoid it. 
8184	Using the advice of more then one person is a great help for you. It's something you should take advantage of so you make a good unbiased choice that is pleasing to everyone. Listen to people and take their advice to make the best decision you possibly can. 
8185	Today, we often depend on technology. From home to school to work, it is now an essential tool in our everyday lives. As the years go by, people are becoming more and more innovative in the ways they're using it. For instance, long distance learning is now being offered as a learning option for students. 
8186	Although technology has drastically improved since it first became popular, it is important to acknowledge the fact that there are still imperfections that can negatively impact students' school and personal life. 
8187	Internet crashes 
8188	hackers 
8189	lack of social skill 
8190	Many of us rely on technology without knowing the right procedure to take when it fails us. 
8191	Say a student decides to enroll in the long distance learning program. It started off great until one day his internet crashes. He tried everything that he could think of, but he can't seem to fix it. He has no choice but to call his internet company for help. He's then notified that they won't be able to come to his home and assist him for another 3 days. That's 3 days of lessons that he will miss. 
8192	Even when his internet is fixed, there's an high chance that he'll get hacked. 
8193	There are over 300 million hack attempts a day! His identity and personal information, like his address, could be stolen and he could potentially be put in danger. On the other hand, schools usually have professional staff that specializes in computers and technology during all school hours. At school, getting hacked and internet crashes will less likely happen and if they do, they have the staff to fix it. You may think that going to the library or going to a friend's house is a perfect solution, but there is no guarantee they'll be available every time you have a technical difficulty. 
8194	Social skills are critical when it comes to school, careers, and everyday life. 
8195	Being able to socialize comfortably and confidently is an important skill for success, especially if your career choice requires you to do so. People usually start building their social skills when they first start school, where they interact and communicate with their peers. Students miss out on this opportunity when they only learn by clicking and scrolling on a screen in the vicinity of their home. People often get comfortable with isolation and adapt to being alone and never learn how to communicate properly with others. Lacking these skills can effect the long distance learners' performance at job interviews and daily tasks that requires them to speak to others around them. This could result in them missing out on the opportunity to flourish in the career field they studied hard for and the opportunity to develop good relationships with other people. 
8196	With social skills, resources, and good relationships, students are more likely to achieve their goals. Being without these things, long distance learning students are set behind for the outside world. Therefore, all students should attend school the traditional way to obtain all the benefits and opportunities to be as successful as they can.  
8197	they can get different perspectives, 
8198	receive help from people who are highly experienced, 
8199	be given the chance to have a brighter future. 
8200	People can listen to others' point of view, which may make it easier for them to decide what decision they're going to make. For example, a month ago, I was in the process of selecting my courses for freshman year, but I was unsure if I should take regular Geometry or Geometry Honors. So, I found a time to meet with my guidance counselor and asked her for her personal opinion. She believed that it would be a mistake if I took the honor class because she was afraid that I would be overwhelmed with the workload. After some thinking, I decided to ask for advice from my math teacher, who encouraged me to enroll in Geometry Honors because she'd noticed that I've consistently maintained outstanding grades since the beginning of the school year. Finally, after listening to both sides, I decided to take Geometry Honors. 
8201	Receiving help from professionals doesn't necessarily mean that they know what's best for someone, but they can certainly serve as assistance if someone is facing a problem. For instance, a couple of months ago, my friend Generic_Name was struggling with drafting her college resume. She was at a disadvantage because she didn't know what steps to follow to write her resume, and the worst part of it all was that her school guidance counselor was unwilling to take the time to help her. At first, she attempted to write it herself without any guidance, but then her old friend, Generic_Name, who already graduated from college and is now an English professor at Generic_School, was visiting during that week. He noticed how frustrated she was with her essay, and decided to sit down with her and give her some pointers. After finalizing her resume to the best of her ability, Generic_Name decided to make a copy of it to give to her English teacher, Ms. Generic_Name, who is a notable alum from Harvard University. Ms. Generic_Name gave her some feedback, but overall, her paper was ready to submit. Generic_Name sent it out to Santa Monica University, and received her acceptance letter a few months later. 
8202	By making just one decision, your life can turn upside down. For example, my close friend, Generic_Name, just graduated from CalTech with his Bachelors and Masters Degree in cyber security and software development. He's thinking of applying to Microsoft to be an engineering coordinator, but he's unsure if he will be accepted. He knows that hundreds of thousands of candidates apply each year, but only a small number of people are accepted. Generic_Name decides to ask for advice from one of his friends, Generic_Name, who currently works at Microsoft. Generic_Name told him that with his work ethic, he would surely get fired during his first week of the job. Generic_Name wasn't sure if this was constructive criticism, or if Generic_Name was jealous of him and wanted to see him fail. Generic_Name thought about it, and decided to ask his college professor, Mr. Generic_Name, what he thinks he should do. He told him that he would thrive working at Microsoft and he would regret it if he didn't apply. After much consideration, he decided to apply. Five months later, he received his acceptance letter in the mail and happily took the job. He is now well known throughout the country. If someone is given the chance to do something great, they shouldn't turn it down. 
8203	seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because they can listen to others' point of view, get help from trained professionals, and can be given the opportunity to have a successful future. People should take initiative to ask for help and shouldn't rely on only one person's opinion.  
8204	"""Why should I ask another person for advice?"", ""Do I really need someone else opinion?"" are all questions you may be asking when you are about to make a decide on whether you want to consult someone else in your final decision. People tend to hesitate before asking someone to help them because they are not sure if they want another persons view that is contrary to theirs. "
8205	Having multiple people adding and sharing knowledge is a good idea if you want to make the most educated choice. It is crucial to consult more than one person for their opinion or advice about something when you are looking for the best choice you could possibly make .  
8206	By asking multiple people for advice or an opinion you will receive helpful bits of information along the way 
8207	Each person comes from a different background, they all have their own knowledge and ideas. Consulting different people will lead to tons of information on whether you are making the best choice. One example is that publishers make authors send their books to professional editors, editors advise the authors to add some of their ideas and fix any mistakes that are shown. This goes to show that having another person that will give helpful bits of information will help make a much better decision.  
8208	Talking to more people and consulting with them for advice or an opinion leads to more ideas 
8209	Based on what the other person says you can always make a decision on whether to input their ideas into yours or if you want to disregard their idea. For example when a student is about to hand in an assignment they always have someone peer review/edit to add ideas or tell them what they think needs to be fixed. Most students do this because they want to have someone else view and improve on their work. By inputting the other persons opinions and using the advice that was given the student will turn in the better version of the assignment than what the student was about to turn in beforehand. 
8210	When you ask another person for advice or an opinion you get a new outlook and perspective each time 
8211	Each person views something differently. Having multiple view points is important if you want to see how each person inter prates what you are saying, and see whether you like the way they see it, or if you want to change it to be perceived in a different way. Something doctors do is they refer you to another doctor to get a second opinion. They do this because the other doctors may catch something that the original doctor did not catch the first time. This example goes to show that everyone has a different outlook on things and see things that some people may not see. 
8212	"It is crucial to consult more than one person for their opinion or advice about something when you are looking for the best choice you could possibly make. By asking them for their advice or opinion you will get a different perspective on your choice, you will also receive tons of ideas and information to help make a good decision. Having more people consult on a decision helps the person making the final decision narrow down and decide what choice they should make. Like people say ""Two minds are better than one!"". "
8213	How many opinions do you need before you can make a decision? Well, I know that for me personally I ask many people their opinions about my situation and about what actions I should take before my final decision is made. That's just how most people are, they ask many people, they get many opinions, and then they decide which they think is best. However, most people probably don't know why they seek multiple opinions instead of just asking one person. So today I'm going to tell you why you shouldn't just ask one person's opinion because it's so much better to get multiple opinions from multiple different people. 
8214	Asking many people for opinions can help you make better decisions 
8215	it allows you to see the situation from many different viewpoints, 
8216	it helps you find out what the majority of people think, 
8217	it gives you the opportunity to deliberate what option is your best course of action based off many more than your own reasons. 
8218	"When you just ask one person for their opinion on your situation, they might agree with you. But, you know what happens when you just ask one person and they agree with you; you go with your ""gut feeling"" and if you do that then there was no point in asking for an opinion in the first place. However, if you ask multiple people for their opinions then you get many different perspectives, so you can see the situation through the eyes of the person you're fighting with, or running a business with, or having a baby with, etc. That way you can make the better choice because you can now see from the other person's view and understand why they are arguing against you. "
8219	I often have trouble making decisions about anything, I could be asked what I want for lunch and an hour later I still wouldn't have decided what I want for lunch. For example, I didn't used to eat breakfast at McDonalds, but one day I was hungry and I couldn't decide on what I wanted for breakfast, so I called a few people and asked for a few opinions about Sausage Mcgriddles. Some people said they were terrible, so terrible in fact they would be comparable to eating dirt; however, many more people said that Sausage Mcgriddles were delicious, they said that biting into a Sausage Mcgriddle was like biting into a world of pancake, syrup, and sausage heaven; they said it was a whole breakfast in one sandwich. So, now that I had seen from both viewpoints of the situation I made the choice of eating a Sausage Mcgriddle; and in my opinion it was the best choice I could've made. 
8220	"To most people that sounds like a bad thing; most people hear throughout their lives the words ""quality over quantity"". Often times, this is true, especially when it comes to consumer goods. But, if the statement ""quality over quantity"" was always true, why is it not used on everything? Well, when it comes to opinions quality is only determined by your opinion of the opinion. That's why presidential elections use quantity not quality because opinions don't have an official quality. The same is applied to any survey or poll that exists, they all are based on the numbers. So, if the president, the leader of the country, is elected by numbers, why shouldn't you have your own little election when you are faced with a difficult decision and you can't decide what choice is better? "
8221	When people face difficult decisions and they a few choices they often try to come up with their own reasons as to why they should choose any one choice. Unfortunately, people, like myself, aren't the greatest at coming up with their own reasons. So, when you ask multiple people their opinions, you can base your choice on more than just your own, most likely self-centered, reasons. But, if you only ask one person then you're only going to get a few reasons that are based on one opinion and when you can't come up with reasons yourself a few reasons and one opinion isn't helpful. 
8222	At last, you've, hopefully, learned and realized why you shouldn't bother thinking about just asking one person for their opinion. You should ask multiple because with just one opinion you can't do anything. If you just ask one person you only get one opinion, and with one opinion you certainly can't find the majority because it's only one opinion. When you ask multiple people their opinions you can find the majority, if you don't want to go with the majority you can use the opinions to look at the situation from a different perspective, and if you don't want to do that just list all the reasons the people had behind their opinions and then decide, in your opinion, which reasons are good, logical reasons and what course of action do they support. 
8223	Have you ever needed to make a difficult decision in your life? Many people have, whether that person is a small toddler deciding if he wants vanilla or chocolate ice cream, or a teenager in high-school deciding on the college he wishes to attend. 
8224	You can learn how to make the better choice suitable for you when you talk to other people with more experience and wisdom than yourself. 
8225	more people can give their own ideas and inputs into the said situation, and be able to help you look at the decision to be made in many different ways and perspectives. 
8226	asking many people what they would do in the same scenario might tell you there might be a clear majority leaning towards one side of the choice. 
8227	When come across a difficult decision that you may not have experienced and went through before, there is a high probability that there are other people who have been in the same place. These people will be able to offer their own experience in this decision, the decision they eventually made, and the conclusion they had arrived to. For example, a toddler choosing between ice cream could ask others what ice cream flavor they prefer, and choose the ice cream the majority of people seemed to like. Meanwhile, a teenager deciding on a college could ask adults who have recently graduated from the schools he is choosing between, and question them about their own first-hand experiences in that college. 
8228	While trying to make a difficult decision, your point of view of the problem can be limited as you are only one person. However, after asking more people for their own ideas and inputs into the situation, you will be able to look at the decision in a more broader view, and also how it can be made in many different ways. After asking other people what they think about the decision, they will be able to give you their own ideas and thoughts that they have, and the different pros and cons that come along with it. In each difficult decision, one of the elements that make the decision so difficult is the many pros and cons that correspond to each side of the decision. The decision is then comparing which side has the better pros and the least cons. Talking to other people might enable them to see the problem in a different way that you might see it, which can add to your list containing the pros and cons of each side of the decision. 
8229	Making this choice would make one feel more better and confident in one's self, knowing that there are many other people who agree with making that specific choice. However, if one wishes to use this strategy, they must also make sure that they are asking people who have experience and past knowledge in the decision to be made. A high-schooler who is deciding between two colleges and wishes to ask others on the college he should attend should not ask random strangers walking down the street. Instead, he should ask other gifted students, prestigious educators, or other intelligent adults who might know how to make a better decision than the student himself. However, even after receiving plentiful advice from others, one should know that you are still the person who should take all facts into consideration, and then make the final decision based on your thoughts and ideas. 
8230	when people ask for advice, talking to more than one person can help you make the better choice. You can learn how to make the better choice most suitable for yourself when you talk to people who may have more experience and wisdom than you, and more people will be able to give their own ideas and inputs into the situation to help you look at the decision to be made in many different ways and perspectives. Finally, asking many people what they would do in the same scenario tells you if there might be a clear majority leaning towards one choice. Having a clear majority lets you know that this is what most people would do in the same situation, which leads you to feeling more comfortable and confident after making that decision. Though many people have to make difficult decisions throughout their lives, asking more people for advice in this decision will lead them into making the right one for themselves. 
8231	Imagine living in a world where everybody thinks alike. A place where everybody has the same political views, the same views on relationships and even ice cream flavor.  A world that lacks different kinds of people with different mindsets is no world at all. Without unique mindsets to guide you through the highs, lows and small mysteries of life, we would all be at a roadblock. Weather you seek advice from outsiders often or do so once every blue moon, every person you ask will answer your question differently, with a unique thought process of their own 
8232	Seeking multiple opinions can guide someone to make a better choice in various ways 
8233	taking multiple opinions into consideration is beneficial to all of us. 
8234	Asking others simply for their input on a subject can deeply affect the way that you may view something. 
8235	"Outsiders viewpoints on a subject can change our perspectives drastically, opening our eyes to a new and different way of thinking. Every single one of us has had something in our past that affects our decision making process, weather its based on our experiences or how we were raised. It may be that you think through things with more caution, or don't think through things at all and thats why you are so spontaneous. I once asked a friend if I should get a necklace with pearls on it or a necklace with golden stars on it. She told me the one with stars on it because she enjoyed the way it looked on me. I then turned to my other friend who was known for thinking through things with a bit more caution and logical thinking. She started to ask me questions, ""What necklace would you get more use out of?"" ""Which necklace could you wear in all of the seasons?"" ""What necklace is the most similar to a necklace that you already have?"" With her advice I then realized that I owned necklaces that were similar to the stars at home and I would get much more use out of the pearls because they went with all of my outfits and were always classy. I would have had a necklace with golden stars on it, that I may have not gotten much use out of. However, with the input of another outside source I was able to eliminate that situation from happening. Though this is an example on a small scale with little actual effect or strong importance, the same thought process applies to something on a larger scale. With more viewpoints and opinions comes the idea of higher knowledge and with knowledge comes more implied power. "
8236	Realizing that everybody has unique and different viewpoints can be extremley beneficial to all of us. When we take advantage of many unique view points it helps us to make a better choice. Hearing the thoughts and opinions of others opens our eyes to ideas that we may not have previously taken into consideration, the viewpoints of others may even make us realize what someone else would do if they were in our position. Everybody has a past that affects and alters the way that they make everyday decisions or life changing decisions. However, with the help of multiple people's opinions, it can lead us down the pathway of a better decision. Next time you need help with picking the better choice, seek multiple people with different view points to really find the true right choice. 
8237	Nowadays online shopping has become more and more common, resulting in the majority of people to refer to the web when purchasing items. However, the items shown on websites may not always be parallel to what it is like in real life. Making a first-hand decision can often lead to something that is unwanted, not satisfactory, or a waste of money. 
8238	To prevent this, people should seek multiple opinions to help them make a better choice now and possibly in the future. 
8239	Most of the times the choices someone will make causes an effect on another thing. When a bad decision is made, this can lead to circumstances that someone would rather stay away from. For example, a person has spent money on something they wanted, but later realize it was bad quality and it was not what they expected it to be. This does not only put them in a place where they have something that is disliked, but now they have also wasted their time and money when that item was bought. Instead, that person should look up that item to see what other people had to say about it or ask peers who have purchased that item their thoughts on it 
8240	This will not only bring them to a choice that they will not regret, but it will also save them from wasting time and money. 
8241	The choices someone will make are usually decided on their point of view, meaning that their decision are based solely of what they think. When someone goes to multiple viewpoints, they can see the different perspectives on how people view things. This will lead them to be more open-minded on what they choose to do. Having a more open-mind can then lead to better choices and wisdom for the future. For example, if someone knows that a specific company provides low quality items, they can know that in the future they should not buy items from that company. 
8242	This means that what a person learns from making a good decision from others opinions now, can also help them make other better decisions in the future.  
8243	Instead, someone should always seeking multiple opinions to help with choosing what to do because it can insure that they make the best choice. When a person makes a right decision, this does not only give them a decision that they will not regret, but it will also save them from wasting time and money. Choosing the right thing to do now can also help them in the future when making decisions related to their past scenario. The decision someone makes might seem small on the outside, but truly when a good choice is made, this can change a persons life for the best. That is why making a right choice is important, and a person can only make the best decision when they have talked with more than one person.          
8244	Asking for advice from different people can help people make better choices. 
8245	Even if a person is faced with an easy decision like choosing an outfit, sometimes they might just want a little help deciding. It is always good to make the best decision possible and asking multiple people can help people make decisions. 
8246	Asking for advice from multiple people can give people different ways to resolve their problems 
8247	A shy person may have a different view than a super chatty person. For example, my friend skipped four questions in an english assignment; she hit submit on her computer and got four questions wrong because she did not see them. She could not talk to the teacher because she had a substitute that day. She asked two friends, one was a little shy and the other one was super chatty. The shy friend said to email her teacher telling her what my friend accidently did, the other friend said that she should wait until the teacher was back and talk to her in person. She did not think of emailing her teacher and explaining what happened. It is more likely she would have waited until her teacher was back and then not gotten full credit on her assignment. Talking to multiple people gave her a solution that she would not have thought to use and worked better better than her original idea.  
8248	Sometimes people need advice choosing between two solutions for their problems. If someone can't decide which is the better solution for their problem, asking multiple people can help. 
8249	An example of this would be when I got invited to two birthday parties on the same day that were almost the same time. One birthday party was for my friend who I had not seen in a little over a month, while while the other birthday party was for my cousin who I saw quite often, but I would feel bad missing his party. I asked three friends whether I should go to my cousin's or my friend's birthday party. Two of my friends said to go to my friend's birthday party and one of my friends said to go to my cousin's birthday party. I decided to go to my friend's birthday party because I hadn't seen her in a while and I missed her. I also decided I would take my cousin out to dinner to celebrate his birthday. I am very glad that I talked to my friends because they helped me make the best choice that was possible. 
8250	In conclusion, asking for advice from multiple people can help a person make the best choice possible. Whether it is an easy or a hard decision everyone needs advice at somepoint and asking more than one person can help decision making. If someone needs help deciding between two things, or thinking of a solution to their problem, asking multiple people can make their decision a little easier. With all the decisions people make in life, making every decision as easy as possible is the best thing people can do.   
8251	It's better to make a decision when you have multiple opinions 
8252	you can find new viewpoints, 
8253	have an outsiders opinion 
8254	you could discover relevant information about the topic that could persuade your decision. 
8255	When I make a decision I seek out others for their opinion. This has helped me with the decision making process and it can help you as well. Every single day you make decisions. These decisions effect your life. For example one time I had to choose between quitting lacrosse or quitting acting classes. I loved both activities and, it was hard to choose one or the other. So, I asked my mom and she gave me her opinion. This was very helpful because if I had made the decision on my own, I wouldn't have been able to find another viewpoint and the decision I made would've effected my life forever. The opinion my mom gave was to skip lacrosse practice one day a week for my acting classes. Acting was only one day a week and lacrosse was three days a week.  I liked this option. I wouldn't have discovered it if my mom hadn't given me her opinion. 
8256	Say your making a big decision. Maybe Its a personal one or one at school or work. The decisions we make today will effect others. Sometimes positively and sometimes negatively. If you have an outsiders opinion, most likely you will become more empathetic. In our brain we usually only think of our own opinion. Our viewpoint. But, there are two sides to every story. We often forget about our peers opinions when making a decision. Having an outsiders opinion can help you learn other peoples opinions and point of views on the situation and it can help you learn how your decision can effect others. Maybe their opinion can help ween you in a different direction. 
8257	The other day I was watching a movie. The movie was about a court case in which jurors had to decide if a man was innocent or guilty. The trial gave a lot of useful information that was used in the decision making but, as they went deeper into the mystery, more information was brought to the table. At first twelve out of the thirteen men thought that the man was guilty but as more and more information was discovered by the man one man who though he was innocent, slowly the other jurors who once thought the man was guilty thought he was innocent. At the end of the movie the man was in fact innocent. If that one juror hadn't brought new information that was relevant to the case, they probably would've given the man a improper accusation. This is a great example of how having many opinions can bring relevant information to a decision. 
8258	it's better to seek multiple opinions. 
8259	Some could say that it's not helpful because its your own decision and only you can make it 
8260	but, I think its better to have other opinions because you can find new view points, you can have a outsiders opinion and you can discover more useful information that is relevant to the topic. 
8261	People can be Indecisive, It could be a decision between going on vacation with your family or helping your friend with something they're struggling with, or some other really difficult decision. When this comes up, people normally ask for help, but how much help do you need, and who should you ask? 
8262	Let's go back to the decision between the vacation or helping your friend. You probably shouldn't ask for help from your family or the friend that you want to help, because the answers could likely be biased to one side or the other. 
8263	Now that you have a decent Idea of who to ask, how many people should you ask? Well you can ask as many as you want, but I would recommend at least four to five people you know you can trust 
8264	Deciding things can be very difficult, But If you were to ask a few trustworthy people, and know who to and not to ask without bias getting In the way, maybe It can be much easier to decide between the vacation with your family, or helping a friend out. 
8265	Schools are incorporating more and more technology into their educational systems, and soon they may become completely digital. Currently, some schools have been offering distance learning to students: a type of system where students can attend classes from home through a digital device. The classes would be done either online or through video conferencing. 
8266	all the class notes would be online and easily accessible. 
8267	By having distance learning as an option, many disabled and mentally ill students would be more comfortable.  
8268	As a person suffering from anxiety and ADHD, I find it very hard to be comfortable or adjust in a classroom setting. I can't initiate social interaction and oftentimes can't focus on what my teachers are saying. If I could take classes digitally, I could talk to other people by text, which is much easier to do than conversing in the same room. I would be able to pay attention to my teachers because it is from the comfort of my own home; additionally, I would have the option to re watch videos at my own pace should I miss anything. This will allow students who think slowly to be able to catch up with the rest of the class. Building on to that, some students are physically disabled and can't move to different places efficiently or safely. A student I know uses a big wheelchair, and another student I know always has to have medical equipment with him in case of an emergency. With distance learning, students will not have to travel to school every day. Thus, students with disabilities do not need to risk their health just to get an education. They will feel much safer learning and interacting from a secure and comfortable location. Thus, disabled and mentally ill students would be more comfortable if they could attend classes from home. 
8269	Having classes online or through video conferencing means that all the class notes would be online and very easy to access. 
8270	When making up work for an absent day, I have to physically seek out my teacher and ask him or her for the class material. Because of my anxiety, this simple action is much harder for me than for most other students. If all the notes and assignments were online, I wouldn't be stressed and could make up work more easily. It would save time for many other students as well, especially for those who are very busy and cannot afford the time to hunt down missing assignments. In addition, I and many other students have lost our notes and homework in the past. This has resulted in a poor grade or a failed test. By having all the notes and assignments we need be easily accessible, students would not be worried about losing papers or have to constantly carry a giant binder with them. If students could access all their notes and assignments, they would get better grades and perform better in class as well. The test score average would also increase because students have everything they need to study at their fingertips. If students attended classes online or through video conferencing, class notes would be very easy to access, which would help them get good grades in school. 
8271	 Because classes will take place on digital devices, it is possible for students to text or even call their teachers and classmates. If people have an issue with the fact that you cannot see the other person's face, there is always the possibility of video calling him or her. Communicating online is arguably just as good if not better than communicating face to face. Students who have difficulty interacting with other people have the option to simply text or email them, while students who have no problem socializing can call them. Letting students choose a communication method will allow them to be comfortable in their working environment and motivate them to try their best to learn.  
8272	If classes were taken digitally at home, it would be helpful for students because all the class notes would be easily accessible, and disabled and mentally ill students would be more comfortable. Students' academic performances would increase because they would feel more relaxed learning at home and wouldn't be worried about losing class material, since it is all digital. In the near future all the schools you attend may be taking place inside the comfort of your own home. 
8273	When you ask for a person's advice on a choice, you may hear a different answer than the last person you asked. That is because of their perspective of the choice. 
8274	When you hear a different perspective of a choice it tells you how the people may have experienced a problem related to yours. You can learn from those past experiences, figure out what went wrong and if nothing did go wrong, then see how you could make it better. It really helps when you know the background of most people's experience related to the topic. You can piece together the information, or write a list of the pros and cons of each perpective and combine all the pros. Finally, when you have your idea of all the perspectives you now know which choice you or others could most benefit from. The choice could now help benefit all kinds of people, since you understand the perspective of all people big and small. 
8275	Asking for multiple opinions is a probably the best way to find out how to choose the best choice because all opinions matter.  
8276	The choice you make can effect anyone in a negative way, although you may not be aware of it. That is why you should ask for an opinion(s) for it. You don't know what will happen when you make that choice and who it's going to effect. 
8277	Depending on what choice it is, it may effect people's daily lives. What most people don't like is change (especially if it doesn't benefit them). The choice you made could change the routine of the person's daily life, they may have more to do or his or her schedule could be way different than before. When you change something about a person, there could other people who depend on them to do something but they can't because of the choice you made. It could be a policeman or a firefighter that has his or her schedule changed, then somebody needs help but the policmen or firefighters aren't doing his or her job right now. Lastly, all of this makes you look like a careless human being. All humans judge based on a person's first impression, it wouldn't help if you ruined everyone's lives. It's like the butterfly effect, or like dominos. If you didn't care less about just asking one more person for his or her opinion, maybe this wouldn't have happened. 
8278	The choice you make can effect anyone in a positive way, because you were aware of everyone's opinions. That's why you should ask for an opinion(s) for the choices. You might know what will happen when you make that choice and who it's going to effect. 
8279	It's all in your control. Depending on what the choice is, it may effect people's daily lifes (in a positive way).` What people do like is changes that benefit them. The choice you made could change the routine of the person's daily life, they may have less to do on their time or maybe something that they are offered that could be nice. There is usually emergencies where someone need help from a fire or a robber, but you could prevent the disaster from happening. Finally, all of this makes you look like a caring human being. All humans would be grateful for the time that you have sacrificed for a beneficial choice to all, because you asked for multiple opinions, and you understood. This has all happened because you cared for others opinions. 
8280	In our society, where technology is constantly improving and the need for better education is always increasing, our country's demand for better schooling with the use of technology is exponentially growing. Online schooling has become more and more possible as well as necessary with the growing rates of both children in need of schooling as well as the demand for better school conditions. 
8281	Students that are confined to their home due to a number of possible reasons, often miss out on important lesson taught while they are away. For example, students in Generic_City, China have been confined to their home due to the Corona virus outbreak. Instead of loosing that valuable learning time, many schools have switched over to a digital learning format. Students can now continue attending lessons regardless of their location or health. Although this current setting in Wuhan is temporary, the use of online learning programs may inspire officials to make a more permanent change. As another example, at Generic_School, teacher's often post materials that were used in daily lessons to an online service. This is so that students who were unable to attend are able to stay current with the missed material. Although this isn't direct online learning, students are able to use some of the beneficial properties of what online learning would provide. 
8282	Online learning would provide a more preferable environment for learning, which in turn, will reduce stress and improve general moral. 
8283	For example, students residing in Generic_City are able to take online classes out of Generic_School. More importantly, their online classes often do not require in-person sessions, allowing students to complete assigned work at their own pace. Since there is no stress to complete work on a crunched time line, students can remain more stress free, and work at a pace more suited to their own learning pattern. In addition, students often prefer working at home, as they are surrounded in a more pleasing environment unlike typical school buildings that are often compared to prisons 
8284	. While working at home, student can relieve stress by taking a break or grabbing a snack, actions that are substantially harder to do within a school. Not only that, but students who have family members or pets can spend time with them as well to relieve stress. Overall, online learning will remove stressful situations, and help students properly address their school related mental health. 
8285	Within a typical school, students often are forced to work through distractions created by those who are less courteous to those around them. Similar to how a single cricket in the night can keep someone awake, a single disruptive student can keep an entire class from being productive. A disruptive student can prevent others from completing their required work in the allotted time. 
8286	With the implementation of online schooling, this entire problem could be avoided by removing the possibility of any disruptive students. 
8287	Another common distraction within schools are the growing amounts of students with cellular devices. Cell phone have become of the most common distractions in schools. Although online learning will not remove the cell phone distraction, it will encourage students to understand time management once they realize that the more time they spend on their phones, the less time they will have to complete their work. With online schooling, distractions will become less prominent and allow the student to deal with their own distractions. 
8288	While the current schooling system does serve a purpose, it does have its flaws. Many of which can be solve with the implementation of long distance learning programs. With the higher demand of schooling to those unable to attend public schools, as well as those unfit to attend whether by physical location or health, online learning is becoming more and more of a necessity. Students would heavily benefit from long distance learning programs because it would increase student attendance, improve the emotional well being of students, and reduce distractions that could prevent students from succeeding. 
8289	you will get a variety of opinions, 
8290	more knowledge about the topic you're making a decision on, 
8291	different perspectives of the situation.  
8292	Other people might think that you should deal with the situation a different way then what you were planning to do. this can open up your eyes to other options, you may decide that you like their suggestion better than what you had originally planned to do. Some people also might have already experienced the situation that you are dealing with, this will give you input from someone who has already been through the same situation, you can compare this with what you are dealing with. They would also be able to tell you how they handled the situation and how the people around them responded. From there you can use what they have told you about their experience and maybe do the same thing as they did. 
8293	Asking more than one person for advice can also help you make a better decision. 
8294	Some people might have a lot of knowledge about the topic you are making your decision on. for example lets say you are trying to decide where to go on your camping trip. The first person you talk to could have only gone camping once but the fifth could have been going camping for years. This person would know a lot about camping and all of the different camping sites; which ones are good and which ones are bad. If you had only talked to that one person than you could of picked a terrible camp site and had an awful overall experience but because you talked to more than one person you ended up getting more knowledge about campsites and had a terrific time camping. 
8295	looking to others for advice is a great idea, 
8296	It will give you a variety of opinions, more knowledge about the topic you're making a decision on, and different perspectives of the situation. Other people may have been in the situation that you are dealing with and you would never know that if you didn't reach out and ask for help.  You also may not have realized the impact some of the decisions you are making impact on others. Overall it will help you make a better decision and deciding what is right for you. 
8297	In our world today, technology has influenced the daily lives of millions. A rising debate is whether the majority of students should be able to take classes online. With technology at the tip of our hands, it can be possible for this idea to become a reality. However, the question remains if this idea of schooling is as effective as traditional public or private schooling. I think technology plays a big role in our education today. 
8298	While we should be able to use technology in everyday learning, I do not believe public education should be switched to online schooling 
8299	Though there are many factors that make online schooling acceptable, in-school learning is educationally a more effective and everlasting experience. 
8300	In-school education offers many advantages that are probably not available in an online education program. 
8301	For example, a student will not have a instructor to discuss certain problems they have with a topic. There may be a teacher designated to each class but they may not be accessible to explain one's questions. Whereas in school, a student can visit one of their teachers with a question and receive a one-on-one discussion that thoroughly explains a problem 
8302	Alongside to having an accessible teacher, learning in school with other students significantly contrasts to an at-home learning experience. As students attend school with peers and teachers, their value of education can increase because they are going to a place everyday where being positive and respectful is encouraged. These key factors that are found in a school is what influences a students' character and attitude towards their education. 
8303	One of the main characteristics of public schooling is how students are able to communicate with each other on a daily basis. In school, students are able to form friendships with their peers and bond with their teachers; these types of people in school could be what makes school exciting and something to look forward to for students. 
8304	This is one of the reasons students are inclined to come to school everyday. At least for me, one of the reasons why I enjoy attending school is because I get to see my friends. Due to homework and other extracurricular activities, school is the main place where I get to catch up with my friends; it is what makes going to school more interesting. Having friends at school can allow students to work together on the same assignments or school projects. Team based learning allows for all students to contribute to one task and work together in a way that will result in a good grade. 
8305	Skills such as teamwork and realtionship-building are key development skills that are primarily formed in a school-like environment. Going to school and interacting with fellow students and teachers builds confidence skills and speaking skills; some important traits that are needed for a career based world 
8306	Personally, I have become a different person over the years due to my experience at school. The way I interact with others has changed due to what I have learned from my friends and close mentors. I do not think I would be the same person today if I were to take online schooling. Going to school has shaped the way I view the world and my perspective on topics that may be controversial. Though there are other people in my life that affect my character, the majority of my time spent is based on school. Therefore I believe students can shape who they are by going to a school and interacting with new people everyday. Attending a school gives students the opportunity to express themselves and develop personal values. 
8307	Although in school learning provides a more effective learning experience than online schooling 
8308	It is said that with students' classes being online, it is more flexible to fit into their schedule and work around it easily. Another advantage of online schooling is that bullying is limited since the student is not always around other peers. I do believe that bullying is not permissible, but I think there are many resources for students to get help at school and deal with any situation. We have been doing traditional in-school education for so long. It would not make sense to all of a sudden switch to a completely virtual education system. 
8309	I do believe there should be an option to take some classes online, but one should not receive their whole education through technology. There needs to be hands-on activities present for students to participate in because thats where they can gain life-lasting skills. 
8310	Students attending a proper school is more beneficial and effective than students obtaining a virtual education. Although online schooling may be more flexible, in school learning is academically influential because there are so many different ways to learn in a physical learning environment. Teachers are able to get creative with their lessons and still provide the information students need to know. If students get too comfortable with taking their classes online, they may lose interest in, or overlook the importance of going to school. Virtual education should be available for certain classes or situations, but going to school gives students a meaningful and eventful education.    
8311	It is better to ask more people for advice than to just ask one person, 
8312	because someone can hear more points of view, 
8313	 it leads to more discussion, 
8314	the person with a problem can think about a decision or problem more. 
8315	This is good for the person who is asking advice, because the person can look at the problem in all different ways, and see which solution best fits their personal needs and goals. This is better because what makes sense to one person, might not make sense to another person. As they say, nobody knows someone better than them self, which applies to someones problems. Hearing different points of views will also allow someone to see which point of view is the most popular opinion, and they can make their decision based off of what most people agree on. 
8316	When there is a situation that needs a solution, the best way to find a solution is through discussion. When only one person is asked for advice, there will only be one discussion, and there will be only one point of view. When multiple people are asked, the person asking for advice will have a lot more discussion about the problem they're facing. When asking multiple people for advice, the person asking could also bring up previously heard points of view and see what everyone else thinks of that opinion. Once the person asking hears many opinions, and opinions on others' opinions, the discussion created will help them think more about the problem, and ultimately find the right decision. 
8317	If only one person is asked for advice, then there will be only one time where it is discussed. When multiple people are asked for advice, it will take up a longer amount of time, and will most likely be at different times and days. This is good because people can change their minds very quickly, and what someone thinks of their situation one day, might not be what they think of it the next day. When more people are asked for advice, all of the time it takes to ask them can be used to deliberate and decide which decision may be the best. When asking one person for advice, someone may only think of a solution to a problem over the course of one day. When asking multiple people, it could require someone to think of a solution for multiple days. This will make sure they think of all possible decisions and outcomes, so they don't make a spontaneous decision. 
8318	When asking for advice, it is better to ask multiple people than to just ask one person. This is because asking more than one person leads to hearing more points of view, having more discussion about a problem, and thinking about a problem for longer. Asking one person for advice will limit a decision and it may lead to someone making a bad decision. Asking multiple people for advice can lead somebody to become more open minded about a problem, or even life in general. For these many reasons, asking multiple people for advice is the best way to find a solution to a problem or situation. 
8319	"In an ever-transforming capitalist society, we still find ourselves longing to achieve the ""American Dream"", a dated concept that we are all competing amongst ourselves towards the desired outcome of eternal ""happiness"" ""prosperity"". Though these ideas are loosely defined, it is evident that this ideal is still widely present within our society; which explains partially why we strenuously embark on our own educational journeys despite having little interest in the information we are being presented. Some students prefer to make amends in their journey towards their  American Dream, opting for a ""distance education"" which allows students to learn via online instruction or video conferencing. "
8320	Although distance learning is sometimes regarded as a preferred alternative for many students who may struggle in a traditional K-12 setting 
8321	this form of education is restrictive in the sense that it has the potential to be diminishing towards the necessary social development needed for students to succeed in society. 
8322	While receiving an online education may offer a more comfortable environment for many students, 
8323	even offering a nuanced opportunity towards the development of valuable time management skills, typical in-school education provides critical social benefits that an isolated, online-based school environment would struggle to provide. 
8324	An example of this can be observed on a daily basis: with the simple accessibility of smart phones, it is now engraved in our culture that using technology to opt out of social situations is acceptable and more commonplace than ever before. This is because our long-term un-moderated exposure to technology and its tendency to distract us from meaningful relationships with the people around us, is used as an excuse to limit our own social development. As a technologically-dependent and ever-evolving 21st century society, it would be unrealistic to propose that we halt the development of new technology as a means to preserve basic human interaction. Because these social habits are nearly irreversible on a global scale, an isolated, 100% digitized school environment would only promote the social debilitation of today's adolescent student body. 
8325	"An in-school education strives to mimic the workplace environment. An example of this is the push for ""hands-on"" learning in the classroom as a response to criticism about lecture and textbook-style education for a more realistic alternative. "
8326	Hands-on learning has been notably successful across the K-12 community in ensuring that students are not only consuming the information they are receiving, but also applying them in practical situations. This is especially common in CTE courses, where students have the opportunity to operate machinery and complete manual work to prepare them for the demands of that corresponding career pathway. Online schooling, in contrast to a standard public education, fails to fulfill the psychological and tangible necessity for students to fully engage with their learning. Learning through a screen only addresses the consumption of material, while in-school education promotes the routine of a workplace, where employees are not only technologically skilled, but are required to perform manual work as well. 
8327	In-school education is necessary for all students in order to provide an effective education system that encourages the fair success of our future in a competitive capitalist society. On both a societal and individual level, an in-school education would entail lifelong social, personal, and monetary benefits that an online education would simply fail to provide long-term. Furthermore, proper socialization beyond core content is a necessity in education. 
8328	Would students benefit from taking online classes from home?  Modern technology has made tremendous leaps of growth in the past two decades, regarding accessibility to class work and instruction over the Internet. Within school systems, controversy has emerged over whether students would benefit from being able to attend school from home, through an online program or video-conference calls. 
8329	as well as compel the students to develop skills and traits to succeed.  
8330	High school students must wake up quite early in the morning (typically before dawn), prepare for school, and drive through several minutes of traffic to arrive early: just to sit in various classrooms for ninety minutes at a time, completing classwork and receiving additional homework. How much more convenient it would be for some students to wake up whenever their body indicates it is adequately rested, get a healthy meal for breakfast, and work at their own pace in the comfort of their home. Such a relaxed schedule would be beneficial, especially for senior students in high school. Throughout the year, their minds are focused on completing college applications, applying for financial aid, sending in SAT scores and college transcripts. Taking online courses from home would allow those students to attend to their other responsibilities and manage classwork at their own convenience. In addition, some students, unfortunately, get bullied in school by their classmates. Studying at home would allow victims of bullying to be in their safe haven, away from those who oppress them and ridicule them for being different. Often times, high school students worry that colleges would view their decision to take online classes as lazy or careless, however, I have heard that colleges value how challenging the class is, the effort put in, and how well-rounded the student is. Furthermore, enrolling in online courses would improve the mental and physical health of students. 
8331	Additionally, students would benefit form being able to attend school classes from home because it allows them to also prioritize their hobbies, passions and fulfill duties for the family. 
8332	In the novel,  Educated, by Tara Westover, Tara's family did not allow her to go to public schools that were endorsed by the government. Instead, Tara was home schooled, inconsistently, by her mother, through her middle school years; but she primarily worked with her brothers and father in a junkyard. Westover and her family lived a simple, somewhat poor lifestyle in the mountains of Utah. Some families suffer from the same burdens and need their children to work on the farm or in the shop with them. Rather than quitting school altogether, the children could take online courses to receive the education required to build a better life for themselves, while at the same time, helping their family.  In the same way, not only would online courses allow students to fulfill duties to the family, such as working, students can also prioritize their hobbies and ambitions;. For example, in this generation, common teenagers gain fame and fortune from becoming social media influencers. This requires them to travel for meet and greets with fans, have tours, always take pictures, make videos and advertise products. Additionally, some athletes are apart of extremely competitive travel teams that require them to travel often for tournaments and competitions. Such extracurricular activities should not be given up because it interferes with school. Those activities are the passions and hobbies of some individuals and online schooling would allow them to get their education and participate in events they love.  
8333	Lastly, online schooling would compel students to develop valuable traits and skills. 
8334	Taking online courses is different from physically going into school buildings because in the buildings, students sit at a desk and are instructed by a teacher, versus, online classes require communication via email or conference call. As a result of this, online students must develop initiative and independence. They cannot rely on constant reminders from teaches and classmates about when assignments are due, additionally, because they have the freedom to complete assignments at any time prior to the due date, they must have time management skills so not all tasks are left undone until the last minute. The students must also acquire mental and emotional strength, as they will always be studying alone in their homes without the comfort of their peers. When the students learn to acquire these traits, success in their online courses and beyond would be inevitable. 
8335	In conclusion, there are many benefits from being able to attend school classes from home through online school or video conference calls. Some examples include: reduced stress, ability to fulfill other responsibilities and prioritize hobbies, and finally, develop valuable skills that will assist with success in the online course and life after high school. Generic_School is very aware of the damage some students suffered from because they were compelled to attend school away from home, so they instituted the Hybrid Program and Virtual Generic_School, which allows the students to take either all their classes from the comfort of their home, or just a few so they take a few courses in the building and others at home. This gives the students the power to control their schedules and make their high school experience and academic load less stressful.            
8336	Needing help with a issue is a common problem that people often come across. Whether it is needing help with a relationship or just advice on what book to check out at the library, people often come to their peers and colleges for advice. Usually, people just come to one person for advice. Most this so that they can receive the most clean cut answer possible. However, this is not always the best option 
8337	When making a decision, having more information on all the possible solutions can allow for a more logical and precise solution. 
8338	The way most people collect this information is through other people. However, it is very common for people to listen to only one persons solution. They believe that you can get a more concise solution by doing this. Although this may be true, getting multiple solutions from multiple people gives you more information on the topic. One example for this would be receiving relationship advice from one friend verses multiple friends. On one side, asking one friend for help may result a good solution to the problem as it is more clear and simple and is not as complicated compared to receiving many different answers. On the other side however, getting one solution dose not allow for a compare and contrast of possible solutions through pros and cons, and does not give you all the information about the subject. This example shows that having one solution does not always allow for the best solution because most of the time you are not receiving all the information on the subject and arent able to compare and contrast solutions.  
8339	When asking for advice, unbiased opinions can result in a much better solutions. 
8340	"This is because when you receive biased opinions and advice, the information you are receiving is often not as factual and more from the heart of what the person you are asking believes. This is why when asking only one person, you are more likely to find someone who is very biased. On the other hand, when you ask more than one person for the same advice, the odds are higher that you come across someone who is unbiased, and has probably done some research on the topic. An example that would show this is voting for an elected official using one persons advice verses voting an elected official using multiple peoples advice. On one side, using one persons advice can result in a much more simpler reason to vote for a official. This also allows for a lot less stressful voting process as you do not have to compare different candidates. However, using multiple people means it is more likely that you will get more unbiased results. This also means that you can kind of figure out what the general ""popular vote"" is, or in other words, what the general majority of people are voting. This example shows that asking one person for a solution does not always allow for the best solution because most of the time, you are not receiving unbiased opinions unless you ask multiple people. "
8341	 Asking multiple people for advice allows for better made choices because they will have most of the information needed to make a decision, and asking multiple people will result in a higher probability to find someone that is unbiased. When trying to get the best choice for a solution asking multiple people can allow for your decision to be unbiased, informed, and the overall most common choice. Remember, the best choice can always be backed up by others. 
8342	When people look to others for advice, it is because they cannot think of what to do themselves or they don't trust themselves enough to make good decisions on their own. 
8343	Some people find it good to have an outsider's perspective, so they can see the situation from a different viewpoint 
8344	They also like to ask others what they would do in that situation, because everyone handles things differently 
8345	Occasionally people have gone through a similar situation, which often makes them knowledgeable on what to do. 
8346	There are many ways to handle situations, but when in need of help you should confide in others for the best advice on how to make a better decision. 
8347	In an argument people tend to be very blindsided and naive, because they always think they are in the right. However there are always two sides to every story, and other people can help you see both. Many times you don't understand what someone else might be going through and it is always good for someone to humble you every now and then to make you understand others. Whenever something is going wrong, it's necessary to understand it ask someone else what they think by viewing all sides or the problem. 
8348	The saying that other people show the best in you can be used when talking about giving advice, because people can show you new ways to see something or tell you something that you didnt know. Friends can show you the situation you are in from all different angles and not just the one you are stuck in. They can also tell you what they would do in your shoes, or how they would handle your position. Past experiences can change a persons perspective of their life so they don't make the same mistake twice, but they can also help others to not make the mistake at all. In conclusion, there are many ways others can help you for advice like sharing their past, saying what they would do, and showing you all perspectives. Everything talked about in this essay can help you come to your conclusion on what is best for you. 
8349	Do you think attending class online from home will benefit you and your studies? My sister took a class online that was required for her to graduate. She rushed through it and it was a huge waste of time. Therefore she didn't gain any knowledge. It would've been more beneficial if she took the class in school with a teacher in the same room as her with more instruction. 
8350	Attending a class online at home can prevent you 
8351	learning your social skills 
8352	participating with hands on work, 
8353	learning time management skills. 
8354	School is a very important part to peoples life. Not only the learning aspect is important, but also the social aspect. 
8355	You meet new people,not only in the beginning but also at the very end. You form relationships with others and get to make so many memories. I met my best friend in first grade and she is still my best friend. Her name is Generic_Name. She has introduced me to so many other people and has got me out of my comfort zone. My favorite part about the friendship is the memories we have made, the trust we gained, and the respect we have for each other. She has made me a better person and has opened up my eyes to be able to accept others no matter what they look like or how they feel on the inside. 
8356	I have made so many other friends through my Abby and we have such a strong bond with all of us its hard to break. I get so exited to wake up early and go to school just see my best friends, which always makes my day better. If I were to attend class online I wouldn't be the person I am today. 
8357	Participating with hands on work and instructions by a teacher is important to students learning abilities. 
8358	Their job as a teacher is to inform you about the information your presented with, and be able explain it to you the best way possible. Therefore, you can retain it and be able to apply it when it comes into play. I was in my 7th grade science class on a Monday. The week before I took a test on the biology of a spider. I didn't learn anything about it because I was sick and wasn't present in the class for the lesson and instruction given by my teacher. I missed a whole week and in the week my teacher gave out ways to help remember the information about the spiders life. I struggled so much on the test and didn't perform well. My teacher gave me the opportunity to retake it. I stayed after school and took notes while she presented me with details and ways to remember the steps of the spiders biology. That night I went home and re wrote my notes out until I can remember all the information she taught me. I took the test. Later, I found out I scored perfect on it. Im a visual learner and have to be present in class to be able to comprehend what I learn. I have to write everything down or drawl it out so my brain will be able to remember the information. If I don't remember the information on a specific test I have coming up, I can go back into my notes I wrote and re-write it out so I see the words again and again which helps my brain remember it better.  
8359	however it helps students find clarity in the information they are presented with, which they are required to learn and know it. Its harder to learn over a screen and be able to retain the information that is just presented to you without explanation. 
8360	 Being able to managing your time with school work now is a very important tool you will also need for later in life. 
8361	Being on top of your school work means being able to complete it and turning it in on time. My friend attended school online from 1st-8th grade. When she got to high school she didn't know how much time she should give her self to get all her work done. She struggled with it and ended up failing all her classes her first 2 years of high school. She was so distracted by other things while she was doing her work, likewise, she never completed the work that she needed to get done and ended up not turning the work in. The summer going into her junior year she was depressed but also was very stressed. She ended up committing suicide and it was very hard for me as well as a lot of people to comprehend. A lot of students have a hard time with this task because you have to plan it out and go step by step through the process, but also giving your self enough extra time just in case you dont get it done within that period of time. Its a hard task to map out due to peoples distractions happening internally or externally in their lives.  
8362	Its important for you to attend class in a school environment for you to get the best education. It can also help set you up to be successful, become the best person you can be, and to learn tools that can help you later in life. In the past, students haven't obtained much information while attending online class and puts them below average. That effects their life in a negative way and adds a lot of stress into their lives. Students could be more involved with work and enjoy school if they attended school on a regular. If we get ride of students attending online classes it will help students become a more out going person, learn the task that will help their life be more successful, and teach them the best way they learn.  
8363	Online Classes would be bad for students 
8364	it provides the student with more distractions, 
8365	they do not receive much hands-on experience or practice 
8366	it prevents them from getting the true school experience. 
8367	The first reason why students should not take online classes, is that it causes room for distractions. 
8368	In the modern world today, there are many things that could distract students such as electronics, pets, noises, etc. Imagine trying to work on a paper and all of a sudden the cat jumps up on the table and knocks over the diet cola that was sitting in a cup on the table; you would not only have to get up and clean the mess, but you would also have to move the cat elsewhere taking up precious time that could be spent working on an assignment. With online classes, everything is done at home. A student could be taking a test online and could hear just the tiniest noise and very easily get distracted. It is evident with the reasons I provided, why online classes provide such a high risk for distractions at home. 
8369	The second reason why students should not take online classes, is they are not receiving hands-on experience and practice. 
8370	If a student was answering a question where a picture was shown about dissecting on a test for her anatomy class and it was asking where one of the incisions should be cut she would not have been able to answer it due to the fact that the closest she had gotten to seeing a dissection, was by watching the video provided by her teacher. In classes such as math, it would be hard to teach the kids online when a subject such as that involves a lot of hands-on practice to fully understand the concepts. Because they are taking it online, there is no way for them to really get in contact with the teacher considering they may live many states away or even countries! How can you learn from your mistakes if you do not know what you are doing wrong and what you can do to fix it if you are unable to talk to the teacher about it in person. So it is logical, that online classes do not give students the ability to achieve to higher standards because they are not able to learn as well if they are not learning from their teacher in person. 
8371	The final reason that students should not take online classes, is that it prevents the ability to receive the true school experience 
8372	If a student decides they want to participate in something like the school's 4th annual tricycle race, then they will, but if they decide instead of participating they want to watch then they can do that too. Some people may say that school is all about making memories and trying new things, but that is not always the case, your memories are what you choose to make them. But with online classes, they prevent the ability for students to try new things, or socialize with friends. Socializing with friends plays a big factor in why online classes should not be allowed, because what if the only way of communicating with your friend was by going to school during a certain block; you would not be able to because you would be too busy at home taking your online classes to do so. Some people do not like to talk to others online because in their mind it is just harder to so, and it not only decreases your social skills but it also decreases your grammar skills too if you are always texting someone online instead of having a conversation with them in person. So with the information I provided, online classes take away the ability to experience or try something new at the student's school.  
8373	Online classes according to some people are good because they provide the chance for the student to go out into the real world and get a job, they provide the student less stress, and it provides the chance for the student to be more comfortable with their surroundings. Jobs provide students the opportunity to gain real life experience. Working at home provides less things to stress over and makes the student more comfortable with their surroundings and less likely to get sick because they are not being surrounded by all those germs. 
8374	But because students are provided with more distractions, do not receive much hands-on experience or practice, and are prevented from getting the true school experience that they deserve, they should not take online classes from home and instead proceed with taking regular classes at their local school.  
8375	Most of the advice that you will need it things like school or ideas.  You can even get advice on which classes to take next year or what sports you want to do or how you can convince your parents to let you do the sport that you want to do.  The best way to get better at sports is to seek advice from people who have played it for a long time.  Most sports like basketball or wrestling are just experience dominates.  In basketball if you are guarding someone with a lot of experience then it is going to be a lot harder because they already know the sport like the back of their hand.  It is always the best to seek advice from older players.  Because they have played the sport longer than you have and know how most people play.  The more advice that you seek from them the more answers you will get to your questions. 
8376	others can help a lot by giving you advice but you also always need to make sure that you are talking to the right people and make sure they are giving the best advice to you. 
8377	Asking for advice is always a great idea if you are stuck with a decision.  
8378	you also get way more support when asking multiple people because they all want to help out with the decisions you make 
8379	Distance learning has many benefits 
8380	such as for people living in rural areas where transportation can be an issue. 
8381	Distance learning students who have a hard time in social environments can find themselves excelling in the privacy of their home. 
8382	Less school days would be missed due to the fact that outside weather conditions and school conditions would not be an issue. 
8383	Also, less money would have to be poured into the transportation system and can be focused on other important aspects of the education system.  
8384	To start off, student's living in rural areas have a harder time getting to school and especially through a bus. 
8385	These student's have to wake up earlier than usual and miss out on more sleep. 
8386	The more sleep and time a student has to themselves, the more successful they will be. Imagine this, a student living in a rural countryside lives about 35 minutes away from his school. Their school starts at around 8:00 AM. The bus would have to make multiple stops and the student's being the first. This would mean that the student would have to be ready to leave in time for the bus to pick them up and endure the rest of the stops. Being this early they would have to be ready by about 7 AM or maybe even earlier. He or she would then have to wake up at a comfortable time maybe 6 AM or earlier. The day before they had homework which they didnt finish until about 5 PM. To get more than 8 hours of sleep at that point you would need to sleep before 10 PM. This leaves the student with not even 5 hours of the day for himself. More time could be allocated to extracurricular activities if the student did not have to worry about getting up in time for the bus. 
8387	Secondly, there are many student's who suffer from social anxiety and many other issues with social interaction. distance learning can make a student feel comfortable from learning in their own home. 
8388	Parents also have more control in a student's performance by being their to guide and support them through their studies. A student studying through distance learning will also be able to have more experience with technology. This added experience and knowledge will be critical in this advancing world. A lot of people will be able to find themselves taking heart to technology related fields or simply giving themselves new found passions. Students who otherwise despise going to school and having to deal with their ailment will find a new found love for school and learning. Take for example, a new high school student who suffers from social anxiety. This student would have to deal with tons of stress from entering a new environment with new people. He or she would be focused on the gratification of his peers while distracting him from his schoolwork. If this student was taking a distance learning program he would not have to force himself through this unnecessary stress. This student would pick up on vital learning abilities needed in high school to help him succeed in his upcoming years. Otherwise, without this type of program, the student could miss out on important opportunities through the stress and turmoil of worrying about his peers and image.  
8389	Also, a lot of school is missed due to bad road conditions or weather. Distance learning can help make sure that less days are missed so that students can stay on task. 
8390	Student's without power would have more issues to deal with that would also disrupt their learning, so it would only be logical that learning for that day should be halted. There are more scenarios where distance learning would help in these conditions rather than have no impact. For example, on a snowy day, roads are too dangerous for buses and drivers to come to school. With distance learning, students would have the ability to still experience a full school day without their learning be crippled by transportation. 
8391	Finally, less money would be spent on transportation and less stops would have to be made. 
8392	This could save student's more time in the mornings, and save the school money to enhance their learning experience. Buses would have less mileage and more gas. Student's who drive wouldn't have to worry about expenses towards their transportation. Also larger amounts of people can be accommodated by the school due to less people being physically in the classroom. More money could also mean raises to teachers which would satisfy the ongoing issue of teachers feeling like they aren't paid enough. Students will also be more enticed in a school career due to a larger salary. Schools will run a lot more smoothly and the field would be infinitely more respected by the new generation. 
8393	In conclusion, distance learning has a lot of benefits and brings forth solutions to modern problems. Students taking distance learning can better understand technology and how they feel about it. It would come to no surprise if we saw an increase of teachers and computer scientists due to the implementation of this program. School offices would be thrilled to use less money on transportation, and to see students enjoy their success without the turmoil of going through unwanted social interaction. Distance learning is an example of how technological evolution brings forth great changes to everyday life, and how we can get into a healthier mindset of change in the school system. 
8394	In America today many students are now doing online schooling. These students do school on their computers which requires an obtuse amount of reading. Students do their work online while often times attending video conferences. A handful of parents believe getting an education online is not giving their children what they need to get a full education. They believe there is nothing to gain from online school that you won't get from public school. But many disagree with that sentiment. Is public school really ultimately the best option for students? 
8395	Many americans currently struggle everyday with health problems. This can make things hard as resources are limited and some things might not be as accessible for some individuals. People with hypothyroidism often times have difficulty focusing. This can be especially difficult for students as a teacher may give directions and the student could easily miss them. Individuals who have hypothyroidism often times have what's nick named the thyroid stare. They space out and become unaware of their surroundings, including the teacher talking. Another symptom of hypothyroidism is confusion. Students could forget where things are and forget directions even when they hear them. 
8396	With online classes, directions are often written out or replayable. One could replay directions as much as they needed to without having a teacher get frustrated with them. This makes the problems that many who suffer from hypothyroidism face much more managable. 
8397	Not only can online school benefit people with hypothyroidism but also people struggling with ADHD. ADHD can effect someones ability to focus in a classroom setting. A student may get distracted and miss the directions a teacher is giving. A student may also end up missing important announcements. People with ADHD struggle to stay silent and sit still for long periods of time. They need some form of an outlet to let the energy they build up out. 
8398	Doing school work at home could give an individual with ADHD an outlet to let out energy by giving them breaks inbetween classes. A student could use the break to run outside or do a physical activity. Once they get back from taking a break they will be calmer and more focused. 
8399	Individuals who have disabilities that greatly impact their ability to move and walk could find that online schooling could make learning a lot easier for them. 
8400	If a person is Immobile, getting to school every day could be a great struggle. Most parents would want to do every thing to make it easier for them; one way to do that is with online schooling. You do not have to go anywhere to do online classes as you can do them all at home. If a person is particularly sensitive and stuck in the hospital 24/7, they could have a chance to do school through online classes. They too have a right to an education.  
8401	Students with mental health problems could improve their quality of education through online schooling. 
8402	Students with anxiety often have difficulty being in social situations. Anxiety varies person to person and for some individuals it can be worse than others. Some people have anxiety so severe it renders them unable to speak. A school environment, where most other students are constantly assuming everyone they meet can speak, could cause the student a great amount of stress. Transgender people often struggle with a lot of anxiety in school day to day. Many are too anxious to use the bathrooms at schools and hold it in for the whole day. Many are often also misgendered at school every day which induces a lot of stress for trans people, however, All of this added stress can be avoided with online school. There are no students to misgender trans students or to assume students are able to speak. Transgender Students can go to the bathroom at home without being stress. 
8403	One thing that effects teenagers today the most is depression. Depression effects an abundance of students on a day to day basis. For some individuals it can come and go but for some it can last longer. Some students have it for weeks and some for even longer. The people who suffer from it the longest are chronically depressed. Depression can make someone unable to get out of bed in the morning. It can make an individual see trying to get an education as pointless and make them stop caring about their future. 
8404	Being able to do school online can't fix everything for a student struggling with depression, but it can make things easier. 
8405	Need some help making an important choice or decision? When asking for advice it is always better to talk to more than one person. By only talking to one person you are limiting yourself from making the best choice/decision. When making an choice, decision, or trying something new it is best to talk to many different people for advice. 
8406	you can learn form their experiences, 
8407	their point of view. 
8408	People who are older than you have often been in your position before or have experienced something similar and can advise you on what they think is best for you and can help you make the best decision for yourself. You can learn from what they have to say and avoid any mistakes they may have made in the past. 
8409	You can also learn from others opinions. 
8410	Everyone has their own personal opinion, hearing multiple opinions from many different people can be great advice and something you can learn from when making a decision or choice. For example if someone had a bad experience at a restaurant their opinion on the restaurant is going to be way different than someone who had an amazing experience at that restaurant. There is no such thing as a right or wrong opinion, but you can always learn from what others have to say 
8411	There is always more than one side to every story. Seeing more than one point of view at a situation can help advise you toward making the best decision. One persons point of view may be way different from an others, meaning they may have had a totally different experience, and/or have many different opinions than another person 
8412	Seeing multiple point of views is better then just one, the more you know the better your final decision or choice will be. 
8413	When making an important decision or choice, it is best to get advice from more than one person because you can learn from their experience, opinions, and their point of view. This advice will help you towards making the best decision for yourself, and will set you up for success in the future. 
8414	School is a place where children go to learn and grow, not only intellectually, but also personally. I have many fond memories of creating long lasting relationships and discovering who I am as an individual. Most of this is due to the community aspect that school has. If I had been told that my education would be taught to me through the screen on a computer, 
8415	I would've missed out on a plethora of different and meaningful experiences 
8416	become socially inept, 
8417	may have never seen the person that I now strive to become. 
8418	These are all reasons why distance learning is not only a bad choice of education, but also that it can be harmful in the growth process of our youth. 
8419	Communication is a large part of life. Perhaps you are being interviewed for a new job, or maybe you're giving a lecture at a Socratic seminar. Whatever the reason may be, social communication is a very important skill to have; and while this skill may come easy to some, for us introverts it can be a rather daunting task. As a child I was very shy and tended to cling towards my mother at any social event I would attend in order to avoid the other children. My mother never forced me to, so I saw nothing wrong with staying by her side instead as it is what I was comfortable with. It wasn't until my first year of grade school that I would be pushed into interacting with others without the sight of my mother. I had spent so many years avoiding others that I found it very difficult to be social with other kids. By the time Middle School came however, I had gotten quite use to being around other children and could present myself properly in a social space. However other students did not have that luxury. As the sixth grade started, I was introduced the first home schooled child I had ever seen. Due to her being home schooled, she didn't spend much time with other kids her own age. Because of this, she often didn't relate well to others and could never pick up on normal social ques. As the years went on and she continued to be taught in public school, she did in fact become a lot more social and gained a group of very close friends, myself included, but the point still stands that if either of us had stayed to ourselves and had never been put into a social environment at that young age, then we would've never learned how to properly conduct ourselves in society. 
8420	Currently the world is becoming more technologically advanced and most careers have adapted this new wave of advancements. It can be said that the computer focused aspect of distance learning will better prepare students for jobs such as these. 
8421	However, what if a child doesn't want these careers and strive for something more personal to them and just don't know it yet? 
8422	Careers such as and artist or a musician. Skills that can't simply be taught through a screen and involve a more hands on approach. Schools not only provide but encourage all students to partake in a variety of different clubs and extracurricular activities in order for each student to discover their own passion. 
8423	Being exposed to things allow students to grow a fondness for them and venture out of their comfort zone; something that distance learning is not able to do. 
8424	Distance learning is a very wonderful concept when it comes to how we teach children. It allows student to be more comfortable and work by their own schedule for the most part. The fact that technology has become such a common aspect of life that children are able to be taught in this way is an achievement in itself. 
8425	We should not rely on technology for childrens' education due to the fact that it may be psychologically damaging for the youth. 
8426	We as a species are very passionate and thrive off of compassion. Studies have shown that this current generation is statistically the most depressed it has ever been. Connecting studies show that this is due to majority of millennials feeling lonely due to the inability to communicate properly with others. This is due to the over usage of technology to communicate rather than face to face interaction. Most people when asked when they have talked to others in person answer with either in school or in a place of business. We can't revert the effects technology has had on society but we can surely stop it from getting worse. Implementing distance learning would only cut off a form students from getting an already stagnant amount of social reaction that is needed. Thus leading us to an even more depressed society. 
8427	While in concept the idea of distance learning is great, through execution is where it fails. Distance learning causes much more harm than it does good by creating lost, socially inept individuals, along with furthering the growth of a future filled with depression. Schools simply offer more, allowing kids to find themselves and develop in a much more positive environment. 
8428	Would students benefit from being able to attend classes from home?  The American Education System has grown a lot since it was originally curated. While I do believe there have been positives to have come from today's educational system, I also believe there are improvements that can be made. One important improvement would be the ability to attend classes online. 
8429	First of all, this would be very beneficial because attending classes from home would help relieve stress from students with social anxieties or anxieties involving the typical school format. 
8430	The stress levels of students has grown exponentially in the passed couple of decades, and I've seen it first hand. Students are growing more and more anxious as the expectations to get good grades, get into a good school, and follow a career in STEM become higher. How are we to expect our students handle these sort of worries while also trying to balance a social life? My younger sister has aspired to be many things; including a doctor, a biologist, and even a detective. But do to her hyper-thyroidism she has been held back by her medical testings and re-diagnosis' during the school year. This has caused an immense amount of stress and anxiety--but after many meetings and emails between my parents and the school, she was accommodated with home bound. Home bound is a form of at-home schooling that allows her to take some classes from home and work with teachers outside of school hours in order to help her get caught up. 
8431	Second of all, attending classes from home would allow for more flexibility when it comes to the scheduling of classes, and potentially assignment deadlines. 
8432	If a student struggles to balance school, extra-curricular activities, and a job, they would probably find online classes to be very beneficial. When taking classes online, students are usually allowed for more freedom and flexibility. They can sleep in until noon, and then work on a class in the evening. Or if they work to help support their family, they can get up early, get their school work done, and work a job in the afternoon. Most online classes are scheduled similarly to college courses, and will allow students to plan when during the week they wish to take certain classes. My younger sister, who I spoke of earlier, has found this to be very beneficial, and something she will miss once she can fully reimmerse herself into a regular school schedule. 
8433	Some parents do not get a full scope of what is going on in a students school day, and it can sometimes be hard for kids to communicate this to their parents. Some parents tend to job the gun when they take a look at their grades and are seeing their kid isn't doing too well, but what they aren't always considering is the other factors that go into it. A students grade could be reflective of not only their work ethic and focus, but how well a teacher is teaching them, and the sort relationships between other kids in the class. If a parent is able to be present when a student is working on their courses, they would be able to get a full scope of how their student learns. Not only that, but the student would have less distractions from other kids, and hopefully be able to avoid some of the flaws of an individual teachers style of teaching. 
8434	"Now while I do believe others would combat my claim with statements such as, ""today's educational system has done amazing and has left many students with successful careers in medicine and engineering"". "
8435	But to that I would say; there have also been many successful people in history such as scientist, Albert Einstein and entrepreneur, Gary Vee, who either dropped out of high school or didn't find themselves doing so great until university. 
8436	all people have different backgrounds, 
8437	different experiences, 
8438	can provide new ways to think about something. 
8439	Many people grew up different ways, in different places, and with different people around them. This can impact the way people think about things. According to a study, 90% of people who grew up in poverty know how important getting a job and being able to provide for others is. They know the importance of this because they grew up without it. For example when I was at a beach and I was debating whether or not I should use my money on ice cream or a sand bucket so I went around asking people what I should purchase. I went up to a man who was not from America and asked him what I should get and he said that since he didnt have ice cream in his home country, I should get that. The man didnt have ice cream in his country so his background influenced his decision to tell me what i should get. 
8440	Everyone's experiences are different even if they did the same thing. This can influence what they tell you. A study has shown that people who have had fun doing something are more likely to give positive advice, and those who have not had a good experience are more likely to give negative advice. When someone has had not good experiences with something will probably not recommend you do that same thing where as if someone has had a good time doing something they might recommend it. For example when a friend of mine was preparing to go on vacation to Florida, he was wondering if he should take a plane or drive. Many people he asked said that when they had been on planes they were not pleased with the comfort ability of them and that he should drive. Others said that in their experiences of being on a plane where quite enjoyable and that driving would be very long and boring. Each person has a different experience and has different advice to give you. 
8441	Each person interprets everything you say differently and think about things differently. for example I was wondering if I should start writing an essay now or wait a little bit and brain storm. I asked my mom and dad what I should do and my mom said that I should think and do a little bit of it now, then later go back check it and do a little bit more. I didn't even think of doing that and it goes to show that asking multiple people can provide new ideas and ways of thinking. According to a philosopher if man gets caught up with work and close his mind to other ways of going about it, he will need someone else to open it for him. this explains that different opinions can help one open their mind to different things and make better decisions 
8442	getting advice from multiple people is beneficial because all people have different backgrounds, different experiences, and have different ways to think about things. Multiple opinions help you make a better choice because you can see what other people think about a certain thing. Getting multiple opinion can also help you a chance to think of something in a way that you didnt think about. If you ever need advice in the future, ask multiple people about it and make your decision from there. 
8443	"""Hey Generic_Name what do you think about this new video game?"" Generic_Name asked. ""Dont ask just me because then you might be getting a bad opinion from me!"" Generic_Name replied. ""Okay, I'll make sure to ask someone else as well to get their opinion, thanks Generic_Name!"" Generic_Name said "
8444	because you see the bigger picture 
8445	eliminate bias, 
8446	and you can make a better choice. 
8447	Firstly, asking for two opinions is good because you can see the bigger picture. 
8448	"""Hey Generic_Name should i get Space Defenders 4 or Battle for the Netherlands 2?"" Generic_Name asked. ""Is that even a question?"" Generic_Name replied, ""Get Space Defenders 4 man, the company for Battle for the Netherlands 2 is corrupted, they keep making the game more and more expensive!"" ""Whoa whoa whoa stop right there!"" Generic_Name interrupted, ""The makers of Battle for the Netherlands are making the game more expensive because they're getting lots of sales and want to make more profit! It's simple economics Generic_Name!"" ""Thanks Generic_Name! I'll take that into consideration when I'm deciding!"" Generic_Name replied. Seeing the bigger picture allows you to see where a company or person might be getting their reasoning from when they make what seems to be a bad decision. When taking that extra info into consideration it allows you to understand the consequences of taking the other choice that might be more risky. With school laptops and computers, it might seem ridiculous the schools are getting such slow computers, but in fact they get them early so that they can last a long time and save a lot of money on technology for the years to come. "
8449	Secondly, asking for two opinions is good because it helps you eliminate bias. 
8450	"""Hey Generic_Name do you think Fortnite or Minecraft is better?"" Generic_Name asked. ""Fortnite is way better than Minecraft dude,"" Generic_Name replied. ""Well I'm still going to ask Generic_Name what he thinks because you might have a biased opinion and you don't know it!"" Generic_Name answered. Biased opinions can seriously affect a companies sales, or a consumers choice, or even what materials are used to make the product in the first place! When using something that is biased, you get something that could be a much worse choice. Using non-biased opinions from friends and family is much more reliable than using a biased opinion since you are more likely to get a better product or service if you go based on facts, and not opinions. "
8451	Thirdly, asking for two opinions is good because you can make a better choice. 
8452	"""Generic_Name what do you think about Sauce Mixer 3? It has 200 reviews and they're all positive,"" Generic_Name asked. ""I think you should get it if its got mostly positive reviews"" Generic_Name replied, ""What do you think Generic_Name?"" ""Well I think you should get Cheese Factory Simulator, its got the same amount of reviews with 94% of them being positive, and it's $8 cheaper than Sauce Mixer 3!"" Generic_Name replied. Making a better choice can not only help you now, but it can also benefit you later when the price of the game might go up! Making a better choice can mean you have more of a certain resource to spare so you can donate extras to charity or some other organization. Not having that extra bit of money could mean you wouldn't have enough money to have nice food, or any food at all, until you have more money. "
8453	"""Hey Generic_Name?"" Generic_Name asked. ""Yeah Generic_Name?"" Generic_Name replied. ""Did you ever get that game?"" Generic_Name asked. ""Actually no I didn't, I was too afraid I was gonna make a bad choice!"" Generic_Name said. ""Well you're in luck! I just got an e-mail that the game is on sale for 20% off!"" Generic_Name answered. ""Oh cool! So now I can get this game and still feel good because I'll be saving money as well!"" Generic_Name said. In conclusion, Asking for two or more opinions is good because it helps you see the bigger picture, eliminate bias, and make a better choice. "
8454	due to mental illnesses preventing a person from attending, 
8455	and to give sick students the experience of attending school, as it is every person's given right to receive an education and nothing should prevent that in the modern world. 
8456	In the past, mentioning mental illness was seen as a sort of taboo in society and there was a stigma surrounding the idea of a mental illness and the idea of getting help for one. In today's day and age, however, many people openly suffer from some sort of incapacitating mental illness and are open about getting help for it due to the actions of a very progressive society 
8457	A lot of these people who suffer are students actively trying to seek an education but cannot because of their condition. If the opportunity were available for these students to receive an education while also catering to their specific condition, they would greatly benefit from it. For example, if a high school student was suffering from crippling social anxiety and clinical depression and could not attend school, the consequences of he/she not receiving an education would greatly outweigh the benefits of he/she staying home for their condition. Not giving the student the chance to receive their high school diploma through online classes is only setting he/she up for failure later in life with little job opportunities and an overall lesser quality of life. If the student were to attend online classes from home, however, their condition would not be triggered due to them being in the comfort of their home and not in a public space, which is a usual trigger for most people, and they would receive an education. Some could argue that providing online classes to students with mental illnesses will only fuel their condition and that it is catering to a budding sense of entitlement, but that is very inaccurate in almost all cases. To force a student that is clearly suffering to go to school is not only cruel, but it also makes the student feel as if they do not matter and that their feelings are invalid. Feelings of invalidity and anger caused by students being in a place they are miserable in is definitely a factor in rising rates of teenage suicide and depression, so to implement a program for online students would not only save lives, but definitely make the kids of the world happier. 
8458	Being able to attend classes online would greatly convenience thousands of students with little to no time 
8459	For example, college applications now require a multitude of skills and are looking for variety within the application pool which results in students scrambling to participate in a lot of extracurricular activities and taking a heavier course load to stand out. With these new additions come with a much more time consuming schedule and title to no time for the student to recuperate and recover from the day's events. If the student could take online classes and be permitted to arrive late or leave early to/from school, this would open a large time frame in which the student can do whatever they want. This extra time could be used to relax, be dedicated to homework, or even sleep for longer, really whatever the student wants to do with it. No matter what they do though, it is obvious that the opportunity to have a reduced schedule inside the school building would greatly benefit the student since it allows he/she to just feel like they have a choice in life, rather than dedicate very waking hour of his/her life to school. Speaking from personal experience, spending too much time dedicated to school can lead to a very quick burnout and feelings of exhaustion, both mentally and physically, which in turn causes my grades to suffer from school, ironically. 
8460	In light of recent events, online school is becoming a very sensible path for many schools in the near future. 
8461	When pandemics hit, it would be very foolish to continue to send students to school, which can very easily harbor super-spreaders of a virus. With online classes though, the spread of a virus can be halted if everyone were to attend school online which not only protects students but also the staff. For example, the increasingly dangerous threat of COVID-19 is affecting daily life everywhere. Since the epicenter of this virus is in China, a country with a very large world presence, fears of it spreading arose in the other eastern areas like South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore. This resulted in schools closing down in those countries and switching to online schools to prevent the spread of the virus and the number of preventable deaths by this virus. Not only does this benefit the students by protecting them from a dangerous respiratory condition, but it also protects the world and those with weaker immune systems. 
8462	 The world is very diverse and filled with many people with stark contrasts in their ways of life, so to deny those suffering from a condition or those that are unable to attend the right to an education would be a serious failure in the education system. There is no reason as to why someone could not receive an education, as it is the duty of governments, school systems, and politicians to make sure everyone has that opportunity whether it be through online education or lessening college tuition. Making changes starts with small steps and the first small step to make education accessible is through online classes for everyone in the country. 
8463	Imagine a lost, confused version of yourself. Perhaps it's an essay, a project, or a personal situation that has you conflicted. You have no idea what to do or what to think of. You are stuck. The first thing that pops into your head is to consult your peers, but not just one. 
8464	Asking for advice from more than one person has many upsides. 
8465	You can see what others think of your situation, 
8466	there can be many different thoughts. Someone may suggest a better idea to you than others, 
8467	it is always beneficial for you to consider a different perspective. 
8468	Not all advice given is automatically good. Let's say, for example, you are planning to redecorate your bedroom. Someone offers a neon-yellow pillow for your chair. You think to yourself, no way . Someone else tells you to hang up squares cut out from cardboard around the border of the entrance. You think, huh, that's not such a bad idea , until you ask one more person. They suggest that you declutter your shelf and invest in new curtains for a clean and bright look. Brilliant! The third suggestion is far better than the rest. 
8469	Asking more than one person for advice is critical. You can see what others think, receive many different opinions that are better than the others, and view your dilemma in a new perspective. After all of that, your situation could seem easier to understand and not so terrible as you thought. Asking just one person for their thoughts is a mistake, do not forget to ask another! 
8470	somethings need to be heard by other people who care and possible can lead you to the right direction from the choice that you were going to make in the first place. 
8471	You should always seek another persons point of view or even advice because sometimes they may have a very valid point or a reasonable opinion. 
8472	"When seeking for advice is can be about anything, family, friends or just general decision making. Let's come up with an example, Generic_Name was friends with a group of kids since childhood, she starts to lose touch with them and realizes how much she needed them in her life but she doesn't know how to approach them or talk to them anymore. she decides to ask her older brother for advice, he tells her that she shouldn't even try but if she really wanted to then she should  ""just be straight up with them"". Her brother only says this because he dislikes some of Generic_Name's friends and finds them annoying. She doesn't really like that idea so she decides to ask someone else for their opinion "
8473	The way everyone problem solves and views things is different, not everyone has the same mindset which is why its important to hear multiple point of views.  
8474	When someone knows less about a situation it is sometimes better because they see everything from an outside perspective creating a less bias opinion or neutral opinion. When you ask multiple different people for advice on one topic, you are searching for a general opinion/ idea or a pattern in what people have to say to then influence your decision. If you chose not hear from a few people one persons opinion may be bias and can heavily influence your decision in a good or bad way 
8475	Hearing many different sides can help you come to a better conclusion of your own because you can then weigh out the pros and cons of your situation 
8476	Everyone's point of view will be different like that of your 13 year old friend who is your age and knows you very personally or of your 72 year old grandmother. Your friend may know you well but your grandmother has lived longer as has possibly experienced the same things you are currently experiencing. Each has its own benefit and can help add onto your thought process. 
8477	It also imperative to look at all angles of your situation because you may not being seeing important factors that can help you problem solve that someone else may see.  
8478	Not only will you be building your knowledge on how to deal with those kind of situations but you are also learning how to put together ideas to form your own. Asking multiple people will push you to think more and create a well thought out plan. You also learn not rely on one specific person just in case their opinion is bias when it comes to a certain topic. That is why I believe that seeking advice from multiple people can help you make a better choice. 
8479	Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. This allows students to learn in the comfort of their own home, without having to transport to a private, or public school. This may be convienent for parents who work on a busy schedule, allowing them to choose when and where they want their chilldren to learn.  Although online schooling my be beneficial to some children, it may harm their future. 
8480	With this being said, students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing 
8481	they wouldn't develop social skills 
8482	they would have a hard time creating relationships with others 
8483	they may struggle from lack of motivation and depression. 
8484	To grow as an individual, it is essential to surround oneself with others. This is because it allows individuals to develop skills that may make or break their future. These skills are called social skills, and they should be developed as a child. Social skills are important for student development because it allows them to communicate with the people surrounding them on an every day basis 
8485	Schools were intended to bring students together, allowing communication with one another, which is why it is so important for students to learn in grow in schools that are not online. 
8486	Social skills may also be one of the biggest things a student can learn in school, and this is something that online schooling does not offer. Communicating with one another will allow students to work and learn together, creating relationships on the way. If students are not surrounded by others, they will have a difficult time creating relationships and friendships with others.  
8487	Relationships play a huge role in almost everyone's life. Whether their romantic, family oriented, or friendships, they are an important way to grow as an individual. Students who attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing may find it difficult to create relationships that are not family oriented because they are not surrounded by other students every day. While students who attend online school are in the comfort of their own home, students that attend schools outside of their home are comforted by the people surrounding them 
8488	This is why students who attend school outside of their home have a major advantage, which is developing relationships. 
8489	Students will also get a sense of who they are and what they like when engaging and developing relationships with other students, which students who take school online will not be able to do. Most students find joy in creating relationships with others, so they are excited to wake up every morning for school. Those who aren't able to create bonds with others may lack that motivation to get up every morning, which may take a toll on their mental health. 
8490	Students who attend school beyond the comfort of their own household may have more motivation to get out of bed every morning than those who take school online 
8491	This is because the students who are enrolled in schools may look forward to getting out of the house and seeing their friends every morning, while the students who are enrolled in online schooling have to stay in, isolated from things beyond their household. This may cause harm on the mental health of the students taking school online because they may feel excluded from the world around them. Feeling excluded from the world around them may place a sense of loneless in their life, which may lead to depression. Students should be surrounded by others as they grow so they can maintain a healthy mental state, and be happy. 
8492	Critics may argue that online schooling has a positive impact on students because if they learn in an enviorment that they feel most comfortable in, then they will be able to absorb more information on a daily basis. They may also say that it is more managable for busy students, and that they can work their schedules around education. 
8493	However, students who learn at home all their life will suffer from a lack social skills, and will have a hard time fitting in in the real world. 
8494	Students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because they wouldn't develop social skills, they would have a hard time creating relationships with others, and they may struggle from lack of motivation and depression. 
8495	Some people would say that it is the heavy cost of a social life to take classes online instead of going to a traditional brick and mortar school. They believe that by taking online classes, people are less equipped in dealing with face-to-face interactions in the real world when the time comes. However, these people also fail to consider that there are flaws in brick and mortar schools which can burden those who prefer an option of taking classes online instead. Although some may believe otherwise 
8496	One reason why students would benefit to attend classes from home is if they have limited social skills and they are not comfortable with vocally situating themselves in a physical classroom. 
8497	A personal situation which displays this is my cousin Generic_Name, who decided to take online classes starting his first year of middle school due to his severe anxiety since 4th grade which made it hard for him to interact with other students since he was younger. His anxiety also impacted him since it became more difficult with concentrating and asking for guidance from teachers, in fear of them judging him for it. However, after finishing his first year of online school, Generic_Name had claimed that by taking his courses online, he felt more comfortable in pursuing help from his teachers in courses he struggled with and concentrate without thinking about the impending presence of other students. If Generic_Name had not taken online courses for his schooling and had gone to a brick and mortar school instead, he would have felt more miserable since that was where he would have been forced to have physical interactions in order to resolve his academic problems and the stress it brought to him would also hinder his ability to learn. 
8498	Another reason why it would positively impact students to take online courses from the comfort of their homes is because there are less likely scenarios of a student missing their classes from any kind of emergency. 
8499	A case which exemplies this is from another cousin, named Generic_Name, who is currently taking his school courses online admist the epidemic of the corona virus. The corona virus, which wildly spread in his hometown of Generic_City, prompted his school district to take measures in making students continue their academic courses online without the risk of exploiting students in schools where a virus is likely to spread. By making the decision for students to continue classes through online means instead, there are less chances of Generic_Name's school district of possibly extending the school year to make up for all missed days. Without the option of being able to attend classes from home, both Alex and his school district would have been negatively affected by the epidemic from possible delays in schools to a higher chance of catching the virus. 
8500	Another person who illustrates why attending online courses prevents missing class for emergencies is from a situation my childhood friend Generic_Name had two years ago, when her older sister Generic_Name, who lived in Generic_City, got into a heavy car accident and Generic_Name and her single mother sponantiously made plans to go visit her since Generic_Name could not stay home alone. However, since Generic_Name had been taking her academic courses online, it did not make it hard for her to catch up on her work because all she really needed was a computer and there was no need for her to be in a physical classroom to participate. By being able to take her classes by ways of online, Generic_Name's school work did not heavily interfer with the sudden emergency and she had the flexibility of doing her work no matter where she was. 
8501	Lastly, it would be beneficial for students to be able to take classes online because it gives more flexability to students with a busy personal life. 
8502	For instance, Emma Chamberlain, a popular YouTuber known for her witty persona, had dicussed in a video that she decided to take her junior high school year through online classes because she wanted to focus on her rising career. Her decision to do so was very intelligible in the end, given the fact that she mainly filmed videos throughout the day and frequently traveled across the U.S. due to job opportunites and sponserships from brands. Without the flexibility given to her from online classes, Emma would not be able to do what she constantly does today which would mean having less time in being able to film her videos and seeking out her passions of being a prominent figure in YouTube. 
8503	Another person who illustrates this is my same friend Generic_Name, who had a demanding part time job at a cafe during the morning of school weekdays in order to finacially support her family. Since she took her academic courses online, she was able to have a flexible shift and work for longer hours because there was no given time that she had to be present in class. If she had not been doing school through online means, it would not have been possible for her to take on the job at an hour where most students are actively learning in school. 
8504	By choosing to not take a traditional school, an individual is able to focus more than just their academic life and able to take on more opportunites that most likely would not be given if it were not for this barrier. Also, attending classes online pushes a person on being more independent because it is ultimately all on them to juggle with their own academic and personal life. Although attending classes online might not be for everyone, it goes to show that there are many benefits one can take from it. 
8505	Many times throughout a school year students are given projects to work on as a group which not only allows for the students to meet new people in their age group, but also allows for them to develop communication skills. These projects typically have some sort of reflection at the end so that the students are able to discuss who in the group put in the most effort which encourages all of the students in the group to try their hardest and collaborate with each other. Part of this collaboration involves working around each others schedules and sacrificing time to check over each others work. Sadly, the skills learned from these projects cannot be learned when utilizing distance learning. Not only are the students unable to meet up in person to discuss their project, but online schools typically shy away from giving group projects due to the difficulty to work around other students schedules. Thus, distance learners are taught to be independent when completing work which can only serve to hinder them when they enter the job force. 
8506	Many classes, especially science, complete various different types of labs throughout their course. 
8507	These can include labs with chemicals, animals, or even virtual labs. The ability to complete these labs not only allows for students to better understand the topic that they are being taught, but also allows for the students to have hands on experience in a safe setting. Unsurprisingly, the same is not true of distance learners. Due to lack of materials, teacher guidance, safety equipment, and a safe area to complete labs distance learners are unable to get the same hands on experience as those physically going to school. This absence of labs hinders the learning ability of the students and retention of the information they are being taught. 
8508	However, in extremely serious situations distance learning is able to be beneficiary for students. 
8509	One of these cases includes the very recent COVID-19, or corona virus. Distance learning, if implemented, will allow for students to remain at home and hopefully away from the virus while still being able to complete their lessons. Not only will this allow for the students to not fall behind on their school work during this period of time, but it will also allow for the school district to not need to add in extra days to the school year. Other cases in which distance learning can and has been implemented is in cases of students contracting mono, having severe eating disorders, or having some form of anxiety. All of these examples allow for a brief period away from school for students to recover before they are able to return again. 
8510	Distance learning is a tool that should be utilized by schools only when student(s) are in dire need of time away from school. It should not be utilized as a replacement for school due to its ability to only teach independence, and hinder the collaboration capabilities along with social skills of students. Additionally, distance learning does not allow for students to receive hands on experience or access to laboratories. Despite being effective for short amounts of time, distance learning should not be implemented year round due to its ability to hinder the growth and learning of students and because of its lack of benefit to students not suffering from a mental illness or some form of sickness.  
8511	For hundreds of years the traditional school teaching environment has always been in person, sitting in a classroom with a teacher up in front. However, with technology and innovation in the current generations, the traditional classroom teaching environment might change. Currently there are options for students that do not wish to be in a school building but still want to receive education. With modern day technologies, learning online or by video conference has become easy to set up and has become a viable option 
8512	allows students with injuries or disabilities to participate and allows students to feel safe while learning.  
8513	Many areas and school districts are fortunate enough to provide school parking and bus routes for their students. However, many times students need to make an extraneous effort simply to get transportation to school. 
8514	Many students in my school district need to be driven to their nearest bus stop to even be able to ride for an hour to attend their local high school. Inclement weather or lack of a ride forces many of my school mates to miss class. These absences can be counteracted with the introduction of online classes. Students will benefit from online courses and curriculum without having to worry about having their transportation needs met. Students will be able to participate in an online classroom and engage with others without having to step out of their own home. Weather or lack of a ride forces many bright students to miss out on critical learning opportunities because of circumstantial needs. These aforementioned situations are common around the country and the introduction of online classes will alleviate these unfortunate absences.  Many schools outside of the country don't provide transportation services similar to the US. Students in Germany take the metro to get to school and many other students are forced to ride trains or local buses to their high schools. This may cause many students to feel unsafe and administer a feeling of fear with going to school. In many cases, girls feel unsafe to ride local buses and trains alone due to fear of sexual assault or kidnap. Rape and sexual assault are horrid things to think about but are often times reality for many females (and males) on public transportation. Online schooling offers a way for students to take classes online without having to worry about these issues. It gives students a chance to learn without worrying about their safety and the safety of others. 
8515	 Teenagers with disabilities or critical injuries will benefit from online schooling because it gives them a chance to participate in an everyday classroom setting without worrying about commute in between classes and bullying from others. 
8516	I am so thankful that I am fortunate enough to attend such an inclusive and disability friendly school, however, it is important to recognize that not all schools are like this. Bullying is a major issue within the public school system and many times students with disabilities become easy targets. These students are deserving of the same educational opportunities as everybody else and online classes offer that platform. Adding on, online classes revoke the need for commute between classes. There are times in which students in wheelchairs have trouble getting to class due to the overcrowded hallways and bustling of students. Schools with two to more stories also pose a problem of commute if the elevator breaks. These cases are solved with online schooling because students will no longer have to face these issues. Online classes will benefit teenagers with disabilities because they alleviate the potential threat of bullying and the need for commute between classes.  
8517	Others may argue that although being able to attend online classes provides a platform that solves transportation needs, it poses the threat of students falling behind due to lack of a physical teacher. 
8518	Although this is a reasonable concern, there is no need to worry. Students will be able to work with teachers online and there will still be teacher guidance within these classes. Online classes still have a grade book and many times, these classes offer live calls/chats with the teachers. Students will be able to work on their own time and still maintain grades 
8519	The schedule of a student attending any learning facility is made up of a list of their designated classes. A typical school day for them is to come to school, attend all the classes listed to them on that specific day, and go home. However, some schools offer distance learning for a student which is mainly a way for students to attend class at home through the use of video conferencing or taking the class online 
8520	While this may work for a few students, a majority of them would be prone to various distractions and inconveniences from being able to attend classes from home that wouldn't benefit them 
8521	When at school, students are surrounded in a complete learning environment, while at home, they are surrounded in a place of leisure. 
8522	A typical classroom is made up of chairs, desks, a white or chalk board, and sometimes posters that are associated with the subject of a class. In addition, a majority of the classes prohibit the use of cellphones to ensure that a students focus on the academic work given to them. In a home, there would be a noticeable difference. Most homes have some kind of electronic devices such as televisions or radios which students would have unrestricted access to. The student would also have unrestricted access to their cellphone, since there wouldn't be a teacher present to stop them 
8523	Now, there may be parental guidance present who could limit the amount of distractions 
8524	but the parent may have to go to work or run errands throughout the day, which would create a loophole for the students to have access to the various electronics in the house. 
8525	The major issue that arises is that with more access to electronics, the focus of students is redirected from the classes that they would be taking online to the programs being shown on the television or the incoming notifications they would be getting from their cellphones. This would not benefit them since they would not be getting the full context of what is being taught to them when they are attending classes from home compared to when they attend classes at a school since at home, they are surrounded by numerous distractions 
8526	Another major issue that would rise from students being able to attend classes from home is the dependence of technology that would be needed to teach the kids. 
8527	A major aspect of students attending classes from home is that all the teaching would have to be done online. Meaning that to learn that day, the student would have to have full access to an electronic device for a long period of time. Sometimes, technology isn't always reliable since it could easily stop working or lag. If this were to happen, a student wouldn't be able to access the classes he/she would have that day and in doing so, miss the content that was being taught in the class. This would not benefit them because if any day the computer or cellphone of a student was to not work, they would completely miss what was being taught in the class 
8528	however it is still more of a workload compared to if they were at a school. With being over reliant on technology, a majority of the students attending classes online would be prone to missing their classes due to technological issues which would prohibit them from acquiring the academic material being taught that day. 
8529	"In the world, going to school is a daily task or ""job"" for students. Imagine not having the opportunity to get an education. Schools around the world can offer many different types of learing. Some schools in fact offer distance learning for students as an option to attend classes from home. "
8530	because students will obtain a greater understanding of the material that is being taught 
8531	"teachers can give students ""hands on"" help in the classroom or before/after school hours "
8532	will improve students mental stamia in the classroom and throughout the day. 
8533	Students will obtain a greater understanding of the material that is being taught. 
8534	"Teachers can give students ""hands on"" help in the classroom or before/after school hours. "
8535	Students will improve their stamina in the classroom and throughout the day. 
8536	"School can help students achieve a greter goal in life and their understanding of the education and cirriculum is vital. It is an opportunity to get an occupation that they dream and strive to have. Students may think that they will benefit attending classes from home. However, Going to school to attend classes is far much more importants because students will understand more material in the classroom, they can get ""hands on"" help from teachers to benefit their learning, and improve their mental stamina throught the school day and in their daily life. "
8537	Over 50 years, homeschooling has become an effective method of education. Not only are students allowed access to online learning while in the comfort of their own home, but they are also allowed to work in an independent, comforting environment. A student's environmental standards should be relevantly met in order to provide an adequate performance. Even high school juniors and seniors are provided with the opportunity to take online courses at home. 
8538	But despite the minor distractions, students benefit from attending classes at home because they have options in managing their schedules, they are in a stress-reduced evironment, and because they do not have to endure obstacles as done in school. 
8539	For this reason, access to learning at home should become an option. This solution will reduce the amount of wasted time for both teachers and students and it will teach students the curriculum.  
8540	Aside from time management, students are strongly encouraged to strive and maintain their best efforts; although, this cannot be done in a stressful environment. Home may be considered a soothing, recapaliation location; whereas school is a stress induced setting, where sitting all day is tiring, lectures are given with no breaks, and students are uneasy. Classwork is given consequetively causing the brain to slow down its production. Meanwhile at home, students may choose their own pace to learn at and take breaks when needed. The stress at school not only reflects a negative environment, but it also affects the children and students from learning effectively. Based off my experience, I can declare that my mind flows better at home than it does in school. In English class I cannot seem to concetrate when writing the journals of the day. While at home, my thoughts flow like a stream. 
8541	The prior classes replaced my energy with stress, destroying my brain's ability to function. Because of stress in school, classes should be accessed at home. 
8542	In addition to the benefits of time management and a stress-reduced environment from courses at home, students are additionally eliminated from the obstacles endured in school. 
8543	Waking up for school five days a week, at 5 a. m. is a challenge. Some teenagers, such as myself, are sleep deprived for righteous reasons: working late and completing homework or projects. Others have to do both, once in a while. But learning at home can give students an opportunity to get enough rest to get their work completed. Furthermore, some days at school are not spent learning. Instead, they are spent out of class because of school cancellations due to incliment weather, out-of-school suspensions, in-school-suspensions, or in the administrators office, getting disciplined for a violation of the dress code. Valuable instructional time is lost, whereas online education works around these obstacles. As a matter of fact, none of these factors are of importance when one is attending school from home. The minor, problematic situations at school are what make classes from home more beneficial. 
8544	There are many aspects to learning and education that is different for all students. Some people are naturally gifted in certain areas, and others may struggle in that same area. Nevertheless, everyone learns at a different pace, and it can't be expected for everyone to flourish in the same environment. 
8545	This is why attending school from home would be very beneficial and necessary to particular individuals.  
8546	Home schooling could be an advantage to those that struggle with the pace of standard in-school education. 
8547	Especially in this day and age, many more people are concerned with tending to the specialized needs of kids. The way we learn and develop is being taken a lot more seriously now, and the importance of having the right accomodations for your circumstances is highly enforced. Those that may learn at a lower level or at a slower pace now have the option to not feel judged by the rate that all of their peers are learning at. By being in the comfort of their own home, it could allow them to become more confident in their abilities and achieve more compared to if they were in a standard school. Along with the elimination of judgement, it could also drastically improve their level of thinking as well. There's a huge difference in spending time to focus on the needs of one student as opposed to an entire classroom of students. By isolating an individual, it allows for their educator to identify their strengths and weaknesses which makes the process of helping them a lot less difficult. 
8548	In addition, there are also many social factors that could go into a student thriving while being taught at home rather than in school. 
8549	It's no surprise to anyone that bullying and harrassment goes on, not only in adolescence, but all throughout life for some people. If a child was facing this type of harrassment in school, the ability to take classes from home would eliminate that stressor for them. They wouldn't have to worry about coming into class every day and having to confront their bullies. This would be beneficial for a multitude of reasons, and it can also be a preventative measure to ensure the safety of students as well. Peers have an enormous amount of influence and power over the actions of certain individuals, and being forced to interact with that kind of behavior all the time could potentially pose as a threat. Being taught at home gives students the ability to control who they get to see and when, and for some people, it is absolutely necessary for them to have this option. 
8550	Finally, learning from home could prove to be beneficial for those that need to complete their education but already have a plan for their lives. 
8551	"In this new era of social media and technology, ""social media influencer"" is a very popular career path for people to take on. This generally entails posting pictures or videos, having sponsorships with companies, and interacting with their fan bases. Another common facet for this lifestyle is travelling. With all of this extra work these influencers choose to incorporate into their lives, school becomes a lot harder to maintain. Online based learning, in this case, makes it a lot more accessible and easy for these young kids to finish their education while still pursuing their dreams. "
8552	Overall, online and home-based learning proves to be very advantageous to a mass of people all over the world. Whatever the circumstance may be, merely having the option to opt out of standardized in-school learning is a very forward and advanced way of taking into consideration the needs of others. It gives students the opportunity to become confident, feel safe, and even pursue their dreams. For these reasons, I believe being educated from home is an exceptional concept that is appreciated by many. 
8553	Multiple opinions change surveys drastically. You may have received a data project at school or a survey for a new town project. These studies are most effective when more opinions are collected from. In order to make major decisions, you must first ask the people involved 
8554	Seeking multiple opinions is a key part of collecting rich data. 
8555	The most effective way to collect data is by collecting the opinions of the ones involved. 
8556	Today, petitions are used to persuade ideas for rules or laws in society. The more people on the list, the more likely the petition will be considered. Multiple opinions have a leading role in persuasion. Seventh grade taught me a valuable lesson when I decided to create a petition on banning a specific math program called IXL from my school lessons. This petition started out with only a few people but it changed heavily when I asked many more people. More people wanted to join this petition I had created after viewing the stunning amount of signatures added. The shocking amount of people added to one side of the argument caused them to jump onto the bandwagon too. I knew the average number of people on one side after considering some offsets in which I concluded was driven by bandwagon 
8557	If one side of an argument has more people, that argument will become more popular among moderates. Multiple opinions help fianl decisions when acknowledging bandwagons. 
8558	While most situations are best for all opinions, some data is best collected from just a designated group of people. 
8559	For example, an election for the Senate seat representing Virginia is best decided for residents of Virginia. It would be nonsensical for a resident of another state to vote in this example. The people involved in this should be considered into the data. A right choice for a decision comes from the people that are affected and involved. 
8560	As long as it might take to gather, more opinions matter. Multiple opinions matter because it show the true opinion of the ones involved and affected. Bandwagons must be considered into data because some will choose the side most picked. Choosing the best choice is interrupted by bandwagons that should be acknowledged into a final choice. When collecting data, make sure to collect from only those involved and effected by the decision. Seeking multiple opinions is a key part of collecting rich data. 
8561	In a Presidential vote, does the country ask only one person about who they want for president, or the whole country? You could only imagine what only having one person's opinion could do to this country. Having people vote as a whole seems to be very beneficial to America, and may be beneficial to you as well. 
8562	Sometimes it is better to have multiple people state their opinion before you make a big decision 
8563	You should seek advice from multiple people because it will help make your choice easier, 
8564	give you different viewpoints 
8565	improve the outcome of your decision.  
8566	This takes some stress out of your choice because then you know what the majority thinks. At the end of the day it is still your choice to make, regardless of what anyone thinks or says. There are an endless amount of decisions that people seek personal opinions on no matter how serious. When you're going out to eat with a group you ask them where they want to go. The NFL or NBA Most Valuable Player isn't chosen by just one person, it's asked about by fans, coaches, and players to see who the majority thinks deserves it. Now this does not guarantee the right choice will be made, but in the past it has proven that it has the potential to be helpful. 
8567	With the help of trustworthy and honest peers, your decision is a lot more dependable. Hearing what others believe to be true tends to help. You have to remember to ask trustworthy people, and even then your decision may not be a good one. Even some of the smartest people in America, including our president, congress, and all of the houses ask for opinions from the people. Sure a few bad choices have been made, but I strongly feel the good heavily outweigh the bad. I also believe that the good outweigh the bad on even tiny decisions made day to day when you have multiple different perspectives. You can't go wrong with other people's help on choices no matter how big or small. 
8568	You should seek advice from multiple people because it will help make your choice easier, give you different viewpoints, and improve the outcome of your decision. It is truly better to ask around for help on a topic then choose on your own. The are way more benefits than downfalls. 
8569	With different perspectives you can either add to your argument or see through another persons eyes on why they think what they think. Would you rather take the risk of making a poor choice or receive insight on what you should really do? 
8570	Have you ever needed advice from someone? If so, you probably talked to multiple people before you went on with what you were going to do. 
8571	getting different perspectives 
8572	see the other side of an issue 
8573	get more information on the subject. 
8574	With advice, you want to know the other side of something and if what you're going to do is right or wrong. 
8575	You can develop potential arguments to strengthen your side and you can know everyone's views to go along with your subject. Based on what you learn from everyone, you could get the full circle of information on what you'd like to learn about. 
8576	You can learn from other's experience, and in the end learn from your own. You'll know what went wrong in what the person did and why you're getting that advice. Other people will also think one thing is more important than the other. You'll have an overall bigger decision to make in the end with who's advice you're going to follow and how you're going to do it. 
8577	The United States has one of the worst public school systems in the modern world. Places like Sweden and Denmark show fantastic, flawless designs that allow students to properly use their time for both school and non-school activities. Our public schools, however, show many flaws that were enacted by generations in the past. Students fail to learn proper time management, as they are forced to go to places they are unfamiliar with and follow prepared schedules in and out of class. As this continued, the government discovered the flaws and are beginning to try new solutions. One of these solutions is online classes that students can take at home. 
8578	One of the systems' largest problem is forcing students to attend and learn in places that are unfamiliar and daunting to them 
8579	According to majority of students in a poll last year, research has shown that students consider school buildings as uncomfortable, as well as unfamiliar. On that same poll, the same research claimed that students found the idea of learning at home appealing, and a much better suited place to learn. This same evidence supports the ideas that parents whose children are in homeschooling programs share. Hearts, a homeschooling program ran through Generic_City and all over the east coast, has a much larger graduation rate in students and higher averaged grades than public schools in the same areas 
8580	Some people could argue that this holds the threat of exposing distractions to students. 
8581	With the ability to modify their own environment, students can create their own spaces that allow them to concentrate on their studies with ease. 
8582	Majority of current online classing has a system that allows teachers to record or stream lectures that explain the material. Then, if students had questions, the teacher could answer them in the stream or message the students independently. This method is fantastic, because all of the lectures can be recorded and shown for future reference at other times. If students didn't understand the material, they could just load up the needed information and relearn it and solidify the information into their memory. With this, students can make sure that they received and understood all of the content that they need to know for the classes that they are taking.  
8583	Along with having control over setting, students would be given control over how they use their time. Homeschooled students often have a lot of time to allocate for school and other activities. This is essential for every student to understand and master, as they will have the same choices when they grow into adults. Students who have other obligations outside of school will be allowed to modify their learning time each day, as well as take breaks from work as needed 
8584	Many people argue that students can abuse this opportunity as to skip learning altogether, and allow them to grow bad habits. 
8585	The entire purpose behind having the choice is to learn from mistakes. If no mistakes were made, then no one could improve. Online classing allows students to learn what to do in a safe and open environment. Without that chance, students would make the same mistakes in more important matters, and harm their well being later in life. 
8586	The largest flaw that has been located is this: some students benefit more from learning in person rather than online. 
8587	The beauty behind this whole process is that online classes don't eliminate the ability to have face to face classroom interactions that students have today. 
8588	Yes, online classes are meant to somewhat eliminate this factor, but in person interactions are also needed to have students grow. Hearts, the program mentioned above, has a system that has students meet their teachers in person once or twice a week. This allows teachers to show students real life applications with the information taught in class, as well as give students the ability to have social interaction with both teachers and other students. This allows the students to gain the pros of both online classing and the modern classroom interaction 
8589	Students would benefit from online learning because it allows the students to learn in places more familiar to them, relearn challenging topics and units, and build proper time management skills. Throughout this article, evidence has been placed that support all three of these factors. Learning at home gives the students the ability to be taught in more comfortable environments rather than the common classroom. The ability to relearn lectures and other class materials allow students to master the topics given to them. Time management skills can be learned, as the students are given control over the ability to use their time in ways that they think is best. Even some of the common flaws of online classing has been addressed and solved. The ability to change the way we learn is something that I believe is essential to allow minds to reach their highest potential. No one learns the same way as the person next to them. That is why if people are starved of the choice to learn the way that they want, then us as a country will not be able to grow along with the rest of the world. If this method is amplified and improved, then America can become one of the most educated countries on earth. 
8590	Some people may say that taking school online or with video cameras is beneficial. Clearly, they are wrong 
8591	it would be easy to cheat 
8592	students would face isolation. 
8593	With online school, it would be extremely easy to cheat. 
8594	Many students would say that they would never do such a thing, that they must honor their integrity, but they're lying. Teenagers are impulsive, and if there is an easy road out, we are going to take it, simple as that. For example, if a teacher gives an assignment and they say the answer key is on schoology to check our work, we're going to maybe attempt it. When we don't succeed, guess where we're going: Schoology. I'm saying that I don't trust teenagers to be able to honestly do every single assignment on their own especially if there are no eyes watching. Another example of this would be in a scenario of this said online school. Imagine that there's a big test due on the 18th in math that you haven't studied for. Today is the 17th. Everyone else has done the test and taken pictures of it in case their computers shut down, while others had malicious intent. You haven't studied at all. Your failure is imminent as you already have a C in the class and you need a C to graduate. Your heart is thumping, you don't want to seem a failure to your parents. So what do you do? Ask the teacher for an extension? No, he's too strict and he's going to say no. So you think your only option is to cheat. So you text a student who took picures for the wrong reason. You get the answers you so desperately wanted. But at what cost? You take the test and get a 70. You nearly failed, but you didn't. You find out a few days later that several students have asked for an extension and received one. That is the mindset a lot of students go through when they cheat on a test or assignment. 
8595	One thing a person could face while attending online school is isolation. 
8596	"In prison, solitary confinement is a punishment, so why make it an everyday thing as a free person? The best part about school for most, if not all, of us is our friends. For those with best friends, going a long time without them is a task. You don't have your laughing buddy and you miss them, even if you have other friends you couldnt be with. Most people feel sad when they don't have a friend to be with them in class and share the same struggles with when you fail or do bad. School is at least seventy-seven percent better when you have friends to go at it with. When you're in your room all day learning, that's no fun. School is required by the government and is already sad enough as it is. The only thing that personally keeps me going is my friends. Without them, I would have no will to do my work as they are the ones constantly telling me to do this and do that and don't procrastinate. Those friendly reminders are honestly what keep me from failing my classes. I couldn't name all the times I forgot to do an assignment and my friends were like, ""did you do so and so?"" And I would say, ""oh wow I completely forgot about that, thanks for reminding me,"" and would get started at lunch or in the morning. So if school were to be offered online, those reminders would fall through the cracks and I would have missing assignments left and right. "
8597	Some people say that taking school online or with video cameras is beneficial. However, they are incorrect because it would be easy to cheat and students would face isolation from their friends. Cheating would be readily available as you don't have the teachers eyes on you which makes it easier to cheat, no matter how honest a teenager says they are because we are impulsive beings who rarely think logically. Isolation would be a terrible added factor of online school as friends keep most of us going during the school day. 
8598	because it would allow them to not have additional school days at the end of the year due to weather 
8599	allow them to not fall behind on work due to an illness or family situation. 
8600	By offering distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home, they'll be able to continue their learning while not having to worry about falling behind or having to attend school later into the summer. 
8601	Many states in the United States get snow on a yearly basis, and as much as students love snow days, sometimes they can hinder a student's learning progress by preventing them from being able to travel to school safely. 
8602	Many states have a law saying that if too many days of school are canceled due to inclement weather, school days will unfortunately have to be added onto the end of the school year, so students can complete their education for that year. This can cause problems for many students as they might have a summer vacation already planned that'll have to be adjusted due to the extended school year. For instance, there was one year where my county had to add school days onto the end of the year due to additional snow days and that had messed up a lot of student's plans for the summer. Personally, I was able to adjust my vacation plans; however, I had many friends who ended up having to miss the last week of school due to this. If schools offered distance learning on these snow days, where students can still attend class online with their teachers, they can prevent additional school days at the end of the year due to weather. 
8603	Distance learning by way of online or video conferencing is also beneficial to students because it'll allow them to stay on track with school work and not fall behind due to an illness or family situation. 
8604	There have been countless times where a student has been sick with a serious illness or had a family situation that prevented them from going to school for a week or so. Just missing one day of school causes a student to fall behind on a lot of work, so missing more than a week of school can definitely hinder a student's learning progress. I've had friends who were sick with an illness, like pneumonia, and were out of school for about two weeks; it took them weeks to be able to catch up and make up all of their missing work. 
8605	Another example where distance learning is beneficial for students is when they have a family situation. A student might be out of school for a couple days due to a family situation and could fall behind on work. Being able to go to school online or video conference would help that student stay on track with work and not have to spend a week trying to catch up on missed work when they return to school. For example, I had a family member suddenly pass away a while ago, and I had to attend their funeral. As a result, I had to miss a couple of days of school and fell behind on a lot of work. Because it was so sudden, I couldn't plan ahead with my teachers and eventually was stressed out when I came back to school due to the amount of work I had. If online learning had been an option for me, I would've been able to stay on track in school and not have to deal with the stresses of catching up on missed work. 
8606	I understand that online learning might not be beneficial for all students since each student has their own way of learning and that some students might not have the technology for it at home; 
8607	I think it would be a beneficial option to implement into the school systems in the long term. 
8608	Many students struggle during the school year because of missing school days, whether it's due to weather or due to a family situation, and distance learning would be a great option for those students to be able to stay on track with the school curriculum while missing school. Offering online learning will help a student continue their education, prevent them from falling behind in school, and create less stress for them to catch up on missed work; therefore, I think online learning would be beneficial for students and that schools should implement it into their systems.  
8609	Have you ever asked someone for advice? I always ask people for advise it makes things a lot easier. 
8610	you would want to ask someone who has been through it before, 
8611	one person might not be good at giving advise as someone else would, 
8612	one person might not have your best interest in mind like some others. 
8613	For example if you ask one friend they might have not experienced what your talking about, but if you ask another one your chances are higher because you asked more people. I always ask at least two people before making a big decision. If you asked for advise on how to swim you would want to hear from a swimmer not someone who cant swim so it would be smarter to ask multiple people. I once asked the wrong person how to ride a bike and I still feel the pain to this day. Just sit there and think for a second, The more people you ask the more likely youve asked someone that has gone through it before. This is like in the movies when a girl is in a breakup and is asking her friend what should she do. This is my first reason why I think asking multiple people for advice is better that one. 
8614	What if you ask one friend for advice and their mad at the moment and they probably dont have your best interest in mind and you should get another opinion. I try not to ask mad friends for advise when possible.  You should ask multiple people because everyone dosent know whats best for you. My parents are the only people who know whats best for me.  Also your friends and peers dont always have your best interest in mind, sometimes they could give you bad advice to be funny. This happens to me all the time. This is my third reason why seeking more than one opinion can help you make a better choice. 
8615	It is alarming to think that less than twenty years ago virtual technology was just being invented, and ever since the turn of the 21st century the world has started to use technology and virtual data more and more. The world has started to trend in a direction in which humans rely on technology. For example, tools like phones and cars are used everyday. Virtual technology can be helpful however, and it is currently expanding to provide humans with new ways to make life easier. One way technology is being introduced to benefit humans is through distance learning or online classes. This new form of learning allows students to attend school from the comfort of their own homes. 
8616	Distance learning gives students a more customized and adaptive learning experience while giving students more time to engage in the extracurriculars they love. 
8617	One way distance learning is beneficial for students is because it allows students to customize their classes. 
8618	For example, Students in the public education system can only enroll in courses that are offered at their school. This may restrict students from taking classes that they are interested in or limit students from branching out and potentially finding a new passion. However, students taking online classes can choose from a wide variety of classes, that most likely incorporate their interests. The lack of restraint in regards to the courses offered in distance learning is beneficial for students. Not only do student have the freedom to choose what to learn, they also have the freedom to choose when to learn. Having the freedom of choosing when to learn is vital for students with specific needs or disabilities. When students are unable to go to school, learning can continue. This eliminates sick days, weather delays or cancellations, and school holidays. Furthermore, students are able to take courses at their own speed. Rather than the typical every other day school schedule, students can master a course in less than a month. The lack of restraint in regards to the courses offered in distance learning and when a student can learn is beneficial for all students. 
8619	Another benefit to learning from home is that it gives students more time to focus on their needs and wants rather than the schools. 
8620	In certain cases when student prodigies are more focused on a sport, a musical instrument or a job, learning from home can grant students more time to perfect their craft. Online learning allows them to have their primary focus being on what they love rather than on a rigorous and time wasting traditional school day. Another example is in the case of a student that does not thrive in a the social aspect of school. Sometimes kids feel overwhelmed and threatened by the large amount of students in one school. In order to feel comfortable, kids could video conference into school and learn from the comfort of their own home. School can be long and sometimes overwhelming so in certain cases distance learning can be beneficial. 
8621	Having a strong and well education is what is the most important when it comes to any person seeking the knowledge and insight to be able to pursue any career opportunities or other varying professions and lifestyles; furthermore, it is more widely known for students to attend a school and take courses from there 
8622	Although it may be a better environment for students to go to classes and communicate in real life with their teachers and other peers, It would be more beneficial for students to have the choice to attend classes from home through the use of either online courses or video conferencing. 
8623	Online classes would be a great tool and advantage for those who wants to continue their education because it provides scholars not only to be more efficient and organized 
8624	but to also help those who are not comfortable in the environment of a school in general. 
8625	It is a modern era for both the teacher and the learner, so it is essential for all persons to have the opportunity to continue their education with ease and will.  
8626	Without a doubt, it is a necessity for any student to have the skills of efficiency and organization through a means of completing the assignments and work provided to them, for it is what will help them in the near future. 
8627	Online classes with help because to allows them to take notes or tests in a familiar atmosphere, which will make them more paced and manageable. Being able to do work or assignments at home is favorable because it lets students complete tasks without the need for judgment and pressure a normal, old fashioned institution would emit. Stress is a common factor in terms of learning, for the expectations of a normal school would have any person feeling doubtful and overwhelmed; however, these online classes provide students with the chance to do what they need to do with simplicity and intuition. 
8628	Some may say that one would not be able to learn well when only looking at a screen; 
8629	however, video conferencing allows the student to still be at home, but also learning face to face with their teacher or professor. Having all of your courses laid out with clarity through digital aspects shows that it would be easy for any person to become more organized and efficient though navigating these courses with clarity at home and managing your time well in a comfortable setting with efficiency. 
8630	Not every person has the same lifestyle as the next, everyone has their own differing personalities and character traits that may or may not clash with others 
8631	A comfortable atmosphere for a person seeking to expand their knowledge will be most beneficial because it allows someone who has difficulty in social setting to not feel as if they are being punished for wanting to continue on with schooling. 
8632	People can be complicated, one may never know what is going on in another's life. Every person is different, no one is the same as the next in any way, shape, or form. Taking classes from home would help eliminate those who are uncomfortable in the environment an everyday school would have, such as those with anti-social tendencies or anxiety. Having so many students in just one building causes many conflicts, whether they be through two students, or between a student and their teacher. Within a school, it is inevitable for there to be an issue depending on how one may react and feel. 
8633	, it would help prevent conflicts such as bullying. Staying at home with the responsibility to complete work should be desirable for any person wishing to pursue their educative life, no person should feel uncomfortable or in dismay when it comes to wanting to learn. 
8634	Despite what one may believe when it comes to school, it is essential for anyone to have the opportunity to attend online school from home. Being in the familiarity and comfort of your own home causes beneficial aspects to ones life. It allows them to become more efficient, along with other skills needed to be successful. Prevention of any sort of conflict is important and needed to help whoever is having an issue. Online school is the new frontier, and to many, has already done its justice. Online school should be seen as the next best thing for any person who wishes to pursue their knowledge. It is time to get past the old-fashioned ideologies that learning should be done in a classroom, we are past that age and are continuing on into a new one.         
8635	Many famous people who became famous for their work of whatever expertise they acquired usually didn't ask for just one specific person's idea. They saw many people's criticism to something that they made, and they improved their idea gradually, such as  The Simpsons.  When they first made the main characters, it seemed to be poorly drawn and the voices were weird, but as the episodes went on and on, the characters and voices had smoothed out and improved to what they are today. Having one person to ask for your opinion can sometimes be just the right thing to make your project approved by one person other than you, but sometimes asking other people can give you many more perspectives to look at, giving you an upgraded idea for the one you just had 
8636	Having many peoples' opinions presents you with different people giving their own taste at what they like and don't like with the idea you have. 
8637	Not everyone has the same idea for the ideal project that you think of. Each person has a different mind set on what they like and don't like, and what could be added or removed. When it comes to ethnicity and people's income, people can say that the idea is too much money, or that some people might not like something about the idea because it upsets their culture or beliefs. This can make you consider whether you can change the idea to make it less cruel to the person's culture or beliefs, or you can also consider dropping the price of the idea you have. The idea can also affect different types of ages, because they can think that the idea is cruel or misunderstood. An example is if you were trying to make a game based on WWII, some older people would not like it because it can portray the wrong idea of what happened. Although old people might not like it, many teenagers or young adults might like the idea of your game, and creating this story line from the old people's perspective might make the teenagers lose interest in the game you made, so it makes you think a lot whether you should agree with the old people, agree with the teenagers, or have a combination of both an older, original WWII story line, and a less original WWII story line. 
8638	People can point out problems with your idea, and find a way to correct the it. 
8639	If there is an error or flaw in your idea, they can point it out so your idea won't contain that flaw anymore. An example is the Apple Company that makes a variety of electronics that people. They don't have just one version of the idea that they made; they have many different types of phones, each coming from different years with different ideas of the ideal iPhone that everyone would like to buy. People give their ideas to the Apple Company, such as having a phone with no home button, having a bigger-sized phone, or even having a brand new product, like AirPods. Many people who ask one person think it can be embarrassing to ask someone if there is anything wrong just to find out there is something wrong, although it doesn't matter if you get embarrassed or not. It matters that you got the mistake from someone and corrected that mistake for the better of the people. In fact, having more problems is better than having none, because that just means you just have some more to work on, and if the first type of your idea doesn't work out, you can always try again and again with your idea until it has reached the best outcome it can possibly receive. 
8640	You can get many compliments on your idea, producing a good feeling that your idea is great. 
8641	"The more compliments you receive, the more people who say they like the idea. Many famous writers used other people's thoughts to see whether or not their book is good, and they ask for their opinion. An example from me is my favorite series of books:  Gone Series.  On the front cover of the book, it has one quote from an author, and on the back there were many other quotes from other companies. Adding to the quotes, on the top of the book said  #1 New York best Selling Book , basically saying to new readers that this series is good and popular. That is usually why on the front cover or back cover of a book contains a quote from different people or companies showing their good opinion about this book, so the readers can see that since this person liked the book, then it must be a good book to read. Having an award on your book also brings in popularity because winning something like the Pulitzer prize can bring a ton of attention to your book. It can give you more to believe in that your project will be good because you have many people who say your project is good. Not just the people who say that it's just ""good"", but also the people who point out the things that they especially liked within your idea, such as, ""I liked how you included this part to make that huge problem go away."" These kinds of compliments makes you feel even better inside, and it tells you that you can take your mind off that one part of the idea and imagine more possible problems. "
8642	It doesn't matter if you have a mistake or two in your idea that was pointed out by someone. What matters most is that you asked people for their opinion, and having the best idea you can have. When you ask people for their opinion, it gives you inspiration, courage, and perseverance to keep on doing your best, because in the end, it can turn out to be the best thing you ever did, maybe receiving a ton of money, winning awards for your accomplishments, or meeting other famous people who also like and use your idea on a daily basis. If your idea just doesn't work out in the end, you could either ask more people for their opinion on how to revive your idea, or it can be your end to the project and give up on the idea. Either way, it can at least be the most fun you've had working on an idea in your life. 
8643	Children were told sometime in their life that everybody was unique and different in some sort of way, that there were absolutely no two people that looks the same, much less think and act the same. This applies in everyday life from then and getting advice is not the exception. Everybody has different beliefs, experience and ways to do things so it's hard to find one person that exactly understand you to the point of giving you advice perfectly. 
8644	It's much better to talk to several different people and think about the different possibilities the advice might have to find the perfect solution for the problem. 
8645	Everybody was born differently, in different situations and in different times. This impacts their experiences, from every moment of their life. 
8646	In this case, and many others, seeking outside advise or help can solve this problem 
8647	Not only can seeking help create a better understanding for the person who was unsure of something 
8648	but it can also relieve stress and anxiety, which is a major component of a decision about to be made 
8649	Also, a further benefit of asking for outside help, is for the well-being of others. If this decision could affect the lives of other individuals, its only common sense to be one hundred and one percent sure before making that decision, and what better way to be one hundred and one percent sure than asking the advice of others.  
8650	Seeking understanding is a huge skill that many don't have and is a skill many should develop. 
8651	"Asking someone a simple question like ""Is this good to go?"" can truly impact someone's mindset of how to deal with problems, and can give them strong advice of how to handle the problem they currently have. Multiple pieces of advise would make an even bigger impact on a person and give them more understanding of what others think. Because of this they will be more prepared, and have a different mentality for future problems. From my personal experience, I can relate to having others critic and check my work because I know the helpfulness and understanding I get, can make a real impact on me. "
8652	 It has been proven that stress only causes harmful and emotional side effects to individuals. So, why not remove it? That is exactly why simple checks on your work, or something you may be unsure about can make a real impact. As stressful as everyday human lives can be, there's no harm done in taking a little out of your time to ask others about your situation and how to deal with it. Being more sure on something can cause an individual to worry less and end up making better decisions. Maybe you have a huge decision coming up like a proposal. You need to be absolutely sure and know it in your gut that this is the right decision to be made, and asking others can help you know that you are making the right decision or you are making the wrong decision 
8653	The more advice someone has, the more confident that someone can be, and can have less stress going through with that decision. 
8654	"If you live by the motto ""Put others before yourself"" it is critical to understand that the decision you make could negatively affect others, as well as yourself. An example of this is smoking marijuana. By doing this, you could be causing others to be doing it as well, just because you are doing it. You could be at a legal age, but marijuana is still bad for you as well as others. Asking your friends if they are okay with it and if it is a good decision, can cause you to realize that in the long run, it is a bad and not a thought-out decision. Like said before, other people's lives are also important and seeking help before a decision, to make sure that it is good and well-thought out, can make a true impact in others. "
8655	Also, as modern day society is getting bigger and bigger, and people are becoming more reliant on safety, it is extremely important to ensure and provide safety for each individual, and asking for other's advice can ensure you that your decision is safe and responsible. 
8656	All people strive to do what's right, whether it be doing right toward others, or to yourself.  Doing right toward others and yourself doesn't just mean getting good grades or achieving an award, but it means doing the right thing. Asking others for advice can ensure that you are doing right toward others and yourself. When doing this, you can seek out understanding of the problem you are facing, which can be an important skill for people to have. Throughout asking others for advice, you can relieve stress by knowing what you did was right, and you can be assured that what you are doing is safe and responsible, which won't have side effects that could harm or hurt others. A simple skill, asking others for help or advice, can truly make in impact in others and yourself. 
8657	Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice 
8658	one person could know more about the situation 
8659	someone could have gone through something similar, 
8660	you could see how different people react to the problem. 
8661	The first reason I think seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is that one person could know more about the situation than others. 
8662	Another example is if you want to buy your best friend a gift for her birthday but you don't know what to get her. You decide to ask your friends to help you pick a present and they don't know what to get her either, so you decide to ask her boyfriend what you should get her and he tells you that she told him that she wanted to take a trip to the spa. Then you would know what to get your friend because you asked someone else who knew more about the situation. 
8663	The next reason I think seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is someone you ask could have gone through something similar and know what to do about the situation 
8664	Let's say Generic_Name was still unsure about what to do about her toxic friend, she could ask her old friend Generic_Name, who stopped talking to Generic_Name a while ago, what to do. Generic_Name knew that Generic_Name used to playfully make fun of Generic_Name but then one day Generic_Name just left the group. Generic_Name could tell Generic_Name that she went through the same thing and she just couldn't take it anymore and she had to leave that situation. This information could help Generic_Name make a choice because she now knows that Generic_Name has treated her friends like this in the past and that she is not just being sensitive 
8665	Another example is if you want to adopt a new pet but you don't know if you should adopt a hamster or a bird, so you decide to ask your friend, who has a bird, if you would be a good bird owner. Your friend could tell you that having a pet bird takes a lot of time and you need to be able to give your birds the proper care and attention that they need. Whereas when you asked your friend who has a hamster if they need a lot of attention she said no because they are nocturnal .You know that you're a very busy person so with the information your friends gave you, you can make an educated decision to not get the bird. 
8666	Finally, I think seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because you can see different people's reaction's to the situation 
8667	For instance, in Generic_Name's situation she asked three of her friends what to do about her toxic friend Generic_Name. Two of her friends told her bad things about Generic_Name and gave Generic_Name more reasons to stop being her friend, whereas only one of her friends told her to keep being Generic_Name's friend. Since more people reacted the same way to the situation, Generic_Name now had a more informed opinion and a better idea of what to do. 
8668	Another example is if you want to start a business selling jars filled with dirt and you ask your friends if you should. Your friends could give you different reactions to the idea. Four of them could say that it's a terrible business idea and two of them could tell you to go for it. Since more people felt that it was a bad idea you could rethink it and make a better decision in the end. 
8669	A lot of people think seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. I think this is true because the more you know about something the e better and Easier for you to pick choice 
8670	As the world has recently entered the era of technology, the possibilities that comes along with it seem to be boundless. Instantly having the ability to talk to someone halfway across the world and having access to so much knowledge at the click of a button are just a few of these possibilites. A new development in the area of education is online learning, where a student does not go to school and instead learns from the comfort of their own home. Although it sounds nice in theory, online learning for all students is not feasible nor is it realistic. 
8671	due to the fact many kids might get distracted and procrastinate, 
8672	some students may feel that they can never get a break since they always have access to the internet 
8673	students will miss out on many experiences and activities that come along with going to a physical school. 
8674	While the internet can be used in very useful and academic ways, there are also a plethora of ways to get sidetracked. Things like social media platforms and Netflix will always be there taunting the student, requiring a substantial amount of willpower to not give into these deep dark holes of mindless entertainment. If it is already hard enough for students to focus in classrooms with a physical adult present giving instructions, just think how much harder it will be to focus without any of these accomodations (plus the addition of having the freedom to wear pajamas and move at their own pace). Not only will they have other platforms distracting them, but they will also have to make sure they are staying on track and not pushing things off to the last minute 
8675	Students, especially high schoolers, have a tendency to procrastinate and wait until the night before to complete assignments, so what happens when a child decides to push all of their online classwork off to the last minute? 
8676	This is not a practice that is condusive to their future and cannot possibly be maintained healthily, thus showing that distance learning is not realistic. 
8677	Mental health has been a common topic over the past few years and the conversation around it is thankfully becoming more normalized. School is a huge facor that goes into mental health, and many students do not know when to stop overloading themselves with classes. They can get so caught up in doing well that it can destroy their mental, as well as physcial, health. 
8678	While a student cannot be in a physical building all the time, they have access to the internet at all hours of the day, putting unneeded stress on some students. 
8679	Due to the ability to be constantly working, this may make students feel like they can never truly get away from school. Even if a student travels or is on vacation, they could still be doing work. Students deserve breaks and the right to enjoy growing up, not having the shadow of a test or classwork loom over them twenty four-seven. This feeling can negatively impact a child's mental health, providing that distance learning would not beneficially impact students.  
8680	Lastly, distance learning makes students miss out on so many activities that come with going to a physical school. 
8681	School spirit and pep rallies, sports, and questionable cafeteria food are just a handful of these experiences. The American middle school and high school experience has been romanticized in countless movies and TV shows, and many do not wish to miss out on that. Even if good or bad experiences occur in a physical school, most adults look fondly upon their high school years as a learning experience and a time to have fun. Real friends and relationships blossom from having physcial interactions with each other, not sitting behind a screen. Distance learning can cause a student who is not a social butterfly to stay in isolation at their house, thus creating a breeding ground for mental illness. Going to a school in the presence of physical people is much simpler and benefits a child much more in regards to social interactions and access to activities. Online learning will cause students to miss out on great experiences; therefore, distance learning is not beneficial for students. 
8682	Procrastination is a word that teenagers are familiar with, and online learning creates an enviroment where it is too easy to push work back until the last minute. While students can push work back, they also have the constant ability to access their classes, putting excessive stress on a student and destroying their mental health. In addition, students will not be able to have the traditional American school experience they learn online. Even though we are moving into a new age where technology is heavily emphasized, sometimes it is best to stick with the traditional way.  
8683	''Hey, should I wear this or this tomorrow?'' I'm sure we've all had a friend ask us our opinion's on something, like what to wear on the first day of school, but ever wonder why they go and ask others on their perspective as well? 
8684	They want to know what the most common response is 
8685	they want to see other people's perspectives besides their own 
8686	keeping an opened mind. 
8687	Someone such as a friend will usually ask more than one of his/her piers on their thoughts or opinions on something and will go on asking more people the same question. After, he/she will take all the responses they have received and will most likely go with what the majority of what their piers said. People tend to do this because they want to have an open mind about what a group of people think rather than just one person. Next, why seeking multiple opinions can lead to a better choice. By asking multiple friends, piers, and even family members their thoughts on something that may or may not be important, it could help save someone from making a bad choice in the future. To conclude everything that was previously stated, Asking for multiple opinions is a great way to double check if someone is making the right choice because they will have stopped them from making a choice that they could have regretted ten years from then.  
8688	I know when I need someone's opinion I dont just ask one person I ask all my friends and even some of my family member's before I make a decision, and I also ask why they went with that choice to have a better understanding as to what helped them conclude to their response. By looking through someone else's perspective it could lead to a more open mind and can give a person more room to understand what other people think and why they think it . 
8689	Having an open mind is when someone is able to take other people's opinions and instead of judging it they try to understand it. I believe people who ask for multiple opinions are very open minded and are willing to listen to other people's perspective besides their own. In conclusion, it is always important to keep an open mind when asking other people for their opinions or advice. 
8690	You are presented with one of the toughest choices in your life.  As a gift, you received two tickets to Disney World.  One is for you, and the other is for whoever you choose.  All of a sudden, a million questions and possibilities fill your head.  Would you rather go to Disney World with your best friend or your significant other?  What about your brother, uncle, or mom?  With a problem like this, you have to seek advice.  Have you ever had an issue so tough that you needed to seek advice?  I know for certain that I have encountered this problem before.  With issues like that, I always seek advice from numerous people before making my final decision. 
8691	you can hear other people's points of view, 
8692	determine what the best choice is by finding which answer is said most, 
8693	learn life lessons from the people you seek advice from.  
8694	By asking many people for advice on the situation, you encounter people that are wiser, smarter, and far more experienced than yourself.  For example, I remember encountering a situation as a fifth grader where I had to choose between saving my money or buying a new gaming system.  I had been saving this money since fourth grade, and I had accumulated more than four hundred dollars.  When I went over to my cousin's house, I was able to play on his gaming system, and I thought it was really fun.  Before I left, I made sure to ask him if I should invest in the same gaming system or to save the money.  His response was to buy the system.  Even though I got the advice I needed, I made sure to ask other people the same question.  Next, I remember asking my parents if it would be worth it.  My mom had told me that we already had lots of video games.  On the other hand, my dad told me that it was my money, and if this is what I decided to spend is on, it was completely fine.  After seeking multiple points of view, I had finally made my decision.  I was going to buy the gaming system.  To this day, I still play on that console, and I do not regret my investment.  After asking many people, you start to see a pattern in answers.  In my case, I figured out that the majority of people I asked said it was a good idea to buy the console, 
8695	"If we go back to my story about whether or not to buy the console, the answer I received most was, ""Yes.""  Ultimately, that was a big factor that told me I should buy the console.  If you ask many people the same question and you get the same answer, whatever they are telling you is probably the smart and correct thing to do.  It may not necessarily be the decision you were thinking of making, but it may be one to consider.  Back at the beginning of the school year, my English teacher assigned our class a project where we have to make a difference in our community.  At first, my idea was to organize a community-wide sports equipment drive.  When I got home that day, I discussed my idea with my parents, and they told me that was not the best idea, and that we should sit down and discuss a better idea.  I decided I wanted to prove them wrong.  Fast forward a couple of months, and I am struggling to get anything done on the project.  That night, I told my parents that my idea would not work, and they just gave me that ""I-told-you-so"" look.  From there, we devised a plan where I would instead help the volunteers on the Blue Ridge Parkway.  Right now, my project is going great, and I am close to crossing the finish line of completion.  From that, I learned that you need to take advice of others because, in my case, my parents knew what they were talking about.  If multiple people tell you that something is not the right choice, then you should probably reconsider.  That was a life lesson I needed to learn, but from seeking advice from more than one person, you learn many life lessons.  "
8696	From my experience of failure from my school project, I learned that even though you think your idea sounds good, you should still be open to improvement.  My decision on buying something I wanted taught me opportunity cost.  From asking people for advice, you can learn may valuable things that will assist you.  Not only do these decisions affect a singular situation, but they can be applied to life very easily.  Now, if I am interested in purchasing anything, I always weigh the options, and ask others what the best thing to do would be.  I learned that skill from asking people for advice.  These are the lessons that are learned first hand.  You do not just read them in a book, but instead, you are taught by experience and others. 
8697	After asking for advice from numerous people, you ultimately decide that you want to take your brother with you to Disney World.  Though those people you did not choose may feel bummed out, you know you made a good, educated choice because you took advice not just from one person, but from many.  If you had only asked one person, they could have told you to take your grandfather, dog, cousin, son, etc.  Instead, asking many people gave you a better grasp on the situation, ultimately allowing you to determine the best choice is to take your brother.  Asking many people for advice before making a decision is a good choice because you can examine other people's opinions on the situation, figure out what the best choice is by finding the most common answer, and learn many life lessons.  So the next time you face a difficult choice, ask more than one person for advice before coming up with your verdict. 
8698	While walking the halls of a high school building during the winter, one can hear sneezing, coughing, and the constant blowing of noses. Students walk the halls half dead and slouched over. They come to school sick because missing a day of school can be catastrophic to their grades. In the past 40 or so years, most high school students have gone from taking one or two AP level courses, to six or seven. These fast paced classes can do wonders for a grade point average, or they can ruin it. AP classes are so fast paced, missing a day of school means missing vital learning time. By the time sick students get back on their feet, their class has probably moved on to another unit 
8699	Providing students with a way to take classes from home would reduce the amount of sick students in school and help them to stay on task, no matter their location 
8700	Schools have become cesspools for diseases like strep, the flu, and colds. Students come to school sick because they believe they have to, and in some cases they are right. Missing school means makeup work, which is a task most students would want to avoid. Having double the amount of work while simultaneously getting over an illness causes sleepless nights of stress and anxiety. As a way to avoid makeup work, students have started to come while sick. The sickness will spread throughout the school and cause outbreaks, more students will come sick to keep up with schoolwork 
8701	The best way to stop this is through distance learning. Through video chats students will be able to keep up with their learning and work while sick or injured 
8702	Distance learning will keep kids at home and the spread of germs will be stopped. Students will also no longer have to stay up late to teach themselves difficult material. Distance learning is the best solution to the epidemic of sick students in schools. 
8703	More time. That is something very student wants. Colleges are no longer looking for just good grades, they want someone who made varsity in their sport, is well rounded in their club choices, works a solid job, and has given back to their community. If you look at the average day of a high school student, you will see they start with morning club meetings, usually at 8 A.M, then at 9:15, about seven hours of school. At 4:03 P.M. most will go to athletic practice for three to four hours, they'll get home at 8 or 9 P.M. and then sit down with two to three hours of homework. They'll sleep at 12 A.M. or later and wake up at 7 A.M. the next day to do it all over again. Most will volunteer or go to a part time job over the weekend. 
8704	So when exactly does a student have free time? The answer is easy. Never. Distance learning will solve that. 
8705	Almost all students have a study hall during the day, an hour and a half to just do homework, through distance learning that study hall turns into an opportunity. Students could grab food with their friends, get ahead in their classes, hold club meetings online, or even get some rest. The format of distance learning allows students a more flexible schedule, they can sit in on a video chat while cleaning their room. Distance learning will help students to free up time out of their day and make them less stressed. 
8706	Both of those ideas, however, are false. Most high school students do not put in the effort to dress nicely for school everyday already, they would rather be comfortable then look nice. Through video chatting, students have the opportunity to interact with their peers and teachers, everyone needs social interaction and distance learning takes that into account. Many students find it easier to learn while sitting at a desk or table, both of which are very common in any household, therefore, students lazing around in bed while learning is highly unrealistic. 
8707	Distance learning is a solution to the large amount of sick students and high levels of stress. By giving them more free time and a place to work on school from home, distance learning allows students to have a more enjoyable school experience. Many students will agree that there is just not enough time in the day to get all their work done, distance learning will provide them with a way to adequately keep up with studies while giving them time to work on other tasks. Schools have progressed to become more difficult as time has passed, causing the systems to become outdated. Students are unhappy with the way schools are currently run, its time for a change. 
8708	Have you ever asked someone for advice on a certain issue and listened to how they told you to respond, only to realize they had no idea what they were talking about? I personally have, and know many people who also have gone through the same thing. 
8709	When you ask one person for advice, you aren't aware if they are familiar with issues like the one you approached them with, and wether or not they know how to respond to it properly 
8710	. Asking only one person for advice also doesn't give you options. It narrows your mindset, so you only see one side of the issue. 
8711	it broadens you're mindset, 
8712	you have more than one solution/ more than one perspective, 
8713	it allows you to learn from other people.  
8714	When you ask multiple people for advice on an issue, you are probably going to get different answers from all of them because they are all different from each other and have different views on how you should approach the issue. It helps you see all sides of the issue, including ones you might not want to look at. Also, when you hear what everyone has to say about the issue and how you respond, you start having better understanding of the issue and the other sides of it. Asking more than one person for advice and listening to what everyone has to say also increases the chances of you making a good choice. When you listen to everyone and take some time to think through the issue, you obviously are going to make a better choice than when you just wing it and do whatever you feel.  
8715	Having more than one solution gives you no limitations. You have a choice and options on how you would like to react to the problem or decision you are trying to make. Also by seeing other perspectives, you can make good choices with the options you have and know how to pick the best choice. For example, you own a company and you get an offer with a lot of money to cut down the forest and build a mall in its place. You don't know what your answer is going to be and you just don't know how to make that decision. You go to ask your friends and family about what they think you should do. They give you multiple answers to the decision and multiple points of view. Your mom says yes, take the deal, there are so many trees in the world, you cutting down a 100 isn't going to affect anything. Your friend says no, don't take the deal, there are animals and creatures that depend on those trees for survival. Your cousin says take the deal, but change the coniditons, build the mall somewhere else. You hadn't even thought about the animals that depend on those trees! Now by having all these new perspectives and all these new choices, you are able to make the best decision for the enviroment and for yourself. 
8716	Maybe somebody has already had to make a choice like this before and made the right choice and wants you to learn. Maybe somebody has already had to make this choice and made the wrong choice and wants you to learn from their mistake. It doesn't matter, even if they've never had to make a decision like this before, they can still have good input and information about the topic. Learning from others mistakes and gaining knowledge and information increases your chances of making a good decision because you learn what will happen if you make a decision. Some might argue that only you know what is best for yourself and you should make your own decisions. I agree with them, but you have to keep in mind that I'm not suggesting that other people make the decision for you, only that you you get multiple views and hear what others have to say. In the end, the choice is truly yours, but listening to what people have to say can help make it easier to make the right decision. 
8717	Making a decision is extremely difficult and stressful, but asking others for input and advice on the issue can help you make the right choice because it widens your mindset, you end up having more than one solution and more than one perspective on the topic, and you learn from others past and gain information and knowledge from it. You don't want to be in the position where you ask only one person for their advice and listen to them, only to realize they really didn't know what they were saying. The one guranteed way to prevent that from happening is by getting multiple peoples opinions. Now, next time you are faced with a huge choice to make, I hope you ask more than one person about what they think you should do.  
8718	Not everyone can do things without any help. Some people need others to support them. When you make difficult choices, you always want advice before it actually happens. Sometimes people aren't sure of themselves, and they might not think that only one person is trustworthy enough. 
8719	People talk to more than one person for advice because they want to make a better choice. They want to hear what other people have experienced, their personal feelings about the situation, the pros and cons, how they view everything, so they don't feel anxious about it as much. 
8720	Everyone has lived a different life, whether you were rich or poor, healthy or ill, no one has lived the same life as another. When you need help making a choice, you talk to people because they haven't lived exactly like you. They haven't lived exactly like anyone. I would need to know what other people have spectated or experienced when they have had to make a choice similar to mine because I don't want one person to help. I want more people to help advise me because they might have experienced more than I have. You get more wisdom to make your choice when you hear more experiences. They view things differently than someone else 
8721	Getting more than one opinion makes sure you don't hear just point of view. It opens your eyes to many other things instead of being one-sided. 
8722	People have anxiety when making hard choices. They always think of all the things that could go wrong in the process. Talking to one person doesn't always help, some people might think their opinion isn't enough. I don't always trust my opinion or my judgment. I need others to make me feel safe and secure, so that I can really trust what I'm doing. I don't want to make a choice when I'm anxious because then I will regret it later. I know I wouldn't be in the right mindset to make a choice if I'm anxious, so talking to more than one person would relieve most of my stress and anxiety. If you talk to only one person, you only get one of everything. You don't know everything that might happen, so you don't really know if you're doing the best thing. No one should make a choice when they are not sure about it. They should always feel that their choice was the best that they could have done 
8723	Putting multiple minds together to think of pros and cons will give spectacular outcomes. 
8724	Sometimes I need all the facts, pros, and cons. My mind and others needs help to come up with these pros and cons because we have a lot on our minds already about making the decision itself. We would be preparing to actually do it. I know I wouldn't be able to do it all on my own. I know I would need multiple people to help me because sometimes people aren't feeling their best. They might not be able to help you find all the pros and cons, but bringing together multiple people ensures that you get the facts you want. I wouldn't want to make a choice without knowing the cons of it. I want to know all the bad things that might happen even if it's for the best so that I can prepare for it. You would also get more detailed and possibly more profound pros and cons. You get all the facts when you work with more people, because more minds means more knowledge. 
8725	Everyone needs a support system, whether it's family or friends. When you ask for advice, you go to multiple people for help. You ask them for things to help you make your choice. I want people behind me to help me after I make my choice. If the choice knocks me down in any way, I want people to be there to support me. If I talk to multiple people, I know all of those people will help me if I fall. No one wants to feel alone after their choice. I would only make a tough choice if I was certain I had at least one person to help me. If I talked to more than one person, I know at least one of them will be able to support me because they helped me. They know what I was going through when I was making this choice 
8726	Talking to more than one person ensures that you have at least one person to fall back on after you made your choice. 
8727	If you talk to more people, you trust them and yourself even more. You know what you're up against and you know what will come out of it. 
8728	As a consultant that helps other students with writing, I see many strange things from people with half finished essays. The one that grabs the trophy, however, was incredibly ridiculous. At the beggining of a students work, they talked about how Abraham Lincoln and George Washington had a conversation. Not only did it have nothing to do with their central theme of Lincoln being the best president, but I gaurentee you they did not have multiple people help review their work. We did get them the help they needed, and through multiple peoples advice, it was transformed into a pretty good persuasive essay. When searching for help, whether it's with editing a school paper, or understanding concepts that are confusing for you in a difficulty subject, it's always important to look for more than one opinion. If you were to only ask a singe individual, their response could be flawed for many, many reasons 
8729	When you consult multiple people, however, the room for error decreases significantly. 
8730	. However, if you were to consult multiple people, the scope of the bias would be severely limited. 
8731	When asking people for advice, you must always consider whether what they're saying is actually true. 
8732	Bias is incredibly important to weed out, but often fact checks can also help root out some bias too. Biased individuals are more likely to lie or include misleading statements in their advice. By discovering false or misleading statements, you can also discover hidden bias in the individual. None of us are always right, so people have mistaken opinions about many topics. When looking for help, you always run the risk of including false information from a well meaning individual, as you have nobody to fact check them against. You have no way to tell if what they're saying is true, and, if they deliver it more confidently, you may already be convinced it's a fact. Luckily, when you ask multiple people, and fact check all of their statements against one another, you can assure yourself a significantly smaller chance of obtaining false information. Although fact checking against other people can certainly help, there are other ways, including searching on Google or looking it up with a textbook, to fact check correctly. However, some statements are simply opinions and cannot be fact checked, only compared to other people's opinions. 
8733	 When attempting to rephrase a sentence that sounds strange or incorrect, or when trying to add more detail and glamour to an otherwise boring sentence, there is no right or wrong answer 
8734	Certain techniques may work better or worse, but there is never a fix all type solution. So when taking advice from someone who, for example, is helping you edit your paper, some things they say you cannot fact check with Google or a textbook. If you were to only consult this individual, they would have full control, and may make suggestions that aren't the best for your paper. That's why, especially when dealing with highly opinionated topics like rephrasing sentences and adding additional detail, its crucial to consult multiple people and make sure most agree with your changes to ensure they're the best for your paper. Oftentimes in a writing help after school club I'm a part of, we have to deal with problems like these where students need more detail, but there's really no right and wrong way to phrase the sentence. That's why we consult each other to make sure every change we make is for the good of that persons writing. 
8735	Wednesdays, after school, I work as a consultant to the writing center. In the club, younger students, usually from seventh grade, come to get help with their writing from older, more experienced students. Many times, seventh graders come in with half finished essays that could barely be considered rough drafts, but as it turns out they've already turned them in and need to re-write them for a higher grade. The process can be difficult, and sometimes grueling if the seventh grader doesn't want to and cooperate, but I still love consulting. Working there is a joy, but one of the things that really makes us able to go above and beyond to help other students is the ability to cross check with other consultants and work together. Often, seventh graders are assigned only one consultant to help them with their work. However, like I've said above, one persons opinion can definitely be flawed 
8736	This is why we employ many talented consultants, so if one doesn't know what to do or accidentally makes a mistake, others can catch it and further assist them. 
8737	Asking multiple people for advice, no mater the topic, is always an important and crucial step of the writing process. By asking multiple people, you assure the least bias possible, the highest form of fact checking, the best way to phrase sentences and other similar opinionated subjects, and you ensure none of those you seek advice from made mistakes.  
8738	People ask for advice, because sometimes they can't make the choice on their own. It's also not a bad thing to do when you are stuck and need some advice from other people. When people make choices on their own and don't ask anyone for help, they tend to make a bad decision. Some people feel trapped when trying to ask someone they trust for advice, because they are scared about how they are going to react. So then they don't ask them and then the problem they were trying to solve turns into a even bigger problem then before. Then at the last moment they decide to tell or ask the person for advice when it's already too late. Sometimes it can create another problem that they are going to have to solve, or it solves the problem 
8739	"""LET ME GO!"" Generic_Name shouted. Generic_Name was struggling to escape the breath taking choke hold she was in. Her mind flooded with horrendous thoughts. Generic_Name's date was trying to kidnap her. While she was fighting for her life,all she could think about was how she regretted meeting up with this dangerous,strange man. In hope to find a partner, Generic_Name downloaded a dating app. She was aware of the risks of chatting with and meeting strangers, but she was not bothered by it. Generic_Name was going to seek opinions from her close friends, but she knew they would not approve. Generic_Name felt that since she was an adult, it was her duty make her own decisions, and deal with the consequences without the validation of others. She soon found out that her decision was a bad idea. Generic_Name should have asked for her friends' opinions in making the decision to meet up with a stranger from a dating app. "
8740	by introducing their mind to different points of views 
8741	seeing how options weigh out, 
8742	gaining wisdom from others. 
8743	While making a decision, it is important to seek advice from others. Being introduced to how different people would handle a situation or make a choice, can help a person make a more beneficial choice. For example, if Generic_Name would have asked three of her friends how they felt about the dating app, the scary situation in the beginning possibly could have been prevented. One friend could have told her to be careful and bring protection just in case, the other may have suggested to meet up in a public area with a numerous amount of people, and the other friend could have listed all the dangers about meeting with strangers. A couple of her friends could have mentioned to her how they would meet up with someone safely, and the other friend could have opened her mind to scary perspectives of meeting with a man online. Generic_Name would have made a better choice if she would have considered the different points of views. Be aware of who you take advice from. Always make sure the person that is introducing you to different point of views is someone you can put your trust into. 
8744	To further explain,when you weigh out options you are determining how one decision or choice you make can be more beneficial than the other choice or decision. If Generic_Name would have went to a trusting adult or relative, they could have informed her about the pros and cons of dating apps. They could have informed her about the number of kidnaps or deaths that relate to dating apps,or the low number of striving relationships. With that knowledge, Generic_Name could have weighed out her options. She could have used that knowledge to make a better choice. For example, Generic_Name's options were to be single and discontinue the use of the dating app, or meet a stranger and possibly start a risky relationship. If the cons seemed worse on the ''meet a stranger and possibly start a risky relationship'' side, than she would have weighed out her options, and chosen to be single. When you weigh out your options, make sure you have full knowledge on all possible choices. 
8745	When someone shares their wisdom with you, it can alter the way you think or perceive things. All it takes is a wise individual to share their thoughts and advice with you, for you to make a better choice. Generic_Name could have possibly talked to her mother, or a wise person in her life and asked them for their intake or thoughts about her dating app situation. Gaining advice from someone who is wiser than you can make you deeply consider your choices. If a wise person in Generic_Name's life would have told her not to force relationships or just wait on your true love to appear, she would have deleted the app and been patient. When you look up to someone, especially if their wise, you take what they say into a deeper understanding. When gaining wisdom from others,take it into deep consideration. 
8746	"Sparkling lights filled the room while blush colored flowers made a trail down the isle. The room had a peachy aroma. People slowly entered the church and the murmurs of voices were filling the air. Generic_Name was in the back dressing room getting her large, white gown fitted on her body. She was getting married to the love of her life. Generic_Name was a dove. Generic_Name was graceful and delicate. Nobody could ruin her day""Generic_Name its almost time to walk,"" Generic_Name's father called out. She could hear the soft music playing. Butterflies fluttered around in her stomach. She could not believe how almost four months ago she was going to meet up with a man from a dating website. The thought made her body cringe. If she would have went on that date, she would have never met her soon to be husband. Generic_Name was in love and happier than she had ever been. She was so glad she listened to the opinions and advice from her friends and family. "
8747	Introducing someones mind to different points of views, seeing how options weigh out, and gaining wisdom from others are all ways seeking multiple opinions can help a person make a better choice. 
8748	Have you ever had a really important decision you had to make? Did you feel overwhelmed because you didn't know what you should do? Asking for help or advise from people such as friends and family around you can really help alleviate all that stress. Most people encounter big decisions often throughout their lives, so getting advise from numerous people can help you get more input on something, and may end up helping you make a final decision. 
8749	One way seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is that by asking more than one person, they can get more input. 
8750	Asking numerous people can be a huge help when making an important decision. Not only are people getting different ideas of what they may want to do, they can also get advise from people who may be more experienced than themselves. For example, if someone was debating on which college they should apply to, they may end up asking people such as older siblings or parents for advise because they may have more experience with that matter. By asking multiple people, you can get multiple ideas, each of them being different in their own way. By getting more people's input, you may be able to start to make your own choice about the matter because of the advise you've gotten. 
8751	Another way seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is by not getting any biased opinions. 
8752	By asking more than one person for advise on a subject, they can get more than one new idea that isn't one of their own. This way, they can get more than one person's thoughts on the decision, and have different ideas on it. For example, if someone were trying to make a decision on what sport they may want to tryout for at school, they could possibly ask their friends and family about which they should choose. However, they should also ask people like classmates and teachers, as they may have their own ideas, and won't give the person any biased ideas or information. Friends and family can have a great deal of influence on people, so it's important to always get people's thoughts that are on the outside. This will make it to where there's a greater chance of the decision maker not being biased, as they've heard numerous people's thoughts, and can make their own decision off of that.  
8753	A final way seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is by being more prepared about the choice they're going to make. 
8754	The decision maker can use all the advise they've gotten from different people to make their own choice, and feel better prepared. They will be more focused as they know what they want to do, and will feel more confident and less overwhelmed. Feeling less overwhelmed can be a big help as the person doesn't have to be so worried, so they won't have any distractions from making the best possible decision. For example, if someone is trying to decide what kind of car they want to get, and they've gotten advise from numerous people, they can make a better choice when picking. They'll know exactly what they want, as they've heard many thoughts from the people around them, and so they can make their final decision.  
8755	Did any of the schools you attended as a child offer distance learning? Would you be interested in participating in distance learning? Schools are now offering distance learning as an option for their students. Distance learning allows students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Schools believe that there are benefits to distance learning, however there are various problems with the system of distance learning 
8756	and they are more likely to get easily distracted when learning from home.  
8757	One way that distance learning would not be beneficial for students is because it will not prepare them for the set up of college 
8758	In almost all colleges, the classes offered are in large lecture halls where you are face to face with the teacher and other students, and not separated by a screen. By participating in distance learning students may not be prepared for face to face interaction with their teacher and the other students. For example, my brother, who is now a senior in college, participated in a system similar to distance learning while he was in school. After having participated in online and video conferencing classes for almost all of his school career, he had a much harder time adjusting to the college style of teaching than the other students, from his same high school, that did not participate in distance learning. Another way that distance learning would not help students prepare for the set up of college is that the students that participate in distance learning will have trouble adjusting to having to leave their house to attend class. In college classes are not offered inside of dorms and students will have to travel outside of their living area. If students do not practice taking classes outside of their home in high school they may feel uncomfortable learning in an unfamiliar environment and that could affect their learning abilities when they get to college. 
8759	Another downside to the distance learning system is that students would not have daily interaction or learn how to work with their peers. 
8760	In school you meet many new people from around your town that may have very different cultural or ethnic backgrounds. If students were to participate in distance learning, although they would meet various other peers through activities like sports, clubs, or their hobbies, they would not meet as many people as they would if they were also in a classroom with twenty to thirty other kids. Because of this limited interaction with other kids their age, these students who participate in distance learning may not learn how to interact and collaborate with other students. For example, my brother had a difficult time making friends in college because he had little experience interacting with other children that he didn't already know and have a relationship with. He also struggled in group projects because he had not participated in one since elementary school, when he began distance learning. Not learning how to collaborate with others can be detrimental for a student because that will be a major part of their lives after they finish school. Whether they use the skill of interacting with other people in their future job, or even just to make to new friends after moving to a new town, the skill of interacting with others is very valuable and important to possess.  
8761	The final reason that distance learning is not beneficial to students is because it allows students to become more easily distracted 
8762	In a student's home they have access to toys and electronics such as phones, televisions, and computers that can take their attention away from learning. However if students took classes in a school building they would not have access to as many of these distracting things, and they would also have a teacher that would be able to take any distractions they find away from them. Another way that distance learning would allow students to become easily distracted is because their is no other students around to keep them on task. By taking their classes inside of a school building students would be surrounded by other students who are also doing work. Being surrounded by other students who are also doing their work will help motivate students to continue to focus on their own assignments. Personally, I prefer to do my homework at school, in my study hall period, as opposed to completing it at home. I would rather do my work at school because I am surrounded by other students that motivate me to finish my work, and also their is less distractions around me. One specific example of how doing my work in school benefits me is when I had to complete my history project on Andrew Jackson. Instead of working on my project during my study hall period, I decided to take a nap and told myself that I would be able to finish the project at home. However, when I got home, instead of working on my project, I was immediately distracted by the television and ended up watching a six episodes of one television show instead of finishing my project. When I received my grade back on the project I saw that I had received a C+ instead of my usual A. If I would have completed my project in study hall I would have been more focused on doing the project, due to the other students also working on assignments around me, and I would have received a better grade.  
8763	Distance learning is not beneficial to students because it does not prepare them for the set up of college, they would not be able to learn how to interact and collaborate with their peers, and they are more likely to be easily distracted when learning from home. Although distance learning may provide some benefits to learners who may struggle with learning in a classroom setting, it will ultimately affect them in a negative way in the future.  
8764	Imagine having a problem that no matter how hard you try, you can't figure out a way to solve it. Many of this have this issue often that it recalls to getting advice. Advice can help us in situations that we can't find an answer to our problems. Whether its asking a friend, a family member, coworker, neighbor, or anyone else that you can trust to give you a reasonably good answer to your problem. 
8765	Many people ask more than just one person for advice, seeking different ways to solve their problem, and that results to making good choices 
8766	Seeking advice from multiple opinions can help people make better choices because they can view different viewpoints from others 
8767	have a different understanding of the problem 
8768	can find various way to solve the problem.  
8769	This can benefit the person because it can help them find more easier ways to solve their situation. When people have problems and ask more than one person for advice, it can result into find more ways to solve the situation because the person can find solutions that can either cause more harm to the persons life by making a bad choice, or just finding more than one choices that could the persons lives in many different ways. Having more than one solution to the problem is a good thing because when you try to solve the problem and it doesn't work out, you can always find more ways to try to solve the problem until you find a way that it works out for you. Finding multiple choices to solve a problem also ties in with different viewpoints and a different understanding of the problem. When these are applied, they can both help the person find multiple solutions because with different viewpoints, they can get others opinions and figure out an answer there, and with a different understanding of the problem, the person can find a deeper meaning of the problem, and find a easier solution there. Finding multiple ways to solve a problem can help lead people to better choices because when receiving advice from other people, it can lead to having multiple ways to solve the problem. 
8770	Only asking one person for their opinion might cause you to make the wrong choice, and asking multiple people will give you a higher chance to make the right decision. A couple weeks ago, my civics teacher gave our class a project that was due the next day, but I had a basketball game the same day which would end at 8:30pm. Since I didn't know what to do I asked my friend who told me to go to my basket ball game and try to finish the project at home. After she told me this I asked my civics teacher and a couple of other friends who advised me to skip my basket ball game so that I could finish the project without any stress. Since most of the people I asked advise from told me to skip my basket ball game which then made me feel like it was the right decision I did which caused me to finish my project without any stress. Other than assuring yourself that you are making the right decision, you could also change your opinion. 
8771	Yesterday I asked multiple friends of mine for advice on what sport I should do. I could either do soccer which is every day from 4-8pm, or golf which is on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Sundays for 5-6:30pm.  I really wanted to play soccer, but most of my friends told me that I would be stressed since it's right after school and every day. They told me that golf would be less stressful and will give me time to finish schoolwork or have time to spend with friends and family. Because of this, I chose to play golf which caused me to feel less stressed and gave me free time to spend with family and friends. Seeking advice from more than one person will allow you to not feel confused. 
8772	Asking multiple people for advice will assure you that you are either making the wrong or right decision. A couple days ago I wasn't sure if I should go to the library to study for my science test during lunch, or study in civics class which is right before my science class. After asking multiple people for their advice, they all said that studying during lunch time in the library would be less stressful and not cause me to miss anything important in civics class. Since most of the people I asked told me to study during lunch time in the library, I went to study in the library and as a result I ended up getting an A on my science test. Therefore, asking multiple people for advice will help you feel less confused. 
8773	When you go shopping or are picking something out you often ask for multiple peoples advice. Why do you do this? Well it's mostly because you want the reassurance from others. It is a natural thing that we all do. For instance last September my sister went homecoming dress shopping. She brought a bunch of people so we could all give our opinions. But at the end of the day does it really help? 
8774	"The first person my sister asked for there opinion was our Grandma. After a while of my sister coming out in dresses the first thing I noticed was my Grandma always asking ""Well what do you think of it?"" before giving her opinion. I think this is a very good way to give your opinion without hurting any ones feelings. You are asking how the feel about the dress before you put your thought in. But there are some disadvantages to that. Let's say she walks out of the dressing room in a dress my Grandma really doesn't like and she asked my sister how she feels about it and my sister says she loves it. Then you have a hard decision to make. Do you say you like it so you don't hurt her feelings or are you going to be honest and say you don't like it with the possibility of making her upset. "
8775	even if I don't like to hear that they don't like it I would rather someone be honest with me then just lie and say they like it. 
8776	"The next opinion my sister asked for was my mom. I knew even before this trip started that my mom was going to have a very strong opinion on each dress. And I was not mistaken. Each dress came with a ""thats too short"" or ""that shape does not flatter you and the color is to bright."" I could easily tell this was overwhelming my sister and stressing her out a lot. And that is one reason why getting multiple opinions can be bad but again sometimes after my mom said that my sister would look in the mirror and realize well maybe it is too short. I think this is one thing that happens a lot. You will put on something you like and when you show it to someone they point out something you maybe didn't think about or realize. One example is when I was at Target one time and I picked out a shirt that I really liked and when I showed my mom she remembered that I already had that shirt. If she had not been there I would have never known that and I would have gotten the exact same shirt I already had. "
8777	even though my mom can be brutally honest at least she can point out a lot of things you didn't notice and help you pick the right dress at the end of the day. 
8778	The last opinion my sister got and the most important one was Beyonce. She has been a family friend for a while and my sister has always really loved her fashion sense. So when Beyonce heard that my sister needed to go dress shopping she was more then happy to come along. Her job was to help my sister pick out the dresses to try on and then give her opinion. Her way of giving her opinion was just to first point out all the things she liked about the dress and then something that my sister maybe want to consider. I think Beyonce was the best at giving her advice because she has to do it all the time with her music and what she wears for all of her performances. 
8779	it can be very hard to get lots of opinions and not be overly influenced and not listen to your own opinion. 
8780	After this very long and tiring journey I came to the conclusion that ever opinion is important ans really can help you make the best decision. I would highly recommend getting an opinion from everyone you can but make sure that you listen to your own opinion too. It can be especially hard with really big decisions and so for those I would still get a lot of advice from others but also take time to consider each option and like about the pros and cons.                 
8781	seeking multiple opinions allows for better decisions to be made. 
8782	it allows us to view an issue from multiple angles, 
8783	allows for a more unbiased response, 
8784	hearing several opinions can change our thinking on a certain subject for the better. 
8785	Hearing several sides of a story or particular topic, can often have an affect on our decisions. Say you and a friend get involved in an argument and you aren't sure how to handle it. You ask some friends what to do. They explain that your friend is having a bad day and some family issues at home. Rather than be upset with your friend, you decide to do everything in your power to help your friend out. Hearing other angles or sides of a story changes the way we view an issue or person, therefore plays a key role in the making of that decision or series of decisions. 
8786	An example would be, a friend of yours pulls a ruthless prank on you. Instead of laughing along with your friend, you become upset and infuriated. You make a split second decision to retaliate. Several people encourage you to inform your friend that their actions bothered you, rather than getting even. Hearing the same thing from several people can often affect the way we view a topic. Rather than repeating those infuriating actions towards your friend, you explain to that individual that you were offended and deeply upset by their prank. When we decide in our minds that something negative is a good idea, or our only option, hearing differently from multiple people with our best interest at heart becomes a deciding factor in the choices we make daily. 
8787	asking multiple people for advice is more efficient that asking only one. Hearing several opinions allows for neutral, unbiased advice. Receiving advice from several friends, teachers, peers, or family members can play a rather important role on our thought process on a given topic in a positive way. And viewing all sides of a story, instead of just our own, can allow for better, more beneficial choices to be made. 
8788	Whenever there is a roadblock in life, many people feel limited to who they can ask for help. They do not know that there is a tremendous number of others surrounding them ready to put forth advice. There are always people somewhere who would be willing to help with a problem. Getting help is the smartest choice to make when in need of help. 
8789	Talking to multiple people will never be the wrong choice, as it will almost always provide benefits for both parties. 
8790	new perspectives are provided 
8791	decisions are rethought 
8792	new ideas are formed. 
8793	There is no arguing that no two alike people walk on this planet. With different people, comes an uncountable number of differing opinions on topics worldwide 
8794	When multiple opinions are acquired, a great sea of new perspectives begins to flow. 
8795	In many situations, judgment can easily be corrupted. This can be caused by stress, deficient energy, or maybe just a busy schedule. With a corrupted field of judgment, decisions cannot be made with complete logic. In less then two minutes, someone's life can be changed. That is all it takes for a good or bad decision to be made. A great example is speeding up to a yellow traffic light rather than slowing down. There is a risk of crashing or getting pulled over, but also getting to the destination faster. The right decision may lead to a beneficial addition to the day. However, the wrong decision may lead to something grave. When making a decision, advice is a great way to try and stay on the right path 
8796	By asking multiple people, the pieces of advice may start to persuade someone to not make a certain decision or to make a different choice 
8797	In some of situations, the original plan is not always the best solution. Even if advice is given from multiple people, their advice might not be what is wanted 
8798	As advice is given, sometimes combinations of many different opinions is the best suited for a specific person and topic. 
8799	To be more specific, if none of the advice given is liked, then new ideas begin to spark. For instance, someone is deciding whether to buy a big box of cookies or not and they ask two people for advice. One person says to buy it, and the other says not to. If neither idea sounds right, the idea to buy a smaller box surfaces which is both pieces of advice combined. If only one piece of advice was taken then, the decision could have been completely different and had a different consequence. 
8800	In conclusion, making the right decision is crucial for many aspects in life. Some of these aspects include happiness and success. In order to do that, advice from multiple people is needed. Advice is always beneficial from everyone when it comes to making the right choice. In some situations, advice can be more crucial than others but it is needed in all types of problems. It can be from friends, family, or anyone who could help give reputable advice. When multiple people put forth opinions, new perspectives are provided, decisions are rethought, and new ideas are formed. 
8801	Although some may believe otherwise, students can benefit from being able to attend online class from home 
8802	students can manage their time 
8803	can work at their own pace. 
8804	First of all, students will benefit from online class because they can manage their own time. 
8805	For instance, my friend Generic_Name, who is a dancer and soccer player, takes classes online, so she has more time to attend her ballet classes and club soccer practices everyday. Because Generic_Name does not have to get dressed or commute to and from school, she can focus that additional time to dedicate to her interest in dance and sports while still maintaining her education 
8806	In addition, after my ACL and meniscus surgery, I had to take a week off of school to recover, which is a difficult amount of time to miss when being enrolled in all AP and honors courses. In preparation for my surgery, I asked all my teachers for notes and assignments that I would be missing, however, I only anticipated to miss half a week, so I was two days behind on my school work. With online classes, I could have managed more time to allow for a proper recovery and would not have fallen behind. Thus, online classes are useful in facilitating the growth of other interests and compensating for states of emergency where one may not be able to physically attend school. 
8807	Secondly, students will benefit from attending class online because they can work at their own pace. 
8808	In U.S. History, for instance, my teacher Generic_Name would talk through the notes very quickly, so it was difficult for me to keep up, especially since I am a slow writer. Fortunately, Generic_Name makes the powerpoints available on blackboard, so I use that during class, but I am so invested in trying to write down all the notes that I miss the important information that he was explaining. In this situation, it would have been beneficial to attend that class from home because I could listen to his lecture intently and then take the notes afterward, which I would not have been able to do in class because Generic_Name disapproves of people not taking notes. 
8809	Additionally, precalculus is a particularly easy class for me, so I often find myself sitting at my desk doing nothing after finishing the practice problems early. If I were to attend class online, I would be able to finish the lesson quickly and efficiently, shortening a 90 minute lesson to 30. Therefore, online courses enables students to utilize the time needed to take in and comprehend a lesson. 
8810	Some may disagree that students should be able to attend class online because students may easily get distracted at home, making their learning ineffective. 
8811	For instance, in my Spanish class, the students were extremely loud and talkative because their was a substitute teacher, which affected me, a student who actually wanted to learn, since my mind could not properly process the information with all the noise in the room. When I got home from school, I worked on the assignment that I couldn't finish in class and was able to do it in only fifteen minutes because I could think more clearly with nothing but the serene silence filling up the room 
8812	Furthermore, in AP psychology, I sit next to my best friend Generic_Name, and, despite my best efforts to pay attention in class, I get distracted because the two of us talk and goof around, whereas, at home, I can concentrate on my work for hours when I am alone. Overall, distractions like friends and disruptive classmates can make learning in school difficult, so taking class from home in isolation may be even more effective than physically being in school. 
8813	To conclude, students can reap many benefits from online classes that would facilitate their growth both in and out of school. Attending class online gives the student control of learning in a way that is preferrable to them, which is important because then students will comprehend more and learn effectively, and gives the opportunity to explore interests with the extra time at hand to grow as an individual. It would be an absolute waste of resources if schools failed to take advantage of such technologies that could improve students' education and well-being. Not only is the availability of online classes beneficial to the students, but it is useful in an emergency such as a threat of a school shooting, which is unfortunately a prominent issue and possibility in the modern world, or a viral outbreak. Technology has changed drastically from when the school system was first established and normalized and so has society, so it's imperative that the schools take action to adapt to the changing world, especially now in the wake of a global pandemic.  
8814	Every human being has been in the situation of needing or receiving help from someone.  Whether it's asking advice from your grandpa, mom or brother, as a human, none of us are perfect and we need to receive advice from someone.  Seeking advice from one person is great, but have you ever thought about why people ask more than one person for advice? 
8815	Asking for more than one persons advice is not only helpful, but it will give you a more depth and clear mindset. 
8816	People's advice matters and I can say it makes an impact on my personal life, everyone is different and it can help you form an opinion. 
8817	Asking for multiple inputs for the topic of advice, hits very close to home for me.  After I moved from the United Kingdom to United States of America.  I was sad and had the feeling of anxiety of talking to and meeting new people as I had made so many friends in the UK and no one in America wanted to talk to be or be my friend.  I felt like I wasn't meant to be in this world, but then my dad took me into our formal dining room and sat me down.  I talked to him about the whole situation and told him about my worries and asked him for advice.  He gave me advice on how to cope and to deal with situation.  I had suddenly felt a lot better.  I then started to be more open about my feelings and talked to multiple people like my school consular, mom, brother and even a classmate.  Now I have a lot of friends that I can rely and depend on because of the advice I took from multiple people.  Therefore, asking for advice from more than one person can change or have a huge impact on someones life. 
8818	The more people that give advice, the better your decision will be.  When asking multiple people for advice or anything, the person is forming a better decision or result whereas asking advice from one person, the person is only listening to one opinion and it is not as good or reliable.  Listening to more than one person for advice will help the person form a plan that they could use for not only for one specific situation but multiple events.  If multiple inputs are given to you on a specific topic, you can use the skills and tactics that the person learned from the people who gave them advice to apply while making a decision of when and how to satisfy the problem.  Multiple people giving advice can help the person form an opinion on a topic.  For example, if the person is asking for advice on politics from an elder or several other people, by listening to them, the person can form a valid or personal opinion that he or she likes.  Therefore, getting advice from multiple people can help you make a decision a proper and valid decision. 
8819	When asking multiple people for advice, you have to keep in mind everyone is different.  For example, when asking your mom, dad, brother or grandpa for their advice on politics, they are all going to have different opinions and answers, and it's the job of the person to make and pick a decision that they personally agree with.  Multiple peoples opinion on something will help the person form a different perspective of a topic.  For example, several people giving the person advice on a topic of something like depression will help them find a different perspective of the topic like the bright side of it or that some people aren't as fortunate.  Everyone is different and people have multiple opinions on a topic or situation which can help them find more than one solution in the decision making process when asking for advice.  For example, if a person has an opinion on a topic, asking multiple people for advice can help them form new and different ideas that they can use to help formulate multiple opinions to help them use in finding a solution for a problem.  Therefore, everyone is different, and when asking for advice, multiple or different views will strengthen your thought and help you think diversely. 
8820	When someone is in desperate, urgent need of guidance, just one person may not have the answer. To achieve the most dependable help, one must access different sources. 
8821	Requesting many diverse perspectives will help a person make the best decision because it will present them with more options and suggest the logicality behind their own ideas.  
8822	As more assistance is sought out, more feedback will be received 
8823	Also, when given multiple thoughts, the ability is there for the seeker to choose which one they prefer. 
8824	Another example is the availability of compiling every resolution that is offered. There is no requirement for someone in distress to choose only one; therefor, it is always reasonable to form one's own method of progress using what they have already thought of as well as heard. This strategy will build a bridge between all helpful spoken words of helpers. 
8825	Considering this, the most effective conclusion is not one that comes only from the viewpoints of one person. 
8826	The motivation and speech that the scouter is presented with will question the reasoning for future actions that they would have tried to complete.  Additionally, only by pointing out the reasons certain things are better than another will anyone see why they truly are. Discussing specific matters with those who are around will open the door to the realization of the successes that have been a result before. These positives outweigh the negatives and compel people to utilize their processes.  Not to mention the experience that has created the viewpoints of others. From their own hardships and struggles, mentors will know what is a credible thing to go by. Being taught about the things these people went through will assure the listener that there are more rational things to do. Using the past decisions of elders as a format for one's own will offer assistance in the improvement of an open mind's supposed best way to solve a problem. 
8827	Finally, by explaining to others one's own plans, those who are willing to help can express the inevitable downfalls when proceeding with that plan. 
8828	To any given person, it is difficult to see the flaws in what they thought of to be one of the most magnificent things they had ever contemplated. It is much less difficult to recognize the fatalities that will arise from such things when the composer is not their own judge. By bringing awareness to these dangers and failures, both people can discover what causes the disadvantages and work to formulate something of better benefit.  Knowing the effects of countless diverse future and past attempts will encourage someone to rethink their own.  
8829	A reasonable method becomes clear when a young mind uses the chance to ponder numerous alternatives because they serve as additional viewpoints as well as the opportunity to find the stability in previously devised possibilities. In the end, what one thinks is best will be what they want to do. For their own well being, every source should be consulted and always thought over. 
8830	it benefits you by giving you a chance to learn from the experience of others, 
8831	view your situation in a different perspective, 
8832	learn more about your choices. 
8833	All of these are valuable assets that will help you later in life, and maybe even help others if they come to you for advice. 
8834	People who have had to make your decision before will have experience with what happened to them when they made the decision. This will help you try to find the result that will best benefit you. My friend Generic_Name always asks for the opinion of others when trying to make a decision. A great example of this is when she couldn't take a important test, but didn't know when she should make it up. She asked me what she should do, and I told her that when I missed a big test, I tried to find a solution with our teacher beforehand, like taking the test early, or a few days after the actual test date. Generic_Name knew she couldn't take the test early, as she had another activity taking up her time, but she went to our teacher and asked if she could take it later. Generic_Name figured out a solution by asking others for advice, and found the best choice for her using my experience. Now, she can also use both mine and her experience to make decisions later on inn life. Using my experience to find a solution is not the only way for Generic_Name to solve her problem though. She could have asked for a different perspective instead. 
8835	Different perspectives help others understand your problem so they can help you, and also you can now rearrange the pieces of your situation to find a solution. It's always better to look at your choices in a new perspective, because you might find it easier to choose the best one for you from that angle. When I was trying to decide which sleep-away camp I wanted to attend this summer, I had to ask my parents and my friends to decide. My parents told me that because one of the camps was extremely expensive, it would be better for me to go to the other one. My friends, on the other hand, told me that instead of choosing one or the other, I should go to a completely different camp, one that has the activities of both previous camps mentioned and cost less than each one. I did not know about this camp, and didn't even consider trying to find a camp with the benefits of both the ones I wanted to attend. But using my friends' wider perspectives, I was able to find a completely new and customized solution for me. They also could have provided important information about the new camp that I was not aware of to advise me on my decision. 
8836	Different people may know certain things about the decision that you need to make. Asking for advice from these people will allow you to gain this information and make a better choice. A study from Harvard University found that when given the choice, 99% of people chose to make a decision with advice from multiple strangers who has had to make the same decision before. Out of that 99%, 98% believed that the choice they made was the best for them. They also believed that the knowledge they gained from talking to the strangers was a big contributing factor to their success. This study shows how truly beneficial advice from others is. It not only helped people make the best decision possible, but also provided new information for the decision maker, who can now pass on that knowledge to others who need help from someone with experience. 
8837	when making a decision, asking for multiple opinions is extremely beneficial. 
8838	You can learn from the experience of others, choose the right choice more easily when looking at different solutions in a new perspective, and gain new information you can pass on to others, thus helping the whole process come full circle. It will benefit you greatly in the long run as well, as you can use anything you gain from these different opinions in future decision making processes. Clearly, it is always better for you to ask for a second opinion, no matter the decision. 
8839	"If its about what you want to wear today and you ask someone they have given you their viewpoint and their constructive critisim about it. If you are asking people to give you advice about what type of people you should be around with then your getting more viewpoints on the matter. It could even be a viewpoint that saves you from a deathly mistake like if you were thinking about joining the army and you friend says, ""I dont think your ready for the army maybe somethig that could help but less physical like the airforce"". Then you sign up for the air force and in two weeks you hear on a sad gloomy day that the whole troop you were about to join was sent to the dark jungles of vietnam and now was all killed in action. That tiny viewpoint and good advice just saved your life. "
8840	The next advice on asking for opinions on your advice is critisism. The reason critisism is good is becuase it tells you (in a kind or not so kind) way of what you need to do better at 
8841	Do you have trouble making choices by yourself? Sometimes people aren't sure what to do in certain situations so they ask for advice. 
8842	I believe seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice 
8843	other people may have more experience with the topic, 
8844	you can learn a lot from others, 
8845	getting multiple opinions can help you feel more confident in what you are choosing. 
8846	If you haven't dealt with something much then it will be very useful to get advice and opinions from multiple people who have dealt with your problem before. You should ask numerous people about their past experiences to find out what worked best for them. All of that will help you come to a decision that will hopefully work out. Humans who have more knowledge on your subject will be wiser and can give you a lot of important input to think about when it comes to making a choice. I personally like to talk to my parents about issues because they know much more than I do and usually make the right choices. 
8847	When talking to multiple people they may point out some things you never noticed or thought about, they can also look at your situation from another point of view. This is good because you may be focused on one thing but there could be many other important details that you overlooked. You should always ask more than one person about your problem so that you get a range of opinions and not just one that could be biased. Others may also have more information that you were not aware of. 
8848	If you are making a hard choice, it is important to feel good about what you decide. Knowing that other people agree with you and having a lot of feedback will make you more comfortable with your choice. It can also be less stressful if you know that others believe you are doing the right thing. Many people greatly care about what others think so it can be a relief if they are helped and supported in making a good choice. 
8849	"Seeking opinions can help you make better decisions. ""Two brains are better than one."" See now everyone has heard this quote at least one time in their life. And that's because it's true! "
8850	more minds the better, 
8851	different people from different cultures can have other ideas. 
8852	it's good to have conversations about something that you're not sure on. 
8853	"You know all those tall buildings built in the city? Yeah, those took many minds to make, over 1,000 engineers worked on the worlds tallest building. What if only one engineer made the design plans? I bet you it wouldn't even get past the drawing board. Everyone has heard the ""We're stronger together"" or ""Team work makes the dream work."" Now, do you know everything about airplanes? I bet not, so that's why you would talk to someone that does know something about planes. 99% of engineers need someone else to work for them because they don't know something. See, that's a perfect example of a way that we need other people to help us by using their knowledge that they have and that we don't. But overall everyone is better together and not better divided. "
8854	You may think that one word is good, but then your friend from a different country might think that that word is horrible! See now no one person is the same so that's why sometimes if you have and opinion on something then maybe you should ask someone else that has a different cultural background from you. One thing that famous politicians do is check with other people with different backgrounds to make sure that they don't offend people when they don't want to. Before you go out and start blabbing on about some other country maybe you should try and talk to the people from that country so then you don't offend them? You as a person will never be the same than anyone else. I personally have friends from other countries that eat dogs but look here, in the USA if someone eats a dog, that is very illegal. That's a perfect example of how people with other backgrounds will differ in opinions. So as you've read, most people that are different from you will widely differ in opinions from you. 
8855	Everyone that is successful right now has asked at least one person for help, I can guarantee you that. So if you need help just ask! It's one of the best ways you can get help anyways. There are over 1,000 different information data bases that can help you find information on anything. One that I like is Wikipedia it may not be 100% reliable but that's only if you're ignorant while reading it. Wikipedia has over a million topics of information that you can browse. See this may not seem like your asking for help but it is one way you can. I only listed one good source of information but overall there is hundreds of sources for information and you can get help from any of them. 
8856	So many of us like to ask a variety of people for help when we are faced with a dilemma, and by doing so we give ourselves the best chance of picking the best option for us. 
8857	We gain many advantages by doing this, compared to if we relied only on our own knowledge.  
8858	When we ask a variety of people for their opinion on a matter, we get many different solutions to solve a problem 
8859	As a quarterback for my football team, I am in constant need of improvement on my skills to further our chances of success. I always ask my coach on what he thinks I need to improve on. He always gives me his feedback, and a way he thinks I could improve on that problem. Sometimes his advice doesn't completely fix the issue, so I go to my parents for help. My parents know my strengths and weaknesses, and help my to fix the problem tailoring my coach's advise to me. This gives me an option that not only works, but fits me as a person.  
8860	In a study conducted by Stanford University, scientists found that humans are proven to perform best and make the best decisions when working in a group of people. My mom has always told me that more brains are better than one, and I would have to agree with her. In the past, I have made poor decisions on my own, but when I ask somebody for a second opinion or idea I am able to use what they tell me to improve my own ideas. 
8861	My mother and I have completely different knowledge bases because she is a physical therapist and I am still in middle school. Once, I had a knee that was inflamed and I thought that the problem was I had twisted it, but my mom observed how I was walking and realized that my shoe was causing the problem; my shoe didn't support my arch, so my foot would roll inward, causing my knee to as well. I had no idea that it was my shoe that was causing the issue, but because my mom had different knowledge than I did she was able to figure it out. Problem solving and choice making both involve using past knowledge to do the best thing now. Having a second person with different knowledge than you gives you a second opinion which is extremely useful to make the best choice. 
8862	It is similar to when I went to an art festival in Utah and there was artist who did pavement murals. They looked interesting and beautiful, but to see what the artist wanted you to see you had to stand on footprints that had been painted on the asphalt and look to see what the mural was of. When you have a second person to give you their opinion it is similar to looking at a mural from a different perspective. The first way that you look at the mural is interesting, but it is even better when you change to where the footprints are: the best choice to stand. Having a second opinion can help you choose the right perspective and right choice. 
8863	In times of a tough decision, seeking multiple opinions will help in making a better choice 
8864	Everyones opinion gives a different point of view and can help pick out what decision is best 
8865	As well as, some people have gone through similar things and can help talk out the situation 
8866	When people are getting someone else's a opinion they are making themselves vulnerable to the fact that different possibilities could happen. People can get strongly judged or rejected on their opinions they've made, as that could heavily impact a choice. 
8867	Throughout our life people have been through hardships. Some may be similar situations which include ways it's been dealt with in hopes of others making better choices. With the help of someones past, it can help pave a way for someones decision. Knowing peoples mistakes and consequences can differ what others choose to do. When making a choice some people visit professionals. A few include psychologists, therapists and counselors, they help listen to a problem in hopes of breaking it down and seeking best possible outcomes. These people are there to help drive a path for healthy decision making. Another reason is that knowing other people struggle with things too and that no one is ever alone. It provides at least a little comfort understanding everyone goes through something. Those people who decide to open up about their problems can also help determine a choice. Most people care for the well-being of people in hopes for a successful and enjoyable life 
8868	Talking to people who have dealt with similar problems or people who are professionally trained, can help bring ease to making a decision. 
8869	At one point in life everyone has gone through or knows someone who has been through a tough decision. A couple years ago I had a friend who always gave advice to everyone's problems. She was beautiful, intelligent and fun to be around. However, she did not feel this way about herself. As time went on some situations became too heavy to handle, the stress grew on top of her. At school she only showed perkiness, meanwhile, she was in a darker place. No one was aware of this until a few weeks later when she spoke to her friends, then counselors, next teachers and eventually her parents to get the help she wanted. She was afraid of what the world would think of her if she wasn't perfect. These people all helped her find ways for comfort and how to get the treatment needed without doing something harmful to herself or others. She was steered back into a safe and happy pathway thanks to the help of those around her. 
8870	To finish off, when seeking multiple opinions it can help someone make a better choice. As said in paragraph one, throughout life people have different views on situations and how to resolve them beneficially. As restated in paragraph two, people in life are faced with many challenges. Knowing others struggle can help bring together different ways to handle a decision. Lastly, when my peer was faced with a problem she sought out help, this brought her to a happier place. She is now better than she ever thought she could be. Making a decision shouldn't be done alone, we need to use the people around us to help guide our journey. 
8871	Although some believe that students should only have the option of traditional schooling because they are less likely to learn social skills at home, students should be given the opportunity to participate in online schooling 
8872	it allows them to work at their own pace 
8873	take multiple classes at once. 
8874	To begin with, students will be able to work at their own pace.  
8875	In addition, stress levels in students will significantly decrease. 
8876	Stress and anxiety among students is extremely high.  Many kids have test anxiety and are not able to perform well in testing environments.  Testing anxiety can be caused by numerous factors but one factor that stands out the most is feeling comfortable in an environment.  If the student does not feel comfortable in their classroom while taking a test, they will not produce a good grade.  If the student is placed in a well suited environment, like their home, they are guaranteed to receive a better grade than if they were placed in a classroom.  Secondly, if students are able take their time and not rush through school work, stress levels will reduce and the amount of passing students will increase.  Students often feel rushed to finish in a short amount of time in order to please their teachers.  Although many teachers preach to their students to take their time, teachers unknowingly put a time restriction on student.  Online courses allow kids to start and finish assignment when they feel comfortable doing so.  Online classes lowers the chance of stress among students by eliminating classroom anxiety.  
8877	Furthermore, the ability to take extra classes is given to students. 
8878	In order to graduate at many public and private schools, students must meet graduation requirements.  There are multiple classes a student must take to graduate that are electives.  These classes take up space in kid's schedules restricting the amount of core classes a student can take.  If schools allow these kids to take these classes in their free time, students will be able to complete these courses and move onto classes they will use in the future.  For example, all school require students to partake in a health class throughout their high school careers.  If students are capable of taking this class in the summer rather than in the school year, a new gap in their schedule opens for another class.  Also, online schools prevent advance students from burning out.  Many children who were placed in advanced learning at a young age experience a burn out.  This occurs when the student does not have to work as hard in their education as others.  This produces a poor work ethic, which is essential in the real world.  By allowing these students to take an extra course online, they will be challenged forcing them to improve their work ethic and time management.  Online school gives students a chance to get ahead in their education  
8879	In conclusion, students should be given the opportunity to participate in online school because they will have the ability to work at a their own speed, reduce their stress levels, and participate in more classes.  If students are unable to take online courses, they are more likely to get off track in their learning.  By giving students this education outlet, students will be more likely to graduate and be ready to dive into their adult lives. 
8880	Every child leads a different life and is born into a different environment  - but the one thing that every child deserves is the chance to receive a quality education. People across the globe have fought for this vital opportunity for decades, advocating for those whose path to knowledge is obscured by circumstance 
8881	Students who have obstacles such as mental health issues or the lack of local education would greatly benefit and be better accommodated from the opportunity to take classes online and from their home. 
8882	Many children struggle with slight disabilities such as dyslexia or ADHD - small occurrences that hinder the learning process. However, these minuscule variations can have major effects on the way a student absorbs information and needs to be accommodated in the classroom, a setback that many public schools aren't equipped to handle. This can prove detrimental to the development of the student - without the proper instruction formatted for the style in which they learn, their true academic potential can remain untapped. With classes taken inside the home, this can change. In the environment they know best, surrounded by people that understand how they need to be aided, the child can thrive without the pressure to adapt to the method of learning endorsed inside the mainstream school. They can explore options in their education and take the time they need to properly understand new concepts, all within their home and without the restraint of a larger public entity telling them to conform. 
8883	While a rarity, there are some areas of the globe where young people are denied the chance to receive an education. This is nearly never the fault of the student - where they live, the government of the country that they live in, and their gender or physical appearance are all traits that they cannot control. When the terrorist group Al-Qaeda was present in Pakistan, many Pakistani girls couldn't go to school or leave their houses due to the militia's belief that women were not deserving of rights or an education. While these girls were being denied the opportunity to be educated, this doesn't mean that they weren't deserving - online classes could've and still could improve that situation. Through the availability of methods to access classwork in the home, children that have been circumstantially denied the chance to attend school could be granted that chance again, and with potentially less risk. Classes taken within the home would allow students in difficult life situations to gain back their opportunity to learn, and continue furthering their intellectual development despite their circumstances. 
8884	Anxiety can infiltrate every corner of a student's thought process, and whether the stress is academically related or not, it affects the way that a child learns and grows. Participation grades, group projects, popularity expectations, and the rumor mill of regular public school can take a more severe toll on children with anxiety disorders, making it hard for these students to see school as a place to gain knowledge. Instead, they begin to dread it, sick and tired of the constant pressure and nervousness they experience in the classroom. However, when attending classes within the home, these judgments can be alleviated. The anxiety within the student is eased by being in a familiar environment, a place where they can decide what interactions to engage in and when. An opportunity like at-home classes can transform an anxious child's perspective of education from a negative and stressful experience into something positive and beneficial, helping them progress academically while accommodating to their mental health. 
8885	The opportunity to receive at-home education and attend classes through an online program would provide important accommodations to students that otherwise feel out-of-place in the regular public school system, namely those with mental setbacks or difficult geographical circumstances. While it is a privilege and would most likely take time to implement, the chance for a personalized education is a chance that all children deserve.  
8886	Taking one's own advice may be beneficial when common sense is involved, but seeking multiple opinions helps one make a better choice. 
8887	People depend on other's gratification and it feels great when someone likes the outcome of a decision. In order for this to happen, one should ask multiple people for advice and shouldn't only take their's. When I take my own advice, it is often biased towards what I want, and I don't necessarily see all points of view of the decision I have to make. Taking my own advice is beneficial in situations where common sense is used and in situations where I have no one to to ask, such as logical situations or doing school work.  
8888	With more important decisions that go beyond common sense, seeking multiple opinions avoids bias, leads to multiple perspectives, and opens up new possibilities. 
8889	When someone seeks advice, they should ask multiple people because it ensures them that their choice will be least biased. People should avoid bias because some opinions may not benefit them and may only benefit the person who is giving the piece of advice. When people ask for advice, each person they ask most likely has a different opinion. When all these opinions are considered, the chance of bias is reduced. When someone takes their own advice, they may have a slight inclination to go for what they want to do, and they may not consider all options. For example, I have a decision to make of whether or not I want to move for my father's work to Generic_City. I only considered my own preferences for a while, and I automatically said that I didn't want to go. I refused to leave my friends, my school, my routine, and everything else that makes my life splendid here. When I finally decided to hear what my parents had to say, my choice became less biased. My parents helped me see the benefits of moving, which I had not thought about because I didn't want to think that I would enjoy moving. In addition they helped me see it in their point of view, which leads to the next point. 
8890	Talking to more than one person when faced with a difficult situation leads to multiple perspectives. 
8891	With each person one asks for advice, there is ridiculously small chance that they would all have the same exact opinion. Each person is different and has a new perspective of the dilemma. Seeking advice from my parents would yield different perspectives than if I ask my friends or siblings. For instance, when I talked to my friends about the possibility of me moving to Generic_City, they were disappointed, as expected. They didn't want me to move, and they didn't want me to leave them. When my parents talked to me about moving to Generic_City, I was able to see it in their perspective. To them it would be a fabulous opportunity to study abroad, meet new people, learn a new culture, and visit a wonderful country. This new perspective opened me up to the idea of living in a completely different country. 
8892	seeking multiple opinions may open up new possibilities that should be considered when making a decision 
8893	. Each person one talks to may offer a different alternative to the decision at hand. This leads to an array of new and sometimes worse options. When talking to my parents about moving to Generic_City, they told me that moving to Generic_City now would be the most beneficial because if we didn't move before high school, we would probably have to leave in the middle of the school year later on. In addition, some friends helped me see that moving to Generic_City would open an entirely new set of doors. My brother fantasized about the enjoyable vacations we could have and meeting new people at a new school. The more people one talks to, the more opinions they get, and the more opinions they get, the more options they hav to make the best choice. 
8894	Crucial aspects of making a good choice are avoiding bias, seeing the decision through other people's perspective, and considering all options. Seeking advice from multiple people leads to all of this, making asking people for advice an important task to do when faced with a choice to make. Avoiding bias aids in making a decision to which the outcome is beneficial to all concerned. New perspectives helps to consider how everyone feels about a choice. Finally, considering all options and outcomes makes for an easier time deciding which choice is better overall. Even when making petty choices that most people make each day, such as choosing what to eat and what to wear, people may benefit from a bit of advice. The world would be a wonderful place if everyone asks someone for advice before doing something that could change the course of events. Choices wouldn't be irrational, and petty fights wouldn't break out and start arguments or wars. All it takes to make a good decision and to be satisfied by the outcome is to talk to people and ask for their opinion. What is so difficult about this? 
8895	My phone buzzed with his name appearing at the top. God, I don't wanna talk to you right now, take a hint man. My boyfriend and I had just had a huge fight and I'm texting my friend Generic_Name for advice. After explaining her opinion she says to listen to other peoples advice then decide what to do.  When faced with an issue normally our first reaction is to try to solve it on our own, although most of the time our head is way up in the clouds and we need another person to drag us back to the reality of the issue. Although most times, you need a few more than just that one person to help you make the correct choice. 
8896	getting advice could be a good thing, since many different people have all had vastly different experiences. 
8897	"At the Virginia school of Technology they completed a study on getting advice from just one person compared to reciving advice more more than one person. Both people were given the same issue but only one was able to receive more than one persons advice. One of the conductors of the experiment, Dr. Joy Engstrom, stated that, "" The person who received more than one piece of advice seems to have made the more logical choice than the person with only one piece of advice, fixing the situation faster and healthier."" Therefore, asking more than just one person for advice can help you pull out a stronger and better outcome of the situation. Plus, receiving more advice can also hep you make a more logical choice then acting on what just one other person thinks is best. The advice given also probably would apply to other situations as well, so you are learning and growing as a person. "
8898	receiving advice from more than one person can also help to build trust with the people you ask. 
8899	"A study done by Jake Miller at the Maryland University of Health shows that when someone comes to another person for advice their trust in them normally increases. Mr. Miller Claims that, "" You install a certain level of trust in someone when you ask them for advice, if it be something small or something huge. Asking for their opinion on a situation also boosts the overall relationship."" More over, their advice doesn't only just help the situation it helps strengthen your relationship with those people. Plus, most of the time people are more open to helping you when you have a sturdy relationship with them. Not only does asking for advice show that you trust the people your asking but it can even help strengthen a whole groups relation and trust. "
8900	different sets of advice can also bring you to the best possibly out come. Creating a more logical and better choice to make. 
8901	At the University of Utah a survey went around asking students if they made better choice when they asked more people for advice or if they made a better choice when they asked one person for advice 70.2% said they made a better choice when asking more people compared to the 29.8% that claimed they made a better choice when asking one person. However, majority claimed the best outcome would be asking just more than one person, still a lot of students replied just one person. From past experiences asking one person can make you think that that option and only that option will be the best, when in reality its actually not. When asking for advice you need someone who gives their opinion on what hey would do, not try to snatch away your judgment and brainwash you to their opinion. 
8902	asking more people for their opinion can not only help you build trust with the people you ask, but help you learn more about them and their experiences and make the best choice. So in the future it is much recommended that you seek more than just one persons opinion on a situation your not so sure about.  
8903	"One morning, Generic_Name the Pterodactyl hopped outside of his old nest. The nest has been in his family for generations but had started to wear down. The twigs were falling out left and right and they would poke him while he slept. Not to mention that it was located in a dangerous neighborhood. Generic_Name decided it was time to sell the old nest and move into a new one. He asked his pterodactyl friends where to move in. Generic_Name the Pterodactyl said, ""you should move in with me and we could be roommates!"" Generic_Name thought about it, but politely declined his friend's offer for Generic_Name was a messy house keeper and only played video games. He then asked Generic_Name the Pterodactyl who answered with, ""I know a great realtor by the name of Generic_Name the Velociraptor."" Later that day Generic_Name looked up Generic_Name on Boggle, the search engine for dinosaurs, and found that Generic_Name was a pretty sketchy realtor. Finally he asked his good friend Generic_Name the Pterodactyl for advice. Generic_Name was not only a good house keeper, but also knew the Jurassic Area pretty well. He told Generic_Name, ""Make sure to look for nests that are in good neighborhoods and are in good condition."" Generic_Name was a great help, and after many hours of research, Generic_Name was finally able to call another nest home.  Some people often ask for advice from multiple people (or pterodactyls in Generic_Name's case). "
8904	Seeking multiple opinions on something can help 
8905	give you clearer and better feedback, 
8906	can even help you decide for yourself. 
8907	The more trials you have in an experiment, the more accurate your results will be. Let's use Generic_Name for an example. If Generic_Name had only listened to Generic_Name, then he would be up to his ankles in empty potato chip bags and energy drinks. It was because he asked multiple pterodactyls, that he was able to get the right advice. This doesn't mean that Generic_Name was planning on being messy or that Generic_Name was trying to scam Generic_Name. They were just trying to be good friends. From a scientific perspective, when planning a science experiment, you would want to have at least three trials. This is because something out of the ordinary could happen in your first trial and that it usually takes at least three trials to recognize a pattern in the experiment.  If you are asking for advice - don't pick your favorite person. When I say this I mean people like your parents, your boss, etc. Although they could have good opinions, you might listen to them more than the other people who are trying to give you real feedback. Not only that but you don't want to have a person to lie to you and say that there was nothing wrong with your outfit or that your story didn't have confusing plot lines, when they both do. But on the other side of the feedback spectrum, don't pick someone who is going to crush your spirits. I once had a teacher in 6th grade that inspired me to learn more about the world's history and pushed me to learn. I even considered being a historian when I was older. Then, in 7th grade, I got a 72 year-old teacher who instead of having us learn about the Spanish-American War - stopped the whole class to look at pictures of his grandson. Don't get me wrong, I love looking at adorable picture of babies. But during the year, I lost my love for history and never thought about being a historian since. So what I'm trying to say is that you should pick someone you trust and that you respect and know that they will do the same for you. 
8908	Facts101. com says that your gut is right 85% of the time. I've been in the scenario multiple times where I circled an answer on a quiz, but convinced myself that I was wrong and circle another answer. So I turned in my paper when I was done and my teacher graded them. She gave them back and it turned out that I was right the first time! Whenever I need help deciding something I try flipping a coin in the air. Before it lands, I most likely all ready know what I want because I'm hopping for it to land on heads so I can go out with my friends instead of getting a early start on my chemistry project. If you ever need help deciding something try using this trick. 
8909	Have you ever needed advise but didn't know who to ask? You think about who to ask do you ask your uncle is it your grandpa teacher who? The answer is all of them 
8910	it is much better to ask multiple peoples opinions than just one for multiple reasons. 
8911	By asking more people you will have a solution that works best for you. Remember that you don't have to take any one persons advise you can use the the advise given to you to form your own solution. Over all you get a more personalized response to your problems or question.  
8912	not every one has the experience and knowledge on your situation. 
8913	Not everyone knows how to do it or what to do. If you ask your dad and he knows nothing about it you cant just give up. you have to ask multiple people someone will give an answer. However you cant stop there you need something that works for you and some body who might have more experience in that area of life and give something that works better for you. 
8914	if you have a question and you ask more than person you are going to get a more valid response. 
8915	I mean if the majority of people give one response it probably the correct answer. You dont to ask one person only to find out that they're wrong. I would also advise you to ask the person why they think what they think. asking more than one person will help you better stand the problem and by doing that we can narrow it down to give the most valid response. 
8916	When you ask someone for advice on something do you try to get a second opinion? Well if you have not I bet not getting multiple opinions is not the best choice to make because its smarter to get multiple. Say even if the other opinions are not something you would want or do it is still smart to get because they could help but they wouldn't effect you if they do not help. 
8917	 so why not get the second or maybe third opinion on something it will only help. 
8918	you are getting multiple different people who have different experiences and opinions so you have many to choose from 
8919	If you just get one opinion on something then you are only have one thing to go off of but if you have multiple than you can choose which one you think is best. This means a lot because the first opinion might not always be the best one for you. So go and get that second,third or maybe fourth opinion it won't hurt it will only help and you have many different people with different experiences in there life to help you. For example you could ask someone who dose not have much experience in what your asking but then if you get a second opinion they could help you because maybe they have had experience with it sometime in there life. So if you would have just got the one opinion it might not have turned out good as it would if you got that second opinion. So just getting one opinion may not be the best choice. 
8920	Well not everyone you ask could have the right information, some could be telling false or just bad information. So getting other opinions could come in big for you if the first opinion was not very good. For example if you are trying to get a opinion on what you should buy a family member for a gift and you only get one opinion and they say that the person likes something but they really don't then that could be pretty bad for you. I don't think you would be to pleased either if that happened so just get a second opinion so everyone can be happy. Also sometimes the opinion could just be really bad and not help you at all. So do your self a favor and get multiple opinions.  
8921	if you play a sport then getting a second opinion is huge especially if it deals with an injury 
8922	When athletes get injured they get an opinion from the doctor if they think they should get surgery or whatever and most of them go to other doctors for more opinions to find there best option. This helps them a lot because some doctors could say they need surgery but then others they go to could say that they won't need surgery and that they just need rest or physical therapy or something. sometimes the doctors will even say they might need career ending surgery but another doctor says that he can still play after a surgery he just need to recover. As you can expect that other opinion helps big time for them so they won't have to possibly end there career. Or it could be the other way around that one doctor says he dose not need surgery but other doctors do then he should go with surgery so whatever is hurting does not get worse and force him to stop playing. For example a couple of weeks ago there was this pitcher in baseball that got injured and was going to doctors to see if he was okay one doctor said he would need Tommy John surgery which usually puts you out for a whole season and he didn't want that so he went to two other doctors who both said he wouldn't need it so that saved him from missing a entire season which helps him a lot. 
8923	Now  I will conclude my reasons on why people should seek multiple opinions to help them later on. So as you can tell after reading this finding more opinions is very helpful and could change your life in some ways. However this does not mean that every first opinion you get is wrong it just means that it dose not hurt to have multiple opinions to choose from. Like I said in sports and In basically anything in life it helps because you will always have choices to make and getting more opinions might just come up big for you. After going over my essay of why you should get multiple opinions then I hope you consider seeking more than one opinion next time you need an opinion on something.     
8924	being to be able to listen to all perspectives, 
8925	getting an all around better answer, 
8926	being able to understand the concept more clearly. 
8927	It would cause you hear out all sorts of opinions to see the view of all the people you asked. Gaining all of the knowledge will cause a bigger solution that would most likely end out in the way you'd like it to be. If you were to only listen to a single answer, you would only get that one and only opinion that could not work as well as you thought it would. Gaining knowledge of other's opinions are important, they're everywhere, in presidential election, government decisions, FCPS decisions, etc. 
8928	The reason for that is because you're looking at a wide variety of answers rather than from one person. You'd get a broader knowledge of the subject, and you probably don't have to ask again. The information is likely more accurate since it came from multiple people. One single person could accidentally give you the wrong information causing a possible bad outcome. For example, there are many wars caused accidentally just because one person made a minor communication error. 
8929	All the information that you've gathered from multiple perspective will all combine into a more suitable solution. That one solution will become bigger and bolder than the separate answers. It's like engineering, they discuss about each of their ideas, plan it all into one, then creating their first prototype. 
8930	During the summer of 2018, I was torn between two decisions. I had the choice to go to a famous baseball tournament in Cooperstown, New York, or go to Europe with my family. I was thinking about this tournament since the day I started playing baseball, but going to Europe is also very fun and I get to spend time with my family. when I was trying to decide between the two destinations, I consulted some of my friends and adults that I know. My parents wanted me to come with them to europe, and my coaches wanted me to go with them to Cooperstown. My teameates wanted me to go to Cooperstown, but my siblings wanted me to go to Europe. they all gave me some advice on where I should go, and my coach said, go where you would feel the most comfortable, and where you will have the most fun. Hearing all of these opinions and getting advice from everyone allowed me to make the best decision, I ended up going to Europe with my family.  As you get more information, you might run across a new option that you didn't know was available. 
8931	Getting advice from several opinions can often open up new options 
8932	Before my 11th birthday, my dad gave me the choice to get a new Xbox, or a new beseball bat. He gave me the day to devide which one he should get for me. When I went outside to play with my friends, I decided to ask for their advice. Some of my friends that play Xbox told me to get a new Xbox so that I could play with them. My baseball teammates told me to get a new bat so I could share it with them. One of my friends that I asked, played neither Xbox, or on my baseball team. He told me to take the cash value of the more expensive item, and spend it how I want. I was so thankful I had asked for his advice, because I never would have thought of this in a million years. Along with opening new options, seeking advice from more people might open you up to new perspectives. 
8933	Asking for advice from different people can help give more perspectives on the situation 
8934	During the summer of 2017, I had a big growth spurt, leaving me with a bunch of clothes and gear that does not fit me anymore. I was going to sell my stuff for profit, so I started to plan a garage sale and sorting out how much I would sell everything for. When I was asking for advice on how I should sell my stuff, most of my friends told me to sell the so that I could make as much money as possible. when I asked my teacher for advice on how I should sell them, she told me that I should not sell them at all. she told me that I should donate it to a charity that she works for in her free time. she told me about the organization and how it gives back to kids that are less fortunate and can't afford clothes like us.  This helped me get a new perspective on the situation that I didn't know existed. 
8935	Asking for advice from different people will be more beneficial than asking for advice from just one person.  If you're asking for advice, ask for several opinions, it is more beneficial and will get you the best answer. 
8936	Distance learning is a new tool that some schools are using in order to give students an option of taking a class at home instead of at the classroom. This is an interesting way of teaching because it provides the comfort of working at home for students, which is becoming an increasing trend as of 2019, while still providing high-quality education from professional educators. 
8937	Nevertheless, while distance teaching is an innovative idea in theory, this method will have a negative impact on students 
8938	there will be too many distractions that will keep students from growing through educational means 
8939	developing life skills. 
8940	One of the reasons why video based learning will negatively influence students is that this option promotes weakens one's work ethic. 
8941	"One's house will most often contain most of their sources of entertainment, such as video games, food, hobbies, electronic devices, and more. As children with developing brains, staying on task with all of these factors can only be accomplished by a few, but not the majority. A study conducted by the University of Virginia states that, ""almost 90% of students under the age of 18 have an attention span of about 10-30 minutes before becoming distracted"" (Generic_Name). This exemplifies how most students cannot stay focused in a video based classroom when there is no adult supervisor or teacher directly making sure they listen, which is quite difficult to achieve via distance learning. With this in mind, it is harder for students to have motivation to complete work during class time when they have easy access to other sources of entertainment right at their fingertips. Thus, video based learning is detrimental to student's work ethic because it gives them no motivation to complete their work whereas in the normal school system, they would be forced to work on it during class because of a direct presence of an adult supervisor keeping them on track. All in all, a world without video learning for all students is a one that strengthen's one's work ethic through practice in the work place rather than at home. "
8942	Secondly, distance learning encourages antisocial behavior among students, especially in the elementary and middle school level where their brains are developing social skills. 
8943	"According to the New York Times, ""children at the earliest age of 6 years old begin developing social patterns that they will continue to emulate throughout their entire lives"" (Generic_Name). This proves how these years in a classroom are a crucial time for developing young minds to nurture and grow into mature adults. The reason why video based learning will tamper with this stage in student's minds is because if they only work at home, then unless they go to after school activities, they will not experience how to physically develop long lasting relationships with other people in a work setting. When a teacher assigns a group project, students not only learn about a the topic of their assignment but how to work with and interact with other humans beings of a similar intellect. "
8944	This is an important skill to develop because it reflects how people in the real world work in corporate settings to solve a problem together. If one cannot work with other people with differing perspectives in a constructive manner then they will struggle their entire lives. Thus, distance learning also negatively impacts students by denying them the chance to develop social skills that will be vital to them when they become independent adults. 
8945	Lastly, video based learning should not be mandatory for all students because it is more difficult for teachers to give individual assistance to students who are struggling in the class. 
8946	"Most often then not, there has been a time where everyone has not understood a concept in a class, or has had a question about an assignment. Video based learning does not help these people since it is more of a hassle for teachers to continue on with a lesson and answer a hundred different questions simultaneously.  Recently, a poll taken in 2019 with the schools who attempted to use distance learning reported that, ""almost 95% of students had their grades drop between half and a full letter grade in the past semester because it was more difficult for them to ask questions and succeed"" (Generic_Name). This statistic shows from a student's perspective how this educational system is not even increasing the rate of obtaining high grades, which is what this option was meant to do. The interactions between a teacher and a student in a physical setting is what makes the standard class a successful system since it ensures that teachers have an equal opportunity to make the lesson as clear as possible. Video based learning completely takes that function of a classroom away, which hurts students by making it harder to do well in school. Thus, distance learning should not be implemented in schools all around the world since it will only work against students goals. "
8947	In conclusion, distance learning is a system with good intentions, but has its flaws that makes it far inferior to the standard classroom. This is because it limits the ability to have a strong work ethic, to develop social skills, and to have the option to ask as many questions as students need. All in all, this educational system will result in an ill equipped generation that is not ready for adulthood and the workplace, and should not be used in schools in the coming future.  
8948	Have you ever had to make an important life decision? It can be very difficult, depending on the impact of your decision, to choose right away. As a result, you might ask your peers to give you advice to make the right choice. You may find that you agree with some people and disagree with others. Other times you might have to meet in the middle and find pros and cons about everyone's opinion and then make a decision with that information. 
8949	you can gain multiple points of view, 
8950	you might find it easier to make your decision with other opinions, 
8951	you might find a better option through multiple opinions rather than just one. 
8952	Everyone has a different way of thinking. Your best friends way of thinking is very different than yours. Sometimes you might have the smarter idea, sometimes they will have the smarter idea. I know if I had to make a big, life-changing decision that I would ask all of my closest friends. I can recall one time when I was making a personal decision about a year ago, and I did not know what to do. I asked my closest friends what I should do, and almost all of them responded just about how I expected them to. Most of them said they wanted to see me happy, so they encouraged me to choose the decision that would make me the happiest. Others gave me facts, pros and cons, and why they would be disappointed if I made one decision over the other. They then told me that they believed in me, and I would eventually make the right decision. Having those multiple points of view on what they thought really helped me decide on what I should do. I think if I had not have asked them for advice, I would have made a decision I would have regretted. 
8953	"Sometimes when a decision is very impactful, you can get stressed out over the choice you want to make. Asking others may make deciding easier because all you have to honestly do is listen to their ideas and decide if you agree with them or not. Then, using your common sense and their advice, you can choose the decision you believe is best for you . Also, you actually might know what you are going to choose. But you might still want to ask other people what they think because that can ""confirm"" that you have made the right decision. "
8954	Let's say you have weighed your options of certain decisions that you think are the right decisions. You chose what you think, in your mind, is best. You then ask your friends for their opinion, and suddenly everyone is saying everything different than what you thought. All of your wonderful thoughts are suddenly crushed with a wrecking ball. After listening to all of their thoughts, you find some are much more brilliant than yours. You then go back and completely rethink your decisions, just because of those few opinions. After extensive thought, you decide that your original idea was bogus. When you first make a decision, even if you had thought about for a long time, the stress of making a decision quick can sometimes fog your thinking. That is why having other people's opinions can help you make the right decision, even if it is the second time trying to choose what is best for you. 
8955	having people help you is very, very important. I believe if I did not have people help me, not even just give me advice, that I would not do my best in school. We as humans need other humans! It's just how it goes. Asking for advice is a pretty normal thing to do. When asking for advice, remember it can only positively effect you by giving you different points of view, help you make a better decision, and you possibly can find a better choice than you originally thought.  
8956	Making decisions can be difficult when people don't have the confidence that their thinking is the best choice. This is why, when making important decisions, one tends to seek multiple opinions from others. 
8957	one can look in a different perspective 
8958	can consider the best options.  
8959	Specifically, this is because having a new perspective can provoke more options for people to choose from. Seeking more advice from people with different thoughts can lead to more choices that one can consider. This is helpful because there is a bigger chance to have ideas that would make better decisions than the other. Also, one can consider things in a new way that they haven't thought about. If people are stuck with the one point of perspective that they have, this would not lead to another way of thinking. However, listening to other people for advice may help people to consider things in a way that they have not yet thought about. Therefore, the new way of thinking can turn things around into an opposite route of the original. Another example is that someone can propose an option that is better than you. Never think that you have the best idea, because there is always another creative mind that can think in a different perspective. One should get advice from these type of people, but continue to seek other opinions that may be better than the last. It is always useful to ask multiple people for advice because everyone has a different perspective that they look through. 
8960	First, it is important to ask people for advice because one can get multiple useful suggestions. If you have a handful of ideas in your mind, then you can ask people for the best options and why they think that. This would help people to carefully consider the options with actual reasons that support their answer. Additionally, one can make improvements to their thoughts. By getting advice from people, one can figure out what they are lacking. By knowing what has to be revised, they can make improvements to their thinking. One would also be able to gain knowledge from people. It is possible that others know more information about the topic that is being considered. From gaining new information, this could also help figure out the options that would be better overall, when considering the new knowledge into the decision. When trying to find out the best option that is on the plate, it is helpful to ask others about their opinion. 
8961	Have you ever asked someone for advice? If yes, then you know it can be a good thing. Asking for advice means to get other people's take on different options and seeing others choices. For example, teenagers ask for advice on their Instagram photos and their outfits all of the time. It helps them decide what they want to post or wear. Also, just know that there are no strict rules on how or what to ask advice for either, it is a very casual thing 
8962	by having multiple options 
8963	seeing different point of views, 
8964	increase the chance of having a happier life. 
8965	Having different points of views means to see how other people react and respond. When you get a new point of view you can make a pro and con check list. A pro and con check list is when you list all of the good things and list all of the bad things for that one opinion. These check list are very versatile, and can be used in many different ways. One example is, picking a restaurant to eat at, for the pros you could say, the food tastes good, but the waits are long and the service is not that great. So now you decide you do not want to eat there and you go to an even better restaurant. Another example is, for spring break you want to go on vacation, but you also want to stay home and rest. When you make a list you can decide witch one you want to do most or the one with the most pros listed. Asking others for their opinions can persuade your choices and also give you ideas. Overall, having other peoples opinions can better your life as well as theirs 
8966	Having a good life should be enjoying what you do and be excited about where you are and how you live your life. Having others options can benefit your life by asking where to visit in the world or where to travel to. Other opinions will also, help you realize your consequences. You may not know you are making a bad choice, but by getting others intake you will realize if you are making a good or bad choice. A parent or guardian is always a person to go to if you are not sure if you are making a bad choice or not. A teacher or school counselor can help with problems too. All of these people can give you advice that will most likely help you. 
8967	"Schooling has been around for thousands of years, and, as the rest of society has evolved, the traditional schooling technique has virtually stayed the same. Children still remain at desks, listening to their teachers lecture; kids still take home worksheets for extra practice called ""homework."" Standardized tests are still given, and kids are still excelling. However, as time goes on, more people have begun to question this type of schooling, and why it has not changed for over 1000 years. A recent change people have suggested, with the rise of technology, is ""distance learning"", a way to ""attend"" school from the confines of ones own home. "
8968	While this idea seems promising, it is not a good change for the schooling system because, 
8969	for the vast majority of students, it will cause unneeded distractions, 
8970	a less stimulating environment, 
8971	and the inability to distinguish home and work life. 
8972	As children grow and learn, they are more likely to choose play over work. Because of this, kids are often distracted from their assignments in school, 
8973	whether it be with the thoughts of their Buzz Lightyear action figure they can not wait to play with or with the drama on their cell phone. When children are placed in the sterile environment of the school system, these distractions are minimized because the child's surroundings are sterile, solely containing learning materials and peers who are trying to accomplish the same task. If a child were to attempt to learn at home, no matter what age they were, they would be surrounded with the temptations of play, and, even if they had the power to restrain, it would affect their ability to concentrate and retain information. 
8974	Continuing, the home simply does not stimulate the mind as completely as the school does. 
8975	In a school there are hundreds of resources at a child's fingertips: libraries full of books, teachers full of knowledge, materials full of the ability to educate. While the home may have educational resources, the vast amount does not compare to that of a traditional school. 
8976	Not only does a classroom have abundant learning materials and information, but it also has students who help each other grow and prosper in their learning environment. For hundreds of years, the traditional desk-and-chalkboard schooling system has been used, and over those years, people are still excelling and test scores are still rising. This is because the school stimulates the mind like nothing else; it allows children a place to let their curiosity wander and lead their education. To take away the school will take away the stimulation. 
8977	Finally, a common problem found in adults is an inability to separate home and work life; this begins at a young age when children fail to make the clear distinction between home and school. 
8978	By allowing students to participate in school from their home, it will make this distinction even less clear which will not only affect the child's present life but also his or her future life as a working adult. when there is no specific time and place for a child to learn, their home and education lives blend together, often affecting both for the worse. An example of this is seen in Tara Westover, the famous author of the memoir,  Educated.  Westover was home schooled but was often given little time to learn because of her home obligations. This caused her to lack education as well as the knowledge that home and school are two distinctly different things. If students were able to mix their home and school lives, the negative results of an inability to distinguish The Home and The School would far outweigh the positives. 
8979	Many may disagree with this position, saying that this opportunity, to learn in the comfort of ones own home, would greatly benefit those who suffer from illness or other challenges that prevent them from attending school. 
8980	"However, the ratio of those who are unable to attend a traditional school to those who are is very small. Many students would take advantage of this ""distance learning"" opportunity and use it for an easier education rather than a better one. There are several types of accommodations one can receive for illness or any other obstacle that hinders their education; allowing any person, without such disabilities, to receive these accommodations endangers them and their education. "
8981	Although the idea of learning from home has been widely acknowledged, it has also been widely debated. There are several positives when one looks on the surface of this idea, however when one truly delves into the logistics of such a change, they will realize that there are too many negatives that accompany it. The home is too distracting and does not allow the proper stimulation for learning that a child needs to succeed in life; the lack of a distinguishable home and school life will also harm the child as he or she matures. If a change that is supposed to bring better and more accessible schooling to children in fact causes the opposite, this change will not benefit the education system.  
8982	As the modern world advances in technology and media, schools need to advance with it. An outdated education system leaves little room for student growth and success; it can damper the effects of the hard work that both teachers and students put into school. However, this waste of efforts can be easily avoided by means of the updating of school policies. For example, it is growing increasingly more common for schools to offer distance learning as an option for their students. Distance learning allows students to engage in online classes and video conferencing as a way of learning from home. Therefore, students would be able to attend classes virtually from their own homes. 
8983	Distance learning is an absolutely essential program that all schools should offer, 
8984	it allows long-term home bound students to attend classes, 
8985	short-term absent students to make up their school work faster, 
8986	increases the student-technology relationship, which strengthens learning as a whole. 
8987	Distance learning would allow long-term home bound students to learn alongside their peers, even if they are unable to physically attend school. 
8988	Every year, thousands of students are forced to stay home for extended periods of time due to physical or mental illness or other individual reasons. These students, while they are oftentimes provided worksheets and assignments, are quite prone to falling behind in terms of the material. If they are not at school and at the lessons each and every day, it is extremely easy to lose awareness of the material being taught, especially if the only outlet for their learning is a packet of worksheets with practice problems. Without a teacher and peers, these students do not have access to immediate feedback on mistakes or teachers who are able to answer their questions. However, with distance learning, long-term home bound students would be able to work alongside their peers. They could engage in online activities and applications that would strengthen their knowledge of the material, while also allowing them to interact with their teacher and peers. Especially when it comes to video conferencing, students who cannot physically attend school would still be able to ask their teacher questions in person and potentially have private lessons. It is never a student's fault if they are unable to come to school due to an illness; therefore, it should not be difficult to learn if that is the case. 
8989	Not only would distance learning aid long-term home bound students, but it would also help the short-term ones. 
8990	Students stay home from school every day, whether it be from a minor illness or injury or a trip out of town. Obviously, these students are at much less risk of losing their understanding of the material, but absences still require make-up work. Students can miss lessons and lectures, project presentations, and critical study time with their peers that would better their understanding. With distance learning, a student who is well enough to work but contagious to their peers could still present a project, take a test, take notes on a lecture, and engage in class discussions all from home. It is unfair to limit a student's potential learning time based on things that they cannot control, like illnesses or travel. Furthermore, students that travel frequently would also be benefited, as they could work while on the go and review material when they have free time so as not to fall so far behind their classmates. 
8991	Some might argue that the use of technology and distance learning would not be an effective way to educate students. There are possibilities for misuse of technology and applications and many people fear that an introduction of too much technology into education would lessen the quality of that education exponentially. 
8992	However, there are steps that can be taken to limit off-task student activity: students could be limited to certain applications or browser extensions or be monitored by a parent or guardian 
8993	All things considered, though, the potential for the waste of students' time in no way warrants a dismissal of distance learning. Especially when considering all of the students that would otherwise not be able to learn, the meager amount of work to set up technology restrictions for those schools who desire it is most definitely worth it in the long run. Furthermore, simply because some students may abuse the power of distance learning does not mean that it should not be offered to those who truly need it. 
8994	Distance learning should be made available to all applicable students because it allows for long-term home bound students to attend classes, short-term absent students to make up their school work faster, and increases the student-technology relationship. Distance learning programs would not only help the students in keeping up with their studies, but also teachers in supplying their students with adequate learning resources for all situations. It has become even more prevalent now; as the COVID-19 virus spreads internationally, more and more schools and universities are transitioning to virtual learning for the safety of students, teachers, and staff. Truly, distance learning ensures the safety of those involved without sacrificing any of the benefits of a physical classroom. So long as advancements like distance learning continue to be made in the future, education will maintain its vital and prevalent role in all students' lives. 
8995	Therefor, students would benefit from distance learning 
8996	it will help those in need of a flexed schedule, 
8997	those with social anxiety, 
8998	for those with parents who simple believe in home schooling. 
8999	There are some people that can't be in a crowed of people because it causes them to get anxious. 
9000	There are also people with other types of disorders that may lead them to need to be in the hospitals or just unable to function well with other people. People who are in situations like this can benefit from being able to take online classes because it can take away the discomfort of being around a large group of people. I have a friend who has social anxiety, and it cause her to have panic attacks when she even sees a lot of people all at once. It would be a lot easier for her to be able to work from home so she will be able to be focused on her work, and not scared of being in a group. 
9001	Additionally, Not only can this make students lives easier but parents as well. There are parents out there that prefer their children be home schooled because they don't like how the school systems are run. 
9002	But those parents may not have the time to be their children teacher. In a situation like this having distant learning can give that child a way to learn at home with out their parent having to stop working to become their teacher. This also makes the parent feel safe knowing their child is at home and away from a the safety concerns that come from being in a school. Along with the annoying phone calls and emails about their children's behavior or any other concerns the school usually will try contact get in contact about. My mother for one, is hates getting those calls throughout the day or emails flooding her inbox. This is a solution that can better everyone involved. 
9003	Finally, having the ability to take classes online will give students the opportunity to still take care of their other daily obligations. 
9004	Many student have to work so they can provide for their families. Others have to take care of their siblings. My cousin is one for example, My aunt passed away on my cousins 18th birthday while she was a senior. With no other family living close to her she was forced to be the guardian of her younger sibling. Having to work and take care of other people can be a full time job on its on, but still needing to finish school in the process makes it just that much more complicated. Having the chance to take classes online would make anyone in situations similar to those life much easier. This showing the benefits this distant leaning can have for certain students. 
9005	Imagine you are applying for your dream job. You are preparing for your interview, but you are not sure how to answer a potential question. Only asking your friend might not give you the best answer to the question. But if you ask multiple people that are in the same field as you, they might answer your question the best. 
9006	When there is a decision to be made, it is always important to ask more than one individual for advice 
9007	it helps you know all the possible solutions, 
9008	avoid bias 
9009	learn from others' past experiences. 
9010	You need to understand every option by knowing the pros and cons before you make your decision. This helps you understand what your getting into depending on the options. I was asked to be on a basketball team that traveled around the country. I talked with my coach, parents, and family about the offer. Their opinions helped me learn the pros and cons of this opportunity. This allowed me to know what I was going to be doing if I accepted the offer. From their assistance I was able to make a choice that benefited me and my family. 
9011	We all want to make the right choice when we come across a problem. The only way to do this is to ask multiple people for advice. Asking more than one individual helps us know the options, stay away from bias, and learn from others' past experiences. Once we do this, it is our turn to choose what is the best choice.  
9012	People ask for advice and feedback almost everyday. It could be advice regarding fashion, education, or artistic feedback. For example, imagine a student finishing a project she's been working on for quite awhile. Before turning the assignment in, this student will most likely ask her peers for their opinions on it. However, notice how she won't ask one single person, rather multiple people for feedback. 
9013	Asking a single person for his opinion will only result in one perspective of the topic 
9014	. If people were to ask and receive only one response, the outcome becomes very limited and may not connect with a large audience. In order for it to apply to the audience, everyone would have to have the exact same thought process and opinions as the person the author asked; which is very unlikely. If someone wishes to connect with a variety of people, in this case a larger audience, they must have an understanding of many perspective and points of view. This way the outcome will apply to more people with different thoughts and opinions. 
9015	When someone gives feedback, it's usually based off of the original idea that was given. However, there are scenarios where the advice given provides a brand new idea regarding the topic 
9016	Asking more than one person for advice and feedback allows a person to suggest ideas and concepts one may never have thought of. To put into context, a student asks her peer for feedback regarding her art project. While most of her friends give feedback and opinions that relate to her project, one of her friends gives advice that suggests a new idea to add onto her original project. Not only does the student know how to strengthen what she has already made, she can now add a new element that benefits her assignment.  
9017	Seeking multiple opinions and advice can be beneficial to someone because it can provide new ideas that previously have never been thought of, and help understand different perspectives on the topic. It's always important to ask for assistance and feedback when you need it. Because receiving that constructive criticism and working with it reassures the outcome is successful and applies to a larger audience. Overall, asking peers for their opinions can be an eye opener, and refresh one's mind in order to get their point across a variety of people. The more feedback one receives, the stronger the outcome becomes.  
9018	you see secretly i was showing examples of people asking advice to other people, another reason of why would people ask meany other people for advice its because the person asking needs help in some way, or it needs the right advice for the right thing it wants. 
9019	Distance learning benefits students that are unable to go to school because they won't fall behind when they return and allows for time to complete assignments independently. 
9020	In 8th grade, I went on vacation for a week during the school year. When I returned to school, I had numerous of classwork assignments and tests that I had to make up. This was difficult to complete because I was expected to study for tests, finish assignments, and continue to learn new material simultaneously. Distance learning would have benefited me in this situation because had I attended my classes through video conferencing during my vacation, the amount of work I would have to had completed when I returned would have been reduced. Distance learning provides more time for students to work on assignments independently. 
9021	Distance learning is also beneficial for students who struggle in a school setting because it gives them a chance to attend class without becoming distracted of what's happening around them. 
9022	Attending classes from home can reduce the likelihood of getting others sick or becoming sick because it's impossible to spread germs from home and you are not aware of how clean your school is. 
9023	Currently, their is an virus spreading that has resulted in a pandemic in the United States. Many colleges and universities have decided to extend spring breaks and move classes online as a result of the flu-like disease. To prevent the spreading of this virus, schools decided this would be the safest option for their students because many students have gone out of the country for break and can possibly bring the virus back with them. This provides students who traveled time to be tested and cleared for school if necessary. Since most people have cleaned and cooked in their own house, they are aware of what they are eating, breathing, and touching. Students are unaware of what is done to clean the school or cook lunch food. Last year, I was eating a chicken sandwich from the lunch line that didn't appear cooked completely. I didn't think much of it until I went to the doctor and found out I received food poisoning. If I knew what was contained in the sandwich, I wouldn't have been sick. I realized that you can't always trust what you are eating or touching when you don't know how it was made or what it contains. You are aware of and immune to your house, but you aren't fully aware of how they clean in, cook in, or maintain a school. 
9024	Students will benefit from being able to attend schools from home because they won't get behind when they miss school and it reduces likelihood of getting yourself or others sick. Distance learning gives students access to school without having to attend. This benefits students who are missing school because of vacation, prefer home as an alternative learning environment, and trying to prevent illnesses from spreading. If distance learning wasn't available for students who fall into one of these three groups, they would have a difficult school experience. Distance learning is a great opportunity for students who want to attend school without having to deal with the consequences. 
9025	In the eyes of a student currently attending Generic_School, like myself, working alone can sometimes be a struggle, two minds will always be greater than one. Two minds sometimes create bias, and at times bias is good. One would benefit from hearing the other side of the argument which may ultimately end one's single-sided thinking. Also having the classroom aspect where you have multiple people who look at the same thing in different ways is important as well. Maybe the way student A looks at something is more compliant to your way of thinking rather than student B. Classmates help each other if the teacher can not, there are many instances in my learning here at Generic_School where I come to the terms of understanding a subject, but once one of my classmates broke it down for me in their way of thinking and seeing, a new light shown over the way I looked at things. 
9026	We all know where there are friends, there are foes. When you group a bunch of developing teenagers going through puberty, where emotions and hormones are swarming around, you get a sort of cesspool of emotion. Yes, at times there will be drama, fights, gossip, harassment, and many other things normal to the life of every day teens. Some may say this is a lie, but it is very well the cold hard truth. People won't always get along it's apart of the human nature, and as you're growing up you are still trying to figure out what you do or don't get along with. 
9027	One's social skills might develop more and more as time progresses and they're surrounded by situations where they are prompted to socialize with other students. Also, a student might find his or her niche, where they belong, who they really are, what they do or don't like. I can't seem to put my finger on it, but there is a difference in learning where you sit behind a screen and listen to mind numbing concepts all day, rather than sitting in a engaging classroom where you ask questions, work out problems, and get a more hands on experience.  
9028	 It's becoming too much to bare. Despite the happiness and comfort they gave you all those years ago, they've changed. They're being more critical of you and your other friends, they have been asking you for money frequently without paying back their debt, and are being rude about you not spending time with them, despite them barely spending time with you. Despite you telling them about your concerns, they haven't stopped. You think it's about time you cut ties with your closest friend that you have known since your elementary school days. You ask your mother about what you should do, and she gives you her opinion from the outside looking in. You understand her thinking, but you're not quite satisfied with her answer. You feel as if you should ask someone else, but its not because you dont respect your mom's opinion, you just want another bit of advice. Why is that? Why do we feel the need to get more than one piece of advice after already receiving what we see as a satisfactory answer? 
9029	There are more options to consider before making your decision, 
9030	you can get more diverse and varying opinions 
9031	there are just some people who are more qualified to give you the help and advice that you need.  
9032	"Now this statement may seem contradictory at first. ""How would having to go through more words, people, and ideas help me to get to a clearer understanding of my situation? Wouldn't that just cloud up everything?"" you ask. Well, actually, it does the complete opposite! If you only have one opinion, there's less of a chance that you will find the right answer. It's good to narrow down your points once everything you need is presented, but when you have little to almost nothing to go off of in the first place, it's less likely that your choice will be properly informed. Another reason that you may have trouble only going off of one person, is that somebodies advice could be very biased, which could cloud your mindset from the get go. When someone's advice is based only off of their opinion of the person or thing and not your situation or well being, it can be confusing at best, and directly harmful at worst. Finally, there are plenty more options you can choose from as well. This can make it easier to get the exact answer you need. Think about it like looking for an exact brand of paper you need for work . You may not find it at the first store you go to, you might have to drive around town to find it. All and all, having multiple opinions gives you more things to consider, making it easier to come to your conclusion. "
9033	You could get people from the outside looking in, people who have been in that situation before, and even people who might be in the same boat as you. This will make it much easier to not only narrow down your views and options, but can give you all the parts of the story you need to come to a satisfying conclusion. Next,when getting your advice from different, more diverse sources, you might just find out new information that makes you less ignorant on certain issues. When getting advice from different people, you may just find a new outlook on something you hadn't thought of before, which could open up your mind to a whole new insight of your issue. When it comes down to it, getting different opinions from a more diverse crowd could be the difference between a good and bad decision. 
9034	For example, there might be some ignorant people who know next to nothing about the other side's situation. When people dont know much about another side's struggles or even their side of the story, they may place too much of their biases onto you or your situation. Another thing, some people have more experience with giving advice. Some people are just more fit to give you advice. For example, who would you be more comfortable taking an opinion from, a friend or a therapist? You may know where to look, but its probably safer to simply get more people's opinions. Even so, sometimes people who aren't in those particular fields tend to think more simply, which might be what you need along with that professional opinion to form a bigger, clearer picture. If you're having trouble picturing what I mean, think of it like a doctor. If you get back your diagnosis and it seems wrong or misinformed, you'll probably end up asking for a second opinion. That way you get a more clear and sensible diagnosis that goes with your symptoms. Furthermore, asking different people for their opinions may just bring in some more qualified ideas into your argument.  
9035	As with many students, receiving an education and taking classes is associated with a physical school building. Students are often aware of the two main options for school: attending public/private institutions or home school. Each option offers different advantages and disadvantages but seem to be on opposite sides of a continuum. The option of taking online classes provide the benefits of both attending an in person school and home school. It can be seen as a middle ground on the continuum as taking online classes in addition to regular classes at school may increase learning 
9036	Distance learning benefits students 
9037	it can enhance learning 
9038	provide a more comfortable environment 
9039	give students the opportunity to take classes not offered at school. 
9040	Online learning can be beneficial to students who have a different learning style. They tend to be more heavily technology based which can enhance learning of those who thrive on more technology incorporated lessons and assignments. 
9041	"Because classes are taken online, the teacher or instructor utilizes different technological tools and resources for lesson plan and activities. It broadens the possibilities of how information can be delivered to students and the different class work students can participate in. Online classes can also seem a more appealing option to in person classes, as lessons and assignments tend to be more direct and straight forward. Often times, school teachers give ""fluff"" assignments that don't necessarily have a purpose or that don't offer much learning potential. These assignments are given to pass time and give students an activity to do whether in class or for homework. I have endured my share of ""fluff"" assignments throughout high school. During my sophomore year, I despised English class because I didn't seem to gain anything out of it. My teacher would assign miscellaneous assignments such as a food poem or a repetitive packet of work. Online classes tend to include less of these ""fluff"" assignments because they differ from traditional in person classes where students meet personally with teachers. There is less of a worry to keep students occupied with different assignments each class. With the Generic_School Online Campus, students are given assignments to complete each week with the due date at the end of that week. Teachers tend to give less unnecessary assignments because the class can be more spread out throughout the course. "
9042	Taking online classes from home provides students with a more comfortable learning environment. 
9043	They are in the comforts of their home and have the freedom to attain food or use the bathroom at any given time. Video conferences can be held once a week and may not even reveal a student's appearance, so students can wear whatever clothing they desire or feel most comfortable in. Students are not in the high stress school environment and can feel more relaxed. This may lead to an increase in productivity and focus on one's schoolwork. 
9044	Students can choose to take online classes or not depending on their situation and preference. While some students have distracting homes, other students can benefit from online classes as it may provide a quiet and less distracting atmosphere. Students tend to get distracted by classmates at school, so online classes may increase productivity as students can focus more on their work.  
9045	The classes offered at each school varies. Students may want to enroll in a specific class but there can be a wait list due to the popularity of the class or it may not be offered at the school. 
9046	Distance learning allows students the opportunity to take classes which would otherwise not be available. 
9047	At Generic_School, AP Latin is not a guaranteed class every year. It is entirely dependent on the amount of students who express interest in the class and sign up. When scheduling classes for next year, I requested to take AP Latin, however, if the class will not be available, I will take the class online. With this option of taking online classes, my education will not be hindered or limited. Students should have the opportunity to take whichever class they wish without any restrictions or limitations. Distance learning effectively prevents this situation from occurring with the availability and different offerings of classes. 
9048	The argument can be made that attending classes from home does not allow students to develop communication and social skills because of the decrease in social interaction. 
9049	However, students can develop and hone these skills with continuing to take in person classes at school. 
9050	Online classes can be taken in addition or in combination with traditional classes at school. 
9051	Distance learning can enhance education, increase productivity with its more comfortable environment, and expand course selection opportunities for students, but online classes still remain an additional option for students. Students extremely benefit from online classes. Schools must promote and encourage students to take online classes or at the very least, ensure students are aware of this opportunity as an alternative to in person classes. Distance learning provides numerous benefits, and students who take advantage of online classes will have a more enriched education experience.                    
9052	When you are asking someone about what you should do in a certain situation, you value their opinions and statements but are they the only person you should be asking? 
9053	Talking and asking for advice from multiple sources is always the way to go when you need help. Just think, using one persons experience is nothing compared to a range of different experiences, backgrounds, thoughts, ideas, etc. 
9054	If you ask multiple people for advice you would get tons of point of views you have never seen or even thought of, 
9055	help you think clearly and put things into perspective just a little more 
9056	youll be able to point things out that youve just glanced over. 
9057	Asking different people advice on a certain subject will provide you will an immense amount of stuff you didnt talk about and or stuff you didnt even think about. Bringing in different point of views into a two or more person situation will help you decide on whats the best choice to make. Talking to other people will also allow an opportunity for the other person to give you important key facts to your situation. They might bring up past experiences they have had or that their friend has had in the past, they might even be in the same position as you are right now. In the end no matter how hard or difficult your situation is its always better to get extra help and advice along the way. 
9058	By attending school from home, students would be unfocused and miss out on opportunities that only a physical school can provide. A school provides a specified location completely dedicated to learning. 
9059	 Many homes that house one or more students are normally very busy place. Take an average middle class family, around two parents and three children. At least one parent has work, so they are away for they majority of the day. The other parent must now be the one to shuttle the students to doctors appointments, and cannot leave them home. The parent would have to decide between taking their children to everywhere the parent goes, and distracting the children from education, or leaving them home alone. Either the students would not be able to focus on their work, or the parent would not get anything useful done. Say they had a nanny to watch the children while the parents work. Now the children have to be impossibly restrained to keep themselves from bothering each other. Imagine trying to focus on a physics lecture while trying to stop a young child from coming into your room screaming 
9060	. Even if the conditions at home are completely perfect, a student needs to somehow remain completely focused. A screen with colors and sounds coming out of it does not hold one responsible as well as an in person teacher. 
9061	"The distractions could range from ""just taking a break"" to ""just getting some fresh air"" to ""I'm just going to go to the movies"". There is no real way the teacher could stop them. Many students lack self-control, or need to be taught it. These students would never learn that they can not just leave because something bores them. All, but especially young students would find focusing extremely difficult when not being held accountable. "
9062	 Suppose the distractions are not an issue. A student sits down at his computer, switches it on, and is greeted by a neon light and artificial sounds. After the lecture, the student reaches out, switches the screen off, and takes a nap. This seems completely fine, but the student is missing a very crucial step; actual human interaction. This is vital for any functioning adult. No matter what job one has, they will always have to interact with another human. 
9063	If a students life consists of just wake up, eat, watch a lecture, do the work, eat, go to sleep, then they miss out on human interaction other than their direct family for nearly eighteen years. That is absolutely not an ideal trade for the luxury of learning from home.  
9064	Some classes are altogether impossible to attend online. 
9065	How would any musician learn to play in a group? Would they turn up the computer volume all the way just to hear a few other people? How would they play together if there is a delay in transmission? That completely rules out all of the musical department. What about workshop classes? Are the students expected to purchase thousands of dollars of machinery just to do a school project? Now the only classes available online are the ones that just pump your head full of words and facts. Nearly all schools also have extracurricular sports. These sports are much cheaper and easier to participate in than private clubs. Online, students can not exactly throw a baseball to each other. They would instead have to pay hundreds of dollars, even if they made they very selective tryouts. 
9066	Sticky situations, we've all been through one of those in our lives. It may not always be a sticky situation, instead, just a tough decision your going to have to make. Making your own decision can lead to either a positive outcome or a negative outcome, but in order to prevent that you can talk to more than one person before making a decision. 
9067	Talking to more than one person before a choice or decision can be beneficial in many ways. 
9068	For example, Bill Gates at a young age used to work with Steve Jobs who was a very successful businessman behind the company Apple, and Steve Jobs didnt quite acknowledge a young,bright,open-minded,intelligent  Bill Gates. Bill Gates knew that he was very smart but he had a really tough choice to make, that choice was to either surprise the world and make his own dynasty out of a company or stick with  Steve Job's Apple, What came to Bill Gates mind was that he wanted to stay with Steve Jobs  Because he was already very popular and high marketing, but before making a decision he went on and asked a few people and those people had a thought in mind that Bill Gates is very smart and that with his knowledge and study he could easily thrash Steve Jobs. Bill Gates listened to his friends and after years of work and study he made his own Company Microsoft and shocked the world and is now recognized as one of the most successful businessman in the world and one of the most wealthy as well. 
9069	when you ask people to assist you on a tough choice your going to have to make you will most likely end up making the right choice. 
9070	Now say if you were shopping at a local convenience store and one day you saw a bunch of money on the floor, you have no idea where it came from but still decided to take some money. Then the next day you think of all the bad outcomes that can happen all because of the money you decided to take secretly, what you could have done to make a better choice was to ask multiple people or at least someone else. Because that way the person could have told you to ask the cashier at the store if they knew someone reported that they lost their money or to just leave it their and maybe the owner of the money could comeback and take back their money. But that still can leave you with a feeling of regret, so what you can do next time is ask someone to give you advice before making an action so you don't end up with a feeling of regret. 
9071	they wouldn't know how to function in a work environment, 
9072	and they wouldn't have the work motivation to complete their assignments.  
9073	An important reason that causes online classes to be unbeneficial is the inability to create social interaction skills. 
9074	"When students attend school, they have to communicate with other students and teachers. Therefore, students learn how to correctly interact with others, and build good relationships. However if a student is taking classes online, they wouldn't be obligated to actually communicate with peers in person. Having the ability to talk to others is a very important skill for their working careers in the future. During a career you will be forced to interact with many people such as, co-workers, costumers, and clients. Therefore, attending school is a great way to obtain those skills by talking to other students and their teachers. Furthermore, It is also a great way to build friendships with kids their age. Having friends can change the overall experience to a childhood because it can lead to a life necessity called ""fun"". Life wouldn't be the same if I didn't have people that I could call my friend because learning can be more interesting if you're experiencing it with people you know and trust. Lastly when a student can build relationships with their teachers, not only does it give you an easier learning environment, but it also provides an adult that you can ask questions or talk to. I have good relationships with many of my teachers, therefore allowing me to have a great experience in school. I am able to go to them if I ever need something or if I'm confused about a certain topic. Relationships with teachers can also ""make or break"" your experiences in your classes. When you look up to your teacher, it's more likely for you to want to learn what they are teaching because you have respect for them. Overall, having social interaction skills is very important for a good learning experience, and for everyday life in the future. "
9075	Another life necessity that a student would not obtain by taking online classes is being able to function in a work environment. 
9076	Many jobs and careers require you to work under a schedule. This being said, if you are used to working at your own pace and on your own time, you will not be prepared to be in the working environment. Unfortunately, this can lead to the loss of your job and other opportunities because you can be considered unreliable. Furthermore if a student is used to working in a quiet area in their home, they can be at risk of not knowing how to handle busy and loud work environments. This can restrain them from being able to complete any of their work, therefore making them insufficient. When a place of business gets extremely busy, a lot of stress can be put on the employees. Attending school allows a person to be introduced to those types of conditions at an early stage, therefore making you more prepared for them than students who take online classes. Online classes do not prepare you for the real world, which can lead to a rude awakening in the future. 
9077	Lastly, a lack of work motivation is another important reason to online classes being unbeneficial compared to going to a school. Students can find it hard to get the motivation to complete their assignments 
9078	"With the flexibility of online classes, students can start getting the idea of pushing school work aside to focus on other things. Unfortunately this mentality can get extremely out of hand, for their grades can start to suffer and their work load can pile up. Many students experience this chain reaction, therefore causing a lot of stress that can lead them to giving up. Having the access to attending a school decreases the ability to start this chain reaction because facing a teacher due to you not completing your work can be intimidating. Furthermore, going to your classes in person also gives you more work motivation because most of time you don't have the option to sit around and do nothing. Your teachers encourage you to ""use your time wisely"" when you are given the opportunity to complete your assignments during class, therefore giving students the extra push to actually do their work. When students are able to work on their own schedule due to taking online classes, it opens the opportunity to be lazy and not complete school work. This leads to students drowning in work because of their lack of work motivation.  "
9079	I think that students would not benefit from attending classes from home because they wouldn't learn the ability to interact with people, they wouldn't do well in a work environment, and they wouldn't have the motivation to complete their work. Students who take online classes are isolated, therefore they are at larger risk to having rough experiences in the future due to not being prepared for the real world. They will not have the skills needed for everyday life, which can lead them to failure. However, attending an actual school gives you these life skills, therefore giving you a better chance of being successful in the career of your choice. You are also given the opportunity to making friends who can last a lifetime, and building relationships with teachers who can guide you in the right direction to being successful in life as well. 
9080	Seeking advice from multiple people allows for learning from others' experiences, 
9081	more inclusive actions 
9082	different perspectives on issues. 
9083	 When I was deciding whether I should apply to Awesome Math Summer Program, a prestigious math overnight camp at Cornell University, I was debating if this would be a worthwhile experience for me. It would have been the first ever time I stayed away from home by myself, and I was nervous I wouldn't make any friends. The camp was also highly priced, and I didn't want to put financial burden on my parents, who were already paying for my brother's expensive private college. However, Awesome Math Summer Program is known for the classes it offers, all of which would greatly benefit me as a competitive math student. Many of the courses there were perfect for my math level, and would provide a challenge I wasn't getting in normal school math. Many of my friends said it was a great experience, but I didn't know if they were providing me the whole truth on what the camp was like. I was very conflicted on what my plan of action should be, so I turned to another person who I knew had past experience and could guide me through my decision making. My brother had already attended Awesome Math Summer Program a few years back, and he said although it wasn't suited for his style of learning, it would be a great fit for me. The lessons were more problem solving based, which was my favorite type of class. His knowledge of the program allowed me to make the best decision regarding my application to Awesome Math Summer Program, which in the end I did apply and get accepted to. My brother's advice from his own personal experiences gave me a look into a camp I wouldn't have had otherwise, and allowed me to have one of the best summers of my life. His and others' advice played a large role in me attending this program, and also have made me more including of others. 
9084	In sixth grade, I was student council president of my school, and one of the topics many students wanted me to address was on bullying. I didn't know how exactly I could help students going through this horrible ordeal, because many victims of bullying don't like to stand up for fear of more shame. When I consulted with teachers, students, and my parents, they all had an overarching idea of focusing on kindness and the prevention of bullying, instead of bullying itself. This was something I never thought of before and never would have been able to think of, but with the aid of many others, I was able to form a new idea for approaching bullying in my school. I established a wristband kindness program, where wristbands were given out to students who were seen doing kind acts, such as helping another student without being asked or holding the door open at recess. When those students saw another student doing a thoughtful deed, they would pass on the bracelet and continue the spread of kindness. This motivated many young children to become more generous and understanding, a trait that will take them far in life. This idea wouldn't have even have been possible if it weren't for all the kids and teachers that helped me decide what I should focus on as student council president, as well as giving me the ideas for the project. I was able to develop a more inclusive program from multiple opinions, which also helps provide different viewpoints in conflicts. 
9085	The judicial branch has the complicated job of making some of the most difficult decisions in our country. During the Supreme Court case of Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeir, the justices had to decide if school officials could censor the school newspaper, or if this was violation of First Amendment Rights. They worked together to deliberate the most Constitutionally fair outcome, and formed the majority opinion based off of what most justices thought was the best ruling 
9086	Each justice was able to provide their own perspective on the issue, which is especially important for court cases since everyone has different ideas on what is fair. 
9087	In the end, they ruled the First Amendment did not prohibit schools from censoring the school newspaper. They were able to reach this ruling from countless hours spent in debate of the conflict, and make a fair decision based off of everyone's unique perspective. The opinions from multiple individuals help make the most just decision in a court case, as well as help decision making in real life. 
9088	Most decisions do not require much in-depth analyzing, but there are some can be very hard and draining to make. No matter how exhausting this can be though, there are always methods to make decision making more bearbale. One way to make this easier is to seek the advice of more than one person, as this can lead to the best choice. Others who have already been through what you are going to can give helpful advice, as well as make more inclusive decisions and give a different view on issues. From this, a person can take the best and most fair actions to help them succeed. 
9089	"The other day I asked my mother for advice about boys. I think that I am coming-of-age, and I want to know how to get a guy's attention. I asked my mother, ""How can I get guys to notice me?"" My mother looked at me puzzled for a few minutes. Later, she responds with, ""Honey, all you have to do is flirt!"" Little did she know, flirting was not in my vocabulary. Soon after, my sister comes into the room, from eavesdropping, and says, ""That's not true, mom! You need to listen to me, sister. All you have to do is be yourself. If a guy doesn't like you for who you are, then they aren't worth your time."" All of a sudden my grandma, who hasn't been out on a date for a while, says, ""Darling, don't listen to them. What you have to do is act dumb. Guys will be chasing your tail if you do that."" Everyone started to bicker back and forth for a while. After gathering all of the advice I got, I started thinking,  ""I know what to do!"" "
9090	getting advice from more than one person has better outcomes. 
9091	you have more options to choose from, 
9092	someone may have trouble answering your question, 
9093	you may end up finding someone who has more knowledge about your question. 
9094	When I asked my mom for advice, she gave me an answer I wasn't quite comfortable doing. Also, if it wasn't my sister and grandma, I would have been stuck flirting, which is uncomfortable for me. At the end of the day, I had a lot of opinions from different people, and it was my choice to choose the one I feel is better for me. If you don't feel comfortable with an answer, then ask someone else. Doing so, you may be able to get a different outcome. Also, the person you originally asked may have trouble giving you the right answer. 
9095	When I asked my mom for help, she looked at me with a confused face and paused for a long time. I think it was because she never thought of me asking that question before. As a result, she couldn't think of an answer on the spot. She still gave me good advice, but it did seem as if she had trouble answering me. If you ever have someone who can't give you an answer easily, the best choice is to ask someone else. They may have the abilities to give you a well thought out answer. Lastly, another person may have more knowledge about the subject, so they may be able to help you more efficiently. 
9096	my sister is in college, and she is taking a social development class. Believe it or not, she learned about the difficulties of confrontation with the opposite gender. In that class, she learned about what not to do when you are talking to a male or female. Which means she knows a lot more about my question then my grandma. My grandma hasn't been out on a date in forty-five years. As a result, she isn't the best person to give advice about talking to boys. In the end, if you want a good answer to a question you have, you should go to multiple people who can help you. 
9097	Imagine yourself in a stressful situation causing you to be confused and frustrated because you cannot form a legitimate solution. In this situation your problem may be dire, but the usage of advice from others can help you. Through everyday life, we are constantly finding ourselves in troubling circumstances. Gaining advice from multiple sources is a powerful way to combat our problems. Often, it is advice and guidance from others that provides us with the strength and expertise needed to resolve conflict. Support from friends or family and assertive words can be just what we need when dealing with a problem. 
9098	Asking multiple sources for advice can influence you to make better decisions  
9099	you learn different perspectives, 
9100	gain knowledge from others who have dealt with similar circumstances, 
9101	realize the multiple ways to solve the problem.  
9102	When seeking advice from others, we likely already have a favored position on the topic. Sometimes, we search for reassurance and not advice. However, questioning others about our situations is better for the outcome of the experience because it brings us new perspectives. Perspective can be key to finding the solution to a problem because it allows one to look at the problem as a whole, and not just from a biased position. When blinded by a biased perspective, we force ourselves to ignore different outlooks on the situation. It is when we remove that toxic blindfold that we realize whether we are truly in the wrong or what is the true source of the conflict. Having different perspectives will only provide you with a more sincere and graceful approach to dealing with a problem. 
9103	Specifically, it is more beneficial when you ask others who have dealt with similar experiences for help. When we do this, we find ourselves relating to others and taking their advice into greater consideration. Through this method, we gain knowledge on possible outcomes for our conflict and how it can be resolved. While filtering our own bias with this new information, we can formulate possible solutions for ourselves. This is an intriguing way that we can all solve our problems because we can use the experiences of others to better our own. Using the lessons learned by others to prevent yourself from carrying the same misfortunes is a key way to avoid conflict. This strategy allows yourself to feel more comfortable about handling the problem because you know someone who has dealt with the same thing. No matter how complex a problem can be, empathy from another who can relate will make the situation better. 
9104	It is inevitable that the more people you ask, the more likely you are to hear different opinions and opposing responses. This is a natural occurrence considering that as humans, we all have unique experiences that effect how we look at situations. Through asking others for possible solutions, we can find one that correlates best with how we feel. Sometimes it takes getting a large collection of advice from different sources to piece together a comfortable solution. We can carve away bits and pieces from that block of advice to sculpt our resolution. When seeking advice, we can act as detectives to collect the different fragments of advice and piece it together to form a conclusion. 
9105	As a result of us collectively having different experiences in life, we get to provide one another with new thoughts and ideas through giving advice. The process of seeking multiple opinions can provide you with a guaranteed and better outcome for handling a pressing conflict. You can also recognize the many ways one can look at the situation. As well as, recognize the results from of others when they went through the same occurrence, and the multiple ways you can resolve the situation. Having a myopic mind can be a true curse, and taking advice from others prohibits yourself from making consequential mistakes because of being blinded by bias. Talking to others who have dealt with the similar problem allows you to feel more comfortable in your situation, and gain some peace in being to relate to another. Having others provide with different ways they would resolve the situation allows you to consider the many options and pick the best one for your situation. Friends, family, associates and the others in your life all have access to the information you need to make the best decision for yourself. When dealing with conflict, it would be most beneficial to use their knowledge to prevent your problems from troubling you intensely.        
9106	Asking more than one person is better than asking just one person. 
9107	If you ask one person for advice its not the best because you are only getting one idea. 
9108	If you ask more than one person like 10 people than thats better because you have lots of different ideas and opinions. 
9109	Moreover, students need more intense requirement for self-direction because you have to know study online is good or bad for you. 
9110	Base on this argument, students shouldn't being able to attend classes from home and study in online or video conferencing. I think study in online or video are very bad for you because you will low experience, knowledge, and low contact with your teachers. You have to contact with your teachers because It will help you are more creation,experience and understand about confusion in your paragraph or homework. If you know the positive and negative, you can make an informed decision whether online learning right for you. 
9111	Gathering multiple opinions helps people make better choices by giving them multiple viewpoints. These new viewpoints can give them various new way to approach the decision. By having multiple ways to approach the problem, you can choose the best one and make the best decision. 
9112	Asking someone for advice can make you realize an option that you haven't thought of yet. 
9113	Sometimes you think that you can only choose one of two or three options. However, when you ask someone else for advice, they might notice an option that you hadn't noticed that's even better. One time I had a track meet on my friends birthday. I wanted to go to his birthday party and celebrate with him, but my team really needed me to run the mile event because I had the fastest mile time out of the team. I asked my coach if it would be okay if I missed the meet, then he told me that I could just run the mile and then leave afterward. I hadn't thought of that because usually, everyone runs all the events just to give each team a better chance at the fastest time. So decided to leave early for my friend's party. I ended up winning the mile event, and then having a great time at my friend's party. Not only does asking for advice give you new options, but it can help you think through your existing options more thoroughly. 
9114	"By gaining a different viewpoint of the decision, you could notice new pros and cons that you hadn't thought of for each option. At the beginning of this year I was deciding whether or not I wanted to apply for Generic_School. When I was deciding if I wanted to apply, I was mostly thinking about how hard to application process would be. Only really intelligent people get into Generic_School, and I wasn't sure if I had a good enough chance of getting in. I focused mostly on whether or not I was going to make it in, and if the probability of me getting in was worth the effort. When I asked my dad for advice he said ""do you even want to go to Generic_School?"" He told me that going to Generic_School was really stressful and time consuming, and many of the people there spend almost all of there time studying and doing work. Those were things that I had not considered before. I realized that Generic_School wasn't for me, so I ended up not applying. The different viewpoints that you get, can come from other experiences, and be applied to your own. "
9115	Other people can sometime give you advice because have gone through a similar choice. 
9116	"If you ask someone for advice, they may be able to take something they learned from a choice they had to make. You can apply that to the decision that you need to make. When I was in fifth grade, I was in my last year of Cub Scouts and I was getting ready to cross over into Boy Scouts. I had to choose what Boy Scout troop I wanted to cross over to. I couldn't decide on which one I wanted to go to, so I asked my great uncle, who was a very successful scout, how he decided which troop he wanted to join. He told me to ""find a group of scouts that I would enjoy sharing a meal or a tent with, because if you have that, your time in scouting will be much more enjoyable."" That advice led me to Generic_Name, they were all really nice people, so I ended up joining their troop. Four years later I'm still enjoying Boy Scouts, I've gone on dozens of camping trips, and made some of my best friends. Asking my great uncle for advice was really helpful in that situation. "
9117	Everybody faces obstacles throughout their lives whether it is as simple as getting up from bed to something as complex as purchasing a new house. During these times, people may choose to seek advice from others thinking that they could help them make a better decision. However, some people may choose to not seek advice from others because they think others will not be able help them. 
9118	I think that seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. 
9119	others can share their ideas, 
9120	they can ensure that the research and information is all accurate, 
9121	it creates a unbiased choice. 
9122	For example, if a teacher was buying a new car, they would want to spend as much time as possible researching for the best car they could buy. However, even if they spent that much time, they could still end up buying a car that they end up not liking. Although if they asked others for advice, others may be able to share things from their own experience. They may have owned the car that the teacher wanted previously. If the teacher asked them whether it was a good purchase or not, they could share things that the teacher would have never found on the internet. Now the teacher has learned a lot more and has more information to make the right decision. That is why when others share their ideas, it could help someone make a better choice. 
9123	If the person researches and ends up compiling a ton of inaccurate information, that won't help them at all. This is very likely as many sources online can be inaccurate. Although 
9124	Back to the car example, lets say someone told the teacher that the car they wanted to buy was a bad choice. However, the teacher disagreed with him and she told him something that was completely incorrect. Others would be able to point this out and make sure that the information she found was 100% true and that her research does not have any false information that could affect her final decision. This allows someones information to be more accurate. 
9125	If the teacher just asked the manager in a Toyota car dealership about what car she should purchase, the manager would most likely recommend a car from Toyota because he would want to advertise his dealership. However this would make her choice extremely biased especially if the manager didn't provide details to back up his claim. It doesn't have to be the manager of a car dealership either. If the teacher just asked someone who simply likes Toyota, she would still get the same answer. When someone asks for multiple opinions, it prevents the chance of her choice being too biased. This allows someone to make a better choice without having tons of biased opinions influencing them.  
9126	I believe that seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. This is because others could share the information and experiences that they have had or been through. They can also make sure that the information they have is accurate. Everyone's opinions could create a choice that is less-biased. By compiling what everyone shares, others will have the necessary experiences and the accurate research to make the best unbiased decision. 
9127	relive the ongoing stress, 
9128	help you focus on the conquences of others opinions, 
9129	you can make the decision faster. 
9130	Many people struggle with horrible stress and it can be really hard. Having all this weight on your shoulders can bring you down. You can go into a bad mind set and want to give up. It can be very diffcult to relive your stress sometimes. Asking for other peoples opinions when making a decision, can help you. It will make it easier for you because you have friends to be there for you during the stressful times. When I make a hard decision I like to take care of myself. Giving yourself love and care can relive stress too, during hard times. You do not want to have your stress get in the way of your school, or sports. Stress can make you forget about what is important and make you just focus on that one thing. That is why when you ask for help it can also, help relive your stress.  
9131	The first step to make a good decision is to think about your conquences. Some people make a decision and regret it because they did not think about their conquences. For example, when people go to jail, they regret their descision they made because it changed their life in a horrible way. Other peoples opinions can lead you into a bad direction, if you dont think about the possible outcomes. There can be some bad outcomes when you listen to peoples opinions, but if you chose carefully and follow the correct steps it will not be so bad. If someone is per-persuring you, that is never the right way to listen someones advice because they are forcing you. Always listen to yourself when someone is forcing you and not always be a follower, but also listen to other opinons when they are not forcing you. 
9132	Having the help of others advice, can lead you into making the right decision. 
9133	If you ask for help, you might not have so much stress, therefore you might make the decision faster. Making it faster will mean you will have less stress, you wont have to worry about it so much, and you can just move on and enjoy it. When something goes by faster you can just think about the furture and not worry so much on the present. You can make other decisions too, do fun stuff with friends, instead of thinking and worrying about one thing. School might be less stressful because you will not be carring so much weight on your shoulders and you will focus more. Everyone already knows school is so stressful, so making one little thing less stressful can help you focus a lot more. This will make your teachers very proud because they will see you focus more on your work and not be so worked up. You might even do better on test and your grades will be better because you are actually focused instead of worrying about everything. 
9134	Seeking multiple opinions on a topic can help somone make a better choice because, the person gets different points of veiw. 
9135	Asking for advice by multiple sources can help the person become aware of possible bias or non-bias answers, which they may encounter if they only ask one person. 
9136	For example, say you need advice on whether or not to get a dog or a cat as a pet. What would happen if you did seek advice? What would happen if you didn't? What kind of opinions would you become aware of?  You are unsure whether a dog or cat is a right pet for you. You decide to ask the advice from multiple others by different sources. One person you ask is completely against dogs; this person is being biased as they are telling you how they believe cats are better than dogs, only because they have one. They list the negative qualities of dogs, and list the positive qualities of cats, something you consider.  The same thing in the above paragraph happens with a dog lover, who advises you get a dog, which in their opinion, is better than a cat. This person has a dog, and is being biased aswell. This enables you to get different opinions on your question by seeing both sides of the story. The dog lover, like the cat lover, now tells you the negative qualities of cats, then the positive qualities of dogs. You can now make a better choice on which pet to get that suits you.  Now, say you didn't ask for any other opinion and decide to get a dog. Since you didn't seek out others advice, you find that this dog needs too much exercise, is always hungry, and doesn't leave you alone. You are unhappy with your choice since you didn't seek out all the possible information from others. 
9137	asking multiple people for their opinion helps you make a better choice to decied what best suits you, opens your eyes to different points of view, or possibilities. You now know the pros and cons for your question, you may even be able to relate to an opinion more, helping you decide on an option. In the end, you happily go home with a cat.  
9138	Sometimes we need advice, and asking one person for advice just doesn't provide you with the right advice you are in need of. When we ask more than one person it can benefit us, because each answer is so diverse and it is seen from a different perspective. When its one person, you only hear their bit of advice, and sometimes you need a little something more. 
9139	When you ask more than one person, you can get a lot of good feedback therefore, you could have a lot good advice to use, whcih is another benefit of asking multiple people for advice. 
9140	Sometimes to recieve good advice, it is all in who you ask, because maybe asking people your age or younger may not be the right people to ask but older people may be the right ones, and vise versa. Here is a good example of asking one person versus many people for advice. When trasforming from child teen, we need advice about what's happening and what to do and what not to do. In this case older people would be the people to ask, because they have been through it and they probably have made the same mistakes as you, therefore that would be their expertise. For younger people you could ask advice on what clothes to pick for school and other easier things that they'd be better at advising you with. 
9141	You can always ask as many people as you want, because everyone is different, and different people have different answers that can help you out. 
9142	If they are a bad influence on people, you should definitely not ask those types of people for advice, because they could lead you in the wrong direction. Look for people you know will be helpful and who will try to point you in the right direction to get you on the right road. Stray away from asking mischeveous people, and go for people who try to do good things. 
9143	It is always good start with adults when asking for advice, because they were kids once too, and they may know a lot even if they didn't grow up in the same generation. Many grew up differently, and the different responses can come in handy. 
9144	In the end we realize asking multiple people for advice even if they are young or old, is the way to go, because it will benefit you the most. Whatever the advice you need may be, asking many is the beneficial thing to do. So next time you are in need of advice remember these key things to look for and follow, then ask away. Remember the more people the more answers, the more you'll understand the advice, and the better decision you will make. This is why asking multiple people versus one is the right way to ask advice.  
9145	When making decisions people often look to others for advice. Whether the decision be where to go for lunch or something that would alter your life people seek others opinion. Often times going to more than one person to get advice can be a very beneficial thing to do. 
9146	Getting more than one opinion can be very helpful since it gives you more outlook on the question at hand 
9147	Going to other for advice can really open your eyes to all sides of your dilemma. 
9148	Perhaps you want to apply to a school and are having a hard time deciding whether to apply or not. Asking someone who may have gone to that school or had experience with something like that would be helpful because they know what its like. Then for another opinion talk to someone close to you like a friend or a family member to see if they think it would be a good fit for you specifically. These people also may see things that you dont in a situation. Seeing multiple sides of the decision in question really helps to make a clear decision. 
9149	Some of the people you would want to talk to probably have more experience than you do. 
9150	This would be optimal considering they have already gone through something very similar and know which choices have a bad outcome. A family member, close friend, or anyone you trust really would be a good option for this. If they are older than you its likely they had to make some similar decision and will relate to you and your situation and try their best to help aid you in making a good choice. These people that have more experience in life and are willing to help you really make the difference and help you make the best choice possible. 
9151	After asking all these people and taking into consideration all of their opinions there should be a pretty clear final decision. 
9152	Since you've asked all of these people you should be able to confidently make a good choice that will benefit you. Going into something like a job or a try out is optimal for success. All in all more opinions makes a stronger and more sound conclusion to the problem at hand.  An example of this from my past experience would be when I tried out for junior varsity softball at Generic_School. I wasnt sure if trying out was gonna benefit me at all considering i'm in 8th grade and many of the girls out there have many more years of experience. I went to my dad for advice since he played junior varsity and has also seen me play. In his opinion he didnt think I should try out because its a lot to take on during 8th grade. Then I went to some of my friends for their opinion on it and they gave me the confidence to go and try out. Right now Im on the softball team and very happy with the choice I made to try out. 
9153	I believe talking to more then one person is the best thing you can do if you need advice. Although it can be difficult to talk to people for advice, I believe that it can help you deeply. And now here are some reasons why you should talk to one or more people if you need advice. 
9154	For example when i needed help with a deciding if i should still be friends with some people. I asked my dad and my siblings for advice, my dad told me that if they dont make me feel good then I should not be friends with them. On the other hand my siblings told me that I should be friends with them because they said that I had so much fun with them and good times. Then I had to make a decision, and it was a tough decision but I ended up still being friends with them, the reason i stayed friends with them was because we had very good times and I did not want that to end. So me and my friends apologized to each other and we became friends again. 
9155	Having multiple opinions is important, but also just having someone to talk to can be just as important for having advice.  The next reason is having someone to talk to, this can help you for multiple reasons like getting better advice and being happy 
9156	For example my cousin Generic_Name was acting very strangely and I knew something was wrong, so I asked him what was wrong and he did not want to tell me anything. So then i asked my dad about Generic_Name and he said he is probably going through some stuff and that I should give him some space. So I did, after a couple weeks I started noticing that he was feeling better and I asked him what was wrong. And he told me that he was stressed out because he had a lot off projects due. Then I asked him how did you feel better and he told me that he talked to his mom and teachers to find a solution. Although he was stressed out and he did not want to talk to people he did talk to people and it got better. 
9157	Having someone to talk to is very important for advice but just making better decisions from having multiple peoples advice is just as important.  The final reason is making better decisions, making better decisions can impact your life majorly 
9158	For example I saw this TV show named beyond scared straight, and it was about kids who have done bad things that go to jail for a day, and they talk to inmates and see how making bad decision can lead you into jail. Then on one of the episodes there was a kid named Generic_Name, and he was on beyond scared straight, and after seeing the jail and getting advice from the inmates, officers and other people he still ended up in jail. So then more kids came into the jail and saw Generic_Name, and Generic_Name gave them advice and all the kids were scared because one small mistake could lead you in to jail. and after that none of the other kids there got into jail, because they made the right decision from Generic_Name's and other people's advice.  Making the best decisions are very important, but know lets take a review. 
9159	Receiving multiple opinions from different people can help out a lot. Sometimes when people ask for advice, they don't always want to follow that specific person's advice. This is why receiving multiple opinions is better for some people. 
9160	Seeking multiple opinions can help because it can allow you to understand through different point of views, 
9161	It can help to get ideas on what you should do, 
9162	it allows people to understand where you're coming from. 
9163	They might have a different perspective on what you think you should do, or what someone else thinks you should do, because we all think differently. Understanding where people are coming from, even if you disagree can also help you come up with one executive decision. For example, there could be an occasion where you want these nice shoes , but you don't have enough money so you go and ask for people's advice on what you should do. One person says, ask a family member for the money. You ask another person, they say steal the shoes from the store. In this scenario it allows you to think and understand what both people are trying to say and the benefits of each and then you can come down to which is a better choice. Stealing shoes from the store could get you in a lot of trouble, So the clear choice is to ask a family member. 
9164	If they try to take a step in your shoes, and feel how your feeling about the situation then they can process and understand exactly whats happening and what they have to say about it. For example, if you are really sad about something and you talk to your friends about it, it allows them to feel empathy, and try to understand why you are sad, and what they can do to help you. Them seeing things through your point of view allowed them to feel what you are feeling which is why its easy and beneficial to get advice from multiple people. Especially people you trust. 
9165	Making a choice is not always an easy thing to do. Wether it's tyring to figure out what you should order on the menu, or a bigger decision like which college you should attend. However big or small the choice is, there are always people around you that can help you find the answer and give you their input on what you should do. Asking for the advice of people you trust can be really eye opening. 
9166	Seeking advice from multiple people can help you make your decision much more clear and help you make a better choice. Sometimes, all it takes is a few people's input that will impact your life. 
9167	If you seek advice from many people, and most or all of those people are saying the same thing, then the choice becomes much more clear. For example, if you're debating wether or not to take all honors next year, and all of your teachers are telling you you should do honors, then the choice to take all honors becomes clear. Seeking advice from only one person might not make your mind up as quickly as talking to many people. Having one of your teachers telling you to do all honors might not be as impactful as having most of your teachers telling you to do all honors. 
9168	Talking to multiple people can make you think of new ideas on what to do. If you are really not sure about a decision, people can show you many paths of which you can go down. Having another option can make your decision even more clear. For example, if you're deciding over going to Greece or Italy for your vacation, and other people you talk to are mentioning Paris, you might consider going to Paris instead which you haven't even thought of in the first place.  
9169	you can learn from people's past experiences. 
9170	Learning about people's past experiences can really change your perspective. If you're talking to multiple people about wether to do something or not, and those people say not to because it didn't go well for them in the past, then the choice to not do that certain something becomes much more clear. For example, if you're not sure if you want to go cliff-diving, and the people you talk to are all saying you shouldn't because they got hurt while doing it, then the choice becomes pretty clear to not go cliff-diving.  
9171	Talking to multiple different people about a decision can be very helpful because you can get different point of views. 
9172	Getting different point of views and opinions can be helpful sometimes because it can make you think totally different from what you were thinking before. It can lead to new paths you want to go down. Though getting different point of views can also be tricky sometimes because it can make you even more conflicted then you already were. But a lot of the time, different opinions can lead to more options and oppurtunities. 
9173	Getting other people's input on a choice is important because if you're really split on a decision, the people you seek advice from might make the choice a lot more clear. If you really trust the people you seek advice from, then your choice should be made easily. There's nothing wrong with seeking advice from others sometimes. Sometimes making choices on your own can be very difficult and all it takes is other peoples' different opinions and point of views. You might just need to hear that advice that pushes you into the right direction. 
9174	Most of us, as human beings, need other's help for certain things. Whether that be for school work or friendship advises, we all need someone's help at least once in our lives. When we are uncertain of something, we often times ask for help from the people around us 
9175	Having multiple people to ask and consult with is a great idea rather than just having one. Seeking help from multiple people can have great benefits, 
9176	Our opinions are shaped by other's opinions through out our lives. In order to build an opinion to take action or maybe to just keep it to ourselves, we must learn new angles and learn new opinions. 
9177	Just as if it was math, the current knowledge is to be built on prior knowledge, it's no different for having an opinion. We are heavily influenced by the people around us, such as our parents or friends. When we combine the opinions of others on a situation, we can gather them up to make one solution. It's like adding pieces of a puzzle to make one grand masterpiece, we add the opinions of others to make our own opinion. There are multiple times when I have an opinion on something, such as a hobby, person, or situation and when other's share their opinions on it, sometimes I learn new things from them! It opens up a door to a new way of thinking and makes me more open minded. Asking for other's advises to build your own thought is a great way to learn what other's think and to also have a reliable idea.  
9178	People often say to ask advice from your parents or any adults around you because they're older. They're older so they have more experience which can come in handy. 
9179	Having anyone that has gone through the same or a similar situation as yourself can help you avoid other mistakes or help you out in a situation in general. It's a wise idea to ask for advice or the opinions of others who have more experience in whatever you need help with. It's more likely you're going to go ask a math teacher for your math homework rather than your English teacher. It's just a good idea to ask someone for help for something when that person knows something about the topic. Even if you do know about the matter, it doesn't hurt to get more insight about it! 
9180	It's always better to stay safe than to say sorry. When people are in a tough situation, it's always good to have people behind you. Getting the opinions of others gives you multiple people to turn to in case you need them. 
9181	It's a great idea to talk to multiple people about something that is bothering you or you are curious about rather than one. It doesn't hurt to ask for other's opinions and it's always a good thing to do at the end. We can achieve something or resolve the problem better if we get the help of others. Someone's opinion may shape your own opinion in a totally different way and it's smart to understand and use other's knowledge to your ability. Seeking help from multiple people can have great benefits such as having different opinions to build your own opinion, different experiences to build more knowledge, and also because it's always good to have people to rely on.  
9182	Talking to multiple people such as family or friends can help you see a different point of view and encourage better choices. 
9183	opinions can help represent different point of views, 
9184	show possible solutions to an issue, 
9185	an individual can become more knowledgeable from opinions from multiple people. 
9186	It is natural to seek for advice or opinions from many people throughout life. People may ask for opinions from family or friends to solve an issue. Even so, a person might still require more opinions for confirmation or to seek a well thought solution. Such as, when a student messes up badly on a project, he or she will probably ask a teacher or friend for their opinion on what they should do to fix the mistake. But, the individual could end up asking his or her parents for their say on the matter. 
9187	multiple opinions can show you the choices you have and you can make good decisions based on them. The knowledge and understanding you can gain from different views can benefit a persons decisions and can help him or her make the best choice. So when a parent or friend offers you an opinion or some advice, take up on that offer. 
9188	With distance learning comes lack of information, as well as misinterpretation. 
9189	Online courses are often catered towards those who are taking an online class during the school year or have a full-time job. As a result, the provided resources are more concise and fail to include information for subjects that may be ambiguous, causing students to apply these concepts incorrectly. Students are unable to understand the curriculum, as compared to their peers attending school outside of their home who are given more thorough instruction for topics that online school programs may not provide an explanation for. Moreover, for those not extended the opportunity to video conference with personal tutors, students can not ask questions in real-time. Having to email your teacher about one question can end in a string of emails with the student still confused. Those who can inquire in person, however, better comprehend the information and are ultimately better equipped to understand future curriculum in subjects where each topic builds on one another. Mathematics, for instance, is cumulative. Without understanding basic Algebra, a student can not understand Calculus. Similarily, those with a lack of learning and information struggle in the future when told to apply more difficult concepts due to their misunderstanding of simple concepts. 
9190	Online school and video conferences also fail to teach students certain skills that prove to be crucial in the future, in one's career and life. 
9191	Such skills include presenting, leading, critical thinking, and even working with other students. With online courses and video conferences, there is a severe lack in the listed factors. Most assignments consist of projects, virtual laboratory experiments, research and technical papers, and, of course, tests. This is all mainly individual work, with no collaboration between other students. Making that shift from individual work to team work is not easy, and working with others is a common task in many fields, like engineering and medicine, that students will have to face in their future careers. Working in groups comes with leadership, an important attribute that students will need when they are tasked with managing a project or even running a company in their future career. In addition to collaboration and leading, presentations is another factor that distance learning fails to include. If a student, for instance, wants to obtain a business major in college, they will need to be able to present their ideas effectively and efficiently, a skill that is necessary in not just business, but in all career pathways. Although the listed skills are all important, they can ultimately be attained. One's ability to critically think, however, is not gained through viewing a slideshow posted by a teacher or video conferencing with an instructor; it gained through experience - experience you can not get at home with distance learning. All of these skills are necessary in one's future career, and without such skills or exposure to them, students will face many obstacles that public and private school would otherwise adequately prepare them for. 
9192	The described form of distance learning can be advantageous for those who are unable to attend school in person due to unforeseen issues, such as a medical diagnosis. 
9193	However, most forms of distance learning, like online classes, do not account for an individual's needs nor the distinct types of learners and how what may work for one student will not work for another. 
9194	Several students need to be in a classroom to fully understand a topic, and in most cases, learning in a classroom, outside of one's home, can be highly beneficial for certain subjects. Physics, for example, includes many experiments in its curriculum, coverin topics like sound waves. A student may have difficulty understanding sound waves through a virtual laboratory experiment, a factor that distance learning does consider because such programs choose to use one resource for all students, despite there being different types of learners, such as audio, visual, and kinesthetic. In public and private schools, however, teachers offer a variety of resources, including textbooks for visual learners, educational videos for audio learners, and phsyical, not virtual, laboratory experiments for kinesthetic learners. This, in turn, helps all students better comprehend the curriculum. 
9195	With a lack of information, opportunities to obtain skills that prove to be helpful in an individual's career, and resources that do not cater toward all types of learners, distance learning does not benefit those who plan to attend classes from their home. 
9196	Getting a second opinion is very common. People all the time ask for a second opinion. It can be as complicated as asking another doctor if you should follow through with a surgery or, it can be as simple as asking if you should buy something. Usually people ask for a second opinion because they know that the person they are asking has been in that situation before and they have experience with it. And people just want to see what other people do to see if it may work for them to, if whatever they are doing isn't working. But why else do people ask for a second opinion and, how can it help anyone make a better choice? And how often do we do it? And is having more option's better or worse to have? 
9197	People get second opinion's all the time. It's just a matter of why do people get a second opinion. 
9198	It could be that they want to see what other's would do in a certain situation or, just want help and they know that whoever they are asking has been in the same situation before and know how to help or have a suggestion for you to try out. And most people rely on second opinion's because they rule out any other options. For example, if you are debating on buying something that you want, you look at the rating's to see if other people liked it. This counts as an opinion. Or you look at the comment's section to see if it's actually what you want and if people think it's worth it. Getting a second opinion helps in everyday life. People are alway's asking for second opinion's without even realizing it. You do it all the time by asking if your hair looks good or, if they like what your wearing today. It's just a mindless thing we do. We even do it in our head we think about what people would say and we ask them what they think. It's just something everyone does all the time because it's a self conscious thing we all do. 
9199	To get second opinion you have to go ask someone. But without realizing it, we ask for second opinion's so often that it's just daily life 
9200	It could be as small as asking if our hair look's alright to the complicated payment's of a house. And some people have a job that they actually help make the very important decision's for us and they are the second opinion's in our life. They are the second opinion because you went to them to ask what to do about something. It's good to get a second opinion, it's actually recommended for you to do so. It's another option for you to choose from. An example of people who are second opinion's for a job are Financial adviser's, Consular's, and Lawyer's. Financial adviser's are people who help you make a decision with your money. They help you decide what's best for you to do and they help come up with any choice's and they let you make the decision on how to follow through. Consular's are another good example on people who help make decision's for a living. Consular's help their patient's by telling them a way to deal with problem's like bullying and mental problem's. But how can it help someone make a better choice. 
9201	It's been scientifically proven that if you have more choice's you are more likely to make a better choice than if you have less option's. So getting more opinion's help's you make a better choice. Like they say the more the merrier. But other than that it's also easier to rule out ones that don't work for you and if you have a lot and a lot of them just don't work for you, you have more to pick from. This especially help's when you have a big decision to make. When you have bigger decision's to make you usually go to people that are specialized in that area. Like Financial adviser's are specialized in money you would go to them if you need help on the money side. And if it's a mental problem or a bullying problem at school you would go to a school or out of school Consular to help you out. And asking for help isn't a bad thing at all. And if you really need help and you don't go to someone your only hurting yourself if you don't go. 
9202	Its give's you more option's, people who have already been their can be the most helpful, and overall having a second opinion can be more helpful than you know. And having more option's than you need can help you weather it's a big decision or a little one. And having more can help you pick out the one's you dont need and help you find the one's you do need. And you may find out that what someone said really helped you and you may go back to the for more advice and it's just a never ending loop to help you everyday.    
9203	Discussion among my classmates and teachers regarding online learning has been circulating throughout my school. Many of my peers and teachers have opposing views on the matter. Some students say that it would be easier, and that it would be amazing if we didn't have to be stuck in a classroom all day and sit through a lecture. While, my teachers state it would be much more challenging to teach the material, and for students to obtain it. 
9204	I do not think that online learning would be beneficial towards students 
9205	it diminishes students' creativity, 
9206	is not realistic in everyday life 
9207	would be unsuccessful due to teenagers lack of motivation. 
9208	Creativity should play a key role in a students growth throughout their education. Without being in the classroom, ways to express one's creativity would be limited. 
9209	Projects, presentations and intellectual conversations would be removed from the learning realm, and would be replaced with watching videos and staring at a computer all day. Technology has been proven to be unhealthy to adults and especially teenagers. It has rotted our brains, shortened our attention span, and removed our creativity. Our generation has been revolved around technology, and has set the stage for the future. It is no doubt that one day their will come a time when students no longer come to school to talk to their peers and learn from their teachers, but instead learn from robots, in their dark rooms, only lightened by their computer screens and cell phones. Coming to school and sitting in a classroom, where are phones zipped in our backpacks and our laptops shut, is refreshing and healthy for teenagers. With online classroom, students would not be able to take physical education and run in the fresh air, and have a break from the technology they stare at throughout the day. If we were to take online classes from home we would be constantly hovered over our computer screens, diminishing our creativity and forgetting what school used to mean.  
9210	With online school there would be few, if not any, interaction between peers or with adults. Teenagers today can barley talk to an adult without looking at their feet and avoiding eye-contact, due to the lessening of interaction in the classrooms. Online learning would only increase the problem. Most jobs across the country and throughout the rest of the world all have a form of interaction whether it is presenting a presentation, discussion in meetings, business calls, marketing, and much more. Students would be ill-prepared to step into the real world and be successful in their next step of life. Life is not seen through a computer screen and nor should it ever. 
9211	"Most teenagers do not have the discipline, or attention span to take time out of their day, everyday, to sit down at home for hours on end and learn online. Most teenagers need discipline in the classroom. When in school, if students get off track their is a teacher there to help them focus and be productive. When sitting in a desk at school, teenagers are much more productive then if they were to lay in bed at home watching videos. If one were to take online classes at home they would no longer face the discipline teachers show them everyday in school when saying, ""put your phone away!"" or ""stop talking!"" or ""wake up!"". Without teachers to help guide them in the classroom, majority of students would be on their phones, sleep, or be with their friends all day. "
9212	Overall, online learning would be ill-fitting for my generation and others to come because it destroys creativity, does not help one in the real world, and would be difficult for teenagers due to their lack of motivation. While, some may see it as a new and improved way for students to learn, be independent, and serve as a convenience; the negatives out way the positives in too many ways, especially the health of adolescent teenagers. 
9213	Saddened, I starred at my grade for Algebra 1 Honors. That year I had gotten a B average throughout all 4 quarters. That night I spent hours pondering over the different mathematics courses I could take the next year. I could either retake Algebra 1 Honors, or move up to Geometry honors. Despite the time I took weighing the two options, I was unable to reach a decision and I decided to consult with my family and friends. When I asked my friends, many of them had different reasons and exposed me to several outlooks. My mom and dad were also split down the middle. My mom believed that I should retake the course to improve my grade point average for high school, while my dad argued that the the one low grade wouldn't effect me that much because there are many other courses in high school. Finally, I asked my uncle, a wise and intelligent man, what he believed was the proper course of action. Talking with my uncle helped me figure out the right decision which was to move on to Geometry Honors 
9214	can allow anyone to see separate outlooks on situations, 
9215	lowers bias in the final decision, 
9216	can lead people to reach a decision quicker. 
9217	Throughout peoples lives, everyone has had different experiences that shaped who they are today and the choices the make. Every single decision that people make is in someway decided by there past experiences, because those experiences are what led them to an understanding of right and wrong. This leads to people having differing opinions on topics. Talking to these people is crucial because it can allow people to see both sides of the situation, and the reasons that lead them to their decision. When those reasons are taken into account a balanced conclusion can be achieved, despite the differing opinions. 
9218	For example, if someone talked to just their group of friends, their friends may say things with the sole purpose of pleasing them, leading them to an unbalanced view. On the contrary, if someone talked to a group of people who didn't have their best interests at heart, it would also lead to an unbalanced view on the situation. For example, when I was talking to my peers about retaking Algebra 1 honors, those who had decided to move to Geometry Honors all told me that I should also move on. However, those who had decided to retake Algebra and those who were taking Algebra for the first time all told me to retake Algebra. When I asked why the later group why they wanted me to retake, most of them said that it was just so I could be in their classes. However, hearing the opinions from the former group of friends helped me see the bias, and thus effected my final decision. 
9219	When a person asks the people around them for an opinion, they are often bombarded with a plethora of different reasons. However, when they talk with one person in particular it is enough to allow them to finally make a decision. For me, this person was my uncle. My uncle helped me formulate the best course of action, which took into account all of the reasons I had been exposed to, as well as statistics pertaining to the importance of a high school grade point average. He told me anecdotes from back when he was in high school, and disproved the stigma that your grades define your success in high school. This final outlook was enough to make me decide to take Geometry Honors. Although one person finally tipped the scales, without asking all of the people prior I would not have came to the same conclusion. 
9220	 Seeking a multitude of opinions when making a complex decision is crucial to making the right decision. This is because seeking different opinions exposes people to new ways of reasoning and outlooks, lowers the amount of bias, and can allow people to make a decision quicker with the aid of another person. 
9221	many people say that seeking multiple opinions can confuse the person who is asking, and will result in more problems. 
9222	This way of thinking is flawed. In most cases, the person will actually gain a sense of understanding about the topic and acquire new knowledge, allowing them to make an informed and thoughtful decision. 
9223	Advice. Advice can be important to many people, and most of the time they ask multiple people for it. 
9224	Seeking advice can sometimes be hard and asking multiple people can help you reach your final decision. Asking multiple people of their opinion helps someone make a better choice 
9225	they have more options, 
9226	quicker and easier to get a final decision, 
9227	make an overall smarter choice. 
9228	A lot of people are going to say a lot of different things about your situation. This gives you more options to make a better choice in the end. The more options you have, the more possibilities there are and then choose the one you think is best. It also gives you the opportunity to use the process of elimination for options you don't consider to be helpful. This can help for any situation you may be in. 
9229	The reason it would be easier is that the people you ask, have probably been in the same situation you are in. It is also a quicker process because other people can help you through it instead of going in alone. This is really helpful for most people because some situations are nearly impossible to do alone. It takes nearly twice as long if you were to figure out a solution on your own. 
9230	asking multiple people for advice can be really helpful to most, if not, all people. It is never easy approaching a problem by yourself which is why you should always ask for help. Asking others for advice can sometimes be the best option because you have more options to choose from while in the decision making process, you can make a decision easier and quicker, and you can arrive to an overall smarter choice from others. 
9231	it better accommodates students 
9232	helps supplement learning for home schooled students 
9233	giving students the option to take more of their desired classes online.  
9234	Online learning accommodates students with disabilities as well as students with injuries that may prevent them from easily leaving their homes. It is unfair that our education system would require that they come to school when they can learn the same, or potentially more information from home. Recently, it has become clear that online learning is feasible for an entire school. Take for example, schools in Italy or South Korea. These countries have temporarily closed their schools until April in order to better combat the novel corona virus, COVID-19. That said, the schools are still holding lessons online where attendance is taken and students are given the same education by the same teachers, only through a computer screen. If it is feasible for other nations to accommodate for their students during a health epidemic then surely we can also implement a similar program for our students during times of peace. Furthermore, we can not, both morally and legally, allow for our disabled students to receive a sub par education than their peers. That is a disservice not only to them but the moral foundation and integrity of the community as a whole. Similarly, students with mental illnesses like depression or anxiety are more likely to be productive and learn in an online setting than they are in the classroom 
9235	Offering this alternative option to these students will undoubtedly benefit in them being more productive as well as allowing more time for these individuals to seek professional help or therapy then they would normally be able to, potentially decreasing the amount of teenagers with mental illnesses in the United States and at the same time increasing the graduation rate. 
9236	A unique aspect of American public education is the fact that a large number of families choose the home school their children rather than send them to a public or private school. Of course, the success and effectiveness varies drastically from household to household but most generally follow a simple, bare bones public school curriculum with little or no instruction from a professionally licensed teacher. 
9237	If online learning or video conferencing was made available to home schooled students and be used as a supplement to a child's learning, then it will benefit the student's education. 
9238	Also, many school districts already offer online classes that are supervised by school staff that focus mostly on students learning the course material at their own pace. Take Generic_School's VISION program for example. VISION offers LCPS as well as non-LCPS students many different courses from English and math, to economics and personal finance. If home schooled students could join some of these courses, there will definitely be many benefits for both parties, not least of which is producing students who will advance our country and the world. 
9239	Continuing off of the description of Generic_Schools' VISION program, many students in this area feel that they can do a lot more with their education and choose to take classes online in addition to the classes they already take at school. Instead of being overwhelmed in the school building with all of these extra classes, students find it much more convenient and easier to take certain classes from home and at their own pace. Personally, I currently take economics and personal finance online using VISION in order to meet a graduation requirement for my county and find that I am having a much easier time learning the material than other students do in school 
9240	Another benefit of online classes is that they are essential for students who wish to take advantage of the fact that all of the courses at public schools are free. 
9241	On the other hand, critics of online learning may say that there are public academies for students who wish to specialize in STEM careers or pursue the humanities and that it is better for students to learn in a formal classroom setting rather than from at home. 
9242	It should not be an expectation for students who simply wish to pursue their interests to enter an extremely competitive and difficult environment for the same education that they could receive through less traumatic means. Although institutions like Generic_School of Science and Technology boost a student's resume, they are wholly unnecessary for students who just want to take a couple extra classes and maybe receive some extra credits. 
9243	 Although formal classroom education has been -and still remains- the standard of public education, as our society moves more and more towards complete digitization of daily life, our system of education should also keep pace and be made to offer distance learning as an option for all students for better students' accommodation, education, and choice in their education. Since this education will last our students a lifetime, we should never falter in giving them the quality education that they are entitled to in the Constitution of this great nation. 
9244	"""Why does everyone think I shouldn't go to the movie with Generic_Name?"" confusingly asks Generic_Name. The whole group just sighs and gives Generic_Name a quick glance with a voice backing it all up saying, ""She just isn't right for you that's why."" Generic_Name looks to the ground with defeat on the outside but rage filled on the inside which causes him to try giving a quick defending response. All that came out of his mouth was,""Well what if you're wrong,"" Which caused the whole group to walk away with quiet whispers and a few laughs. "
9245	it gives you different points of view, 
9246	more options to choose from, 
9247	keeps you closer to the people around you.  
9248	A great example of this is when my friend Generic_Name got in a fight once. He got sent to the office and was claiming he didn't start it and it was self defense, so they called in a few people who saw what had happened and found out Generic_Name was telling the truth. This is important because if you only ask one person they can use their bias opinion to make a person or situation seem better or worse than it actually was. Another example is in football when there is a call being made all the refs huddle up to talk about their opinions on what happened during the play. This highlights the fact that when there are multiple opinions the out come is usually better and more logical. 
9249	this happens a lot in the sports world on final plays of the game. What happens is there is not much time left on the clock so they all try to figure out the best play possible to win and try to execute it. This is only useful when there is multiple opinions and plays coming in because with out different options than the one option used might not have been the best one or the most successful. To illustrate, another time having multiple opinions is helpful is when you have a girlfriend. I had the similar thing happen to me when I was dating someone because I didn't have any ideas for a date, so when I asked my friends I had much better and more ideas. All the ideas were helpful and useful and made my date worth while. 
9250	when I asked my friends for their opinion on the sport of basketball it not only made me contact them and talk to them but now they know that I am working on a report for school. This helps all of us out because know they know i'm working on my report which means I can't hang out right now and I reminded them about it and made them do it. In addition, this happens a lot when my mom asks one of our neighbors for their opinion on a certain product, but it ends up turning into them catching up and talking for the first time in a while. This helps my mom and our neighbors to stay in touch and get better opinions on products or services. 
9251	When you are asking for advice, it is smart for you to ask for multiple opinions on the subject. 
9252	Asking for more than one persons advice and opinions on a subject is a great way to make the best choice about something. 
9253	seeking multiple opinions on something is a great way to make important decisions is because if you dont't, you could end up being offensive towards somebody. 
9254	Not only does seeking more than one opinion on something help you make the best choices and be respectful of others, but it can also help you in the future. 
9255	Your actions are never really forgotten. They can be forgiven, or almost forgotten, but they will always be tucked in your mind or somebody else's mind. Sometimes people aren't very cautious about what they say or do, and they don't think about how others might get affected by their actions. Asking multiple people for advice is greatly rewarding because it gives you a sense of many opinions and feelings on a certain subject. Having good and varying advice can help stop you from doing something you might regret later on. Instead of jumping to conclusions and caving in to your impulse, you should ask as many people as you can for advice. That way, you can have time to think about what to do in a bad situation. 
9256	Advancements in how we are providing education continue to grow in the number of options for how one is receiving their education, Attending classes in school is a way that a majority of people receive their education, although some students are provided the opportunity and option to receive education outside of the typical school environment, this being options to learn from home. These options can include online courses, or a video conference. 
9257	Students would not benefit from an education outside of the school environment as much as they would attending school 
9258	being separated from a learning environment makes it more difficult to complete work and focus, 
9259	participating in an online course allows for a lack of communication and ideas from other peers, 
9260	receiving help from a teacher or an instructor would be more limited and restricted if one were to take an online course.  
9261	When working in an environment other than school, in this case at home, there is a removed focus of the student due to the setting they are in, and it may make learning more difficult in terms of concentration. 
9262	Take for example, completing an online course. When students are at home taking the online course, they are placed in a more comfortable environment that lacks a working ambiance. Consequently, there is a greater chance that the student could focus their attention away from the work because of distractions that may include: television, chores, video games, and others. They may also more easily have the tendency to slack off and fall behind. While completing work at a school, students are surrounded by materials that place them in the mindset of their education, and provided help and support that encourages learning and success, rather than the at home comforts. Fortunately, at school there are a limited number of things that will focus ones attention away from what is needed to be completed, and done to the fullest potential with effort. In a working environment the encouragement to learn not only comes from the instructors, but also the other students that also attend the school. 
9263	Provided a student takes a course outside of a school, they are not always given the opportunity to have other peers around that are earning the same education. 
9264	but what is so beneficial from attending a school is that students are exposed to other ideas developed by other students, and can participate in engaging discussions to make further achievements. 
9265	Through these shared concepts, students can learn and comprehend more information off of one another, and make connections through certain ideas that are shared in class. This is demonstrated not only through group assignments, but through the participation of students during a class lesson. When a student is called on to share aloud, they are sharing an idea that may benefit someone else's learning experience, and help with their improvement and understanding of the curriculum in the class. School group projects allow students to share their ideas towards one another and further their comprehension of the relevant information. The students may develop a new way to perceive the topic, which, beneficially, is crucial for their success in the course and in the future. Ideas are not only defined through other students, but are defined through the professionalism the teachers carry in the course. 
9266	Students knowledge is generated through in person help from instructors, given that students struggle to make a connection and perceive the topic. 
9267	Online courses do not give the opportunity for students to ask engaging and purposeful questions to help them make achievements. If students who are participating in taking an online course at home begin to struggle in a course, the lack of communication from someone who is experienced may further complicate that situation; however teachers i school direct students primarily to succeed in the course, and are willing to provide all the help necessary for a student's success. Even if students are taking a course through, for example a video conference, they still are not gaining the same help. If a video conference lesson was for a math course, it would be complicated for a teacher to view the mistakes made on practice that a student completed, and directly present to them what they did incorrectly. Teachers roles are to expand and elaborate on topics, so a student is able to gain a full understanding of the curriculum necessary for a test, or a future assessment. Those who are taking a course at home do not gain that full elaboration or background knowledge as a student who is receiving in person instruction would. 
9268	It is crucial for a person who wants a full and purposeful learning experience to attend an actual school. 
9269	Although some may make claim that taking a course at home provides for more personal time to complete other necessary tasks, and can learn the same information as those who are attending an actual school, 
9270	those that are not educated in a school aren't receiving the same fulfillment and educational opportunities as those who are educated in a school environment. 
9271	Some may also believe that at home courses aren't as complex and are more flexible, 
9272	but they allow for more mistakes, and less knowledge gained through them. 
9273	Schools are not only beneficial but are crucial success not only in the courses they are taking, but in future roles, whether that be, for example, in a career, or becoming financially stable. Secondary options to attending a school, like courses at home, are not the same and do not hold the same roles or positions as a school do in the sense of a person's success.  
9274	Once, there was a woman named Generic_Name who was tasked with budgeting her family's money and spending it in the best way. She needed to decide whether to stay home during Spring break and spend a little more on food and eating out more often, or she could go on a vacation and use less money on dining out. There is no bad decision here, she thinks, but the vacation that her family wants is very expensive so budgeting would be harder. She asks her friend, Generic_Name, who just took a family vacation, about whether she should take out money to spend on this lavish vacation. She decides, based on Generic_Name's opinion and based on her own, that she should allot funds to this vacation that the family wants over Spring break, and eat out less often. She found later that she made the poorer of the two decisions. Did you know that many people around the world receive advice every day, and learn that the advice they received was incorrect. Those people deeply regret their decision that they made earlier that was incorrect 
9275	it allows you more views of a topic 
9276	it is mathematically easier to make a decision with multiple opinions. 
9277	When you are seeking advice you will have a higher chance of finding the correct decision because getting multiple options can make finding the general consensus easier, it can help you in finding poor decisions, and it gives you past decisions to see what happened and what might happen to you 
9278	When you know several opinions, you have a better understanding of how others feel about the issue and can reach a general consensus, what the majority of people think, about the topic that you are deciding upon, which can make the correct advice easier to find. By seeking multiple opinions, you can find which ones are poor choices and which ones are ingenious ideas and doing this can make finding correct advice easier. If you seek multiple opinions, you may find out that others have had to make the same decision and had a positive outcome who'se decision you may want to follow. You also may find people who have made bad choices that you would not want to follow. By doing these three things, you increase your chances of finding correct information in the advice that others give you. If you get correct advice by asking multiple people, or if you don't ask anyone and make the wrong choice, you would be on trend mathematically with how many people you talk to, and your result. 
9279	For many decisions, you don't need advice of your peers, but some do, and it is best for those that you get more than one opinion. Studies have shown, that the more sources you have, the more likely you are to make a correct decision, and likewise, the less sources you have, the weaker your decision will be. When you have more people's opinions, you have a higher chance of finding the general consensus and making the correct decision. By mathematics and by logic, you should be able to find correct advice if you have more opinions and beliefs. 
9280	Generic_Name found out much later that she made the wrong decision about the Spring break vacation. While her family was on vacation, she learned that there was a Martian Flu outbreak at her office and she will not be able to work along with her husband, who was recently fired.  When Generic_Name made the decision, she should have known that many of her coworkers had Martian Flu and that it was starting to spread when she planned the vacation. She lost two paychecks and they had to live on savings for a few months until they ran out of savings. Generic_Name's husband got a loan from the bank and they barely had enough food to survive, but Generic_Name learned her lesson. This lesson was when making a major decision, you should seek multiple opinions before you make the final decision. When people make a decision, they sometimes don't get a second or third opinion, and they make a poor choice. If only these people were able to make a better decision and be given more. Had they asked more people for advice, they would be able to see that they were wrong and that the other people were correct. In order to make a correct decision, you need to seek advice and this helps you by giving you more points of view, gives you a higher chance of finding correct advice, and puts math on your side. So next time you need advice, ask multiple people their decision, this will drastically improve the outcome of your decision. 
9281	Getting multiple different types of advice will help make a better choice by giving you different options to choose from. By getting other peoples advice and have an option you can decide on. You pick the advice that would best benefit you and help you. Seeing what would other people would do if they were in the same boat as you and how they would take care of it will make you want to make the right one. I think it's a good thing that people ask more than one person for advice because I like to the answer a problem that I feel the most comfortable with and that I know won't get me in trouble. I feel like asking multiple people for advice is great because you trying to fix a problem and you are thinking about solutions and getting more than one way to go about it. You also see how others would act in a problem so I think getting multiple advice is important. 
9282	There are numerous reasons why getting advice from multiple people can be advantageous 
9283	some people could be more educated in the topic than others 
9284	every person will have a different perspective. 
9285	If someone who does not know much about the topic is asked, they might not give the best, up-to-date answer. However, someone who is knowledgeable in that specific area will probably be able to connect with the subject and give better advice to help. For example, if someone asks what color the sky is, one person could say it is red, and another person could say that it is purple, but a scientist that was asked could say that it is blue. The scientist would be more educated on this subject. Therefore, they would be able to provide the more helpful answer. If the one asking had only talked to one person, it is more likely that they would get an incorrect answer or a response that is not as beneficial. 
9286	Some people will feel positively about the topic while others feel negatively. People have their own opinions and their opinions are how they form an answer. For instance, if someone asks someone else for advice on where they should go for dinner, the action relies on the answer that the person gives. If they say that they should go to a certain restaurant, it could be because the person giving advice likes that restaurant. On the other hand, if the person asks multiple people, they will get a variety of answers because everybody has a different opinion. The more people that someone asks, the more answers that they will get. Therefore giving them a plethora of opinions to base their choice off of. 
9287	There are many reasons why someone should ask multiple people for advice including getting a more educated answer and receiving different opinions. Asking more than one person would provide someone with better advice and a variety of answers. Whether somebody asks two or five people, all of the answers that are given will lead them to make better choices. 
9288	My footsteps seemed impossibly loud as I walked into the classroom, and it felt as if everyone was watching me. I glanced around, taking in the unfamiliar eyes staring me down.  I'm never going to fit in here.  One of the eyes turned away from me and began to speak. She formed strange sounds with her mouth in a language that wasn't familiar to me. I turned around and ran out of the room, feeling so alone, so deserted. Salty tears stained my cheeks.  A week ago, I had taken a 14 hour long flight from  Generic_City to Generic_City. It was my first time being somewhere else other than my home country, and I felt so intimidated by the new environment. Strange shapes, strange sounds, and strange people with impossibly bright hair and piercing eyes surrounded me. It was all beautiful to me - but at the same time, the most horrifying thing I'd ever seen. I felt trapped in a haze. This haze was brimming with thoughts of never fitting in, never adapting to these alien surroundings, and mostly - the crushing feeling of homesickness.  This haze pushed me down into a deep cavern, and I was encapsulated by darkness. Even though my parents tried to find me in this cavern, every search effort was in vain, until something miraculous happened. An angel, perhaps, entered the deep labyrinth and ushered me out. Her name was Ms. Generic_Name. She gave me a new perspective, a new bias. Ms. Generic_Name told me to view this unfamiliar atmosphere as something special, a new opportunity - not a hostile monster trying to swallow me whole. She told me to be glad of the change in my life. This was the first time I had ever listened to somebody's opinion and savored it in my heart. I didn't know the importance of listening to the viewpoints of others at the time. I thought  I always knew what was best; after all, nobody knew me better than myself. I took her words and used them as fuel for learning English and making friends. I thought her words were all I needed, but somehow, I was still in despair. I still struggled. So - I decided to let someone else tell me what they thought was best.  After school, I talked with my parents. I told them what I felt, that I was always alone. That I felt so, so homesick. They told me it was good to feel that way. Moving overseas was a tough thing to endure, and they said it was healthy to let myself feel down sometimes. They told me I didn't always need to pretend I was happy when I was not. These two opinions from Ms. Generic_Name and my parents shaped me as a person - I learned to let people in, and know that seeking multiple opinions is a wise thing to do. Because of this, I learned to speak English and surround myself with a group of compassionate, kind friends who guided me through my darkest times. I learned to let in my parents and take notice that they always wanted what was best for me. I learned that I didn't always know what was best, and that was okay. 
9289	Everyone has gone through unique things. After all, our lives are not the same. What people have experienced shape them as a person, and since we're all different, some people may offer advice that's helpful to you while others may not. You'll never know if you've sought out the best advice if you only listen to one person. 
9290	If you hear multiple pieces of advice, you can learn new things, 
9291	not everyone has gone through the same things. If someone has been through something that you haven't, it can prepare you for the future and teach you a lesson. 
9292	people have different biases. 
9293	people have blind spots, because we're only human. 
9294	"One person could have partially helpful advice, and another person might have the guidance that the other was missing. If you've heard ""incomplete"" advice, such as I have, it may not help you as much as it could. If you listen to someone else's opinion, they may correct the blind spot. This would help you to the full potential. "
9295	Seeking multiple opinions is an important thing to do. When you're stuck in an impasse, these pieces of advice could be the only things to get you unstuck. Multiple opinions can help you know that you've found the best advice possible, teach you something new, and make sure you've received all the guidance you need. So, ask multiple people for their opinion. You never know what it could teach you.  
9296	they can view the other persons perspective, 
9297	they will get honest feedback, 
9298	they might find out more information on the situation.  
9299	The trusted person helping you can show you how the other person might be feeling. Sometimes knowing how they feel can change your point of view on things. The friend or family member can inform you on what you did wrong. Even if the opposing person hurt your feelings, there is a high chance you have hurt them as well! If you are confused on what the problem is they can show you what it is or how it started. For me, I need to understand how the problem started before I resolve it. Understanding how the other person felt, knowing what the problem is, and realizing what you did wrong are important things the trusted people helping you can do for you to make a better choice.  
9300	They might have gone through the same thing in the past and know how to handle it. I feel a sense of relief to know that they understand what I am going through. If you are talking to a friend they will most likely already know about the situation and can help you out more than you think. Depending on how much they know, you'll have a clear understanding of what happened and feel comfortable enough to make a good decision. Another way you can get more knowledge is figuring out how you can prevent this from happening again in the future. That is something you're gonna need! Getting advice from someone who already knows about the problem, has dealt with the same thing in the past, and keeping the advice for the future are perfect reasons why you should seek advice from not just one person, but a few.  
9301	"They will help you choose the best way to handle the situation. It always makes me feel better when the person giving me advice knows how to help me. The person can tell you if your choice is the best or not. You will most likely feel better after getting ""the okay"" from another person. Talking to a trusted person will make you feel more comfortable, especially knowing you aren't getting lied to. By then you will feel ready to make a great choice. Knowing if your decision is good or not, being told how to handle it, and talking to someone who won't lie to you will truly help you decide on a better choice. "
9302	Going to school everyday can be difficult for certain students. Many kids and adults have work, sports, or medical problems that can get in the way of their learning life. This can affect the students education gravely and it can even prevent them from moving forward in their education. Although, people prefer their children to go to school where there are teachers and people who can help them, actually, it is better to have the option to learn through an online class 
9303	because they may have certain things that can get in the way that an online class can work around like, balancing work and school, or having appointments and events at the same time school is taking place.  
9304	Every student is different and every student has a different life they have to maintain. For example, one kid may have to help support their family and is unable to attend school everyday. Even if they wanted to go the school and get an education, they have other things getting in the way. This can hold them back and hurt the education that they need to get to be able to have that steady life and career. If they were able to take an online class, that can work around their schedule, they could help their family out and also maintain an education. This shows that in certain cases online classes are needed and they should be accessible to any student that needs them. 
9305	Many parents and adults will argue that students will not get as much work done at home because there are too many distractions and there is not a teacher that can help them. 
9306	This is a good point because if you are schooled online then you are more likely to get distracted from your work and do something else instead like play with your friends. Though there may be distractions at home, 
9307	you can argue that there are many distractions at school as well. 
9308	At school you are in classes with many other people and many times your friends can distract you from your work. In both scenarios something or someone always has the risk of distracting you. This doesn't mean that online classes shouldn't be an option. 
9309	Schools should be able to accommodate to their students to be able to give everyone the best education that is accessible to them. 
9310	Some say that you won't be able to reach a teacher through online classes as much as you would in a classroom where there is always a teacher on hand. 
9311	Though you may not have a teacher in the room with you to hep tell you what to do; there are many other resources you can use now, such as YouTube,Google, and you can even email a teacher or professor and get your answers through them. 
9312	This shows that there may be many arguments against having online classes but there is always going to be a way you can get around them. Not everyone has to take online classes, either way, people should still be able to have that option available. 
9313	In conclusion, many people will argue that online classes prevent productive learning and it is better just to go to school everyday, this can actually slow down certain peoples education and prevent them from moving forward. If you have a medical problem or are unable to go to school everyday due to sports or work, you should still be able to take online classes that can work around your busy schedule and allow you to get an proper education while also doing your everyday tasks. Though there may be some areas in online classes that bring up questions like whether students will be able to get all their work done from home, there are many ways around these problems that schools should be able to figure out, to make their students educations as good as in classrooms. There are too many benefits to online classes to not consider them. Online classes will change the dynamics of education but they will change them for the better. Students should have a right to to decide whether to go to school and focus on their education in a facility that promotes learning, students should also have the option to choose whether to take online classes and focus on other aspects of their life like their career or interests. 
9314	During a long day at school, have you ever thought what would it be like to be home schooled? Home schooling, or distance learning, is a route that many young people choose to do as their education. Many people wonder however, how beneficial is it really for students to sit in their living room instead of the classroom? As many schools offer distance learning as an option, students can learn online or have video conferences with teachers. This could be beneficial for students to go at their own pace, however, there are more factors to both regular and online school than people may think. 
9315	Technology has given education a new pathway for young people to learn and grow their future due to distance learning; however, taking classes from home is not as beneficial as learning in school 
9316	due to the distractions for students at home 
9317	the lack of socialization.  
9318	Home for many people is their comfort zone, as well as a place for people to do things they enjoy like hobies, sleep etc; home can also be a danger zone for productivity like school work because of the many distractions that the classroom doesn't have. 
9319	In today's world, things like video games, cell phones, and computers fill up teenagers lives and distract them from things like homework. Schools and classrooms however, either have don't have those distractions or put limits on them to keep students working and not playing games or texting. If some people can't even complete their homework because of these distractions at home, then how will they complete their daily home schooling assignments on top of that? Student work completion would drop and their futures will be impacted dramatically. Many people, especially teenagers, need guidance and restrictions in order to get work done. Even though some students have already created that habit for themselves of getting work done, others have not and giving them an option of distance learning will be devastating for them. 
9320	At school, students interact with each other throughout the entire day, these social interactions are healthy as we humans require to talk and be around people; home schooled students dont nearly get half the amount of social interaction as students who attend regular school do. 
9321	We as humans need social interaction, that is why we have friends and family because we need people around us. School provides for most of your early life friends and sometimes even long term friendships. Students who attend classes at home will not get these important early life relationships; this makes it harder for them to adapt and create relationships with people in the future when they are adults. As well as different social interactions we have whether good or bad, we learn from for the future. These interactions build social skills that are needed for the workplace. If students are not getting these key workplace skills to communicate, than it will be hard for them to succeed later in life. Regular school provides a social environment and communication to students which is imperative for later life in for the workplace; unlike home schooling where the necessary amount of human interaction is very low. 
9322	One major difference between regular school and home school is the pace at which student work at; home schooling does have the advantage at which students can work at their own pace, which leads to understanding the content at a better rate. 
9323	A significant problem in schools today, is students getting behind the pace of the class and having to rush in order to catch up. This leads to them not fully grasping the full understanding of what's being taught. Students will also tend to produce sloppier work when rushing and getting a worse grade than they could have. Home school however, does not have this problem as students can go at their own pace whether its fast or slow. This helps students get the grades they deserve instead of rushing and having them not produce their best effort. Having home schooled students work at their own pace also creates beneficial work habits due to them actually doing the full amount of work. If students are not completing the required amount of work or more, than they may start to think that it's appropriate to only give half of their best effort instead of putting the full amount of work in for an assignment. 
9324	While home school give students the opportunity to work at their own pace and complete assignments with their best effort, regular school however provides tools to do the same thing (after school, study hall, and teacher assistance). 
9325	Technology is a major factor in our world today as it has both positives and negatives. It has also brought major change into the education system as now students may have an option to learn online instead of the traditional classroom. While online learning is new to education, it has also brought up the argument about whether it's more or less beneficial than regular school. Unfortunately, common problems arise with online learning that effect the young and future generations of our society. Taking classes from home may allow students to work at their own pace, but due to distractions at home and the decrease of social interaction, home schooling is less beneficial than going to regular school.
